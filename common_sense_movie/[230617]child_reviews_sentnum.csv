574,264번,Ant-Man,8,I personally enjoyed this movie  It was funny the plot was decent and thankfully for me and probably others there wasnt much in terms of sexual innuendos  There was some kissing and a comment related to this topic but overall it wasnt as bad as Iron Man,3
575,264번,Ant-Man,8,Clever funny cool Marvel movie that has lots of scifi action,1
576,264번,Ant-Man,8,A vary good movie  It is a superhero movie so theres a lot of violence but not intense and scary violence like the Batman  It shows a grate message of a past criminal in for robbery rehabilitating in the outside world well also being a superhero,3
577,264번,Ant-Man,8,Antman is funny and a little violent  The violence is pretty standard for comic book violence and It never gets to gory  Some Language,3
578,264번,Ant-Man,8,I watched Ant Man in theatres in Switzerland with my brother and my mom  Unlike most reviews here mines going to be unique yet hysterical  My mom kept on making snippy comments mainly she said the most dumbest things ever  When the main character Scott wanted to see his daughter his wife took him aside to explain all of the pay that men were pressured to do  The theatre was quiet as a mouse and my mom said out loud unrighteous btch  When Scott finally finds the AntMan suit and tries to put the helmet on my mom immediately said that was like from the movie Mask  Using the powers suit to shrink down to a small size Scott tries to escape the CGI effects of a tsunami in the bathtub  My mom immediately said that was in 3D  We normally watched the movie in 2D  With moms comments aside the movie is a must watch  There is not a lot of violence as in the other Marvel movies  The sequel to it is not bad  Recommend it to teens and adults 15,13
579,264번,Ant-Man,8,I might be a bit biased considering this was the first PG13 and the first Marvel movie Ive ever watched but I loved this movie It has humor that was totally on my level  I wouldnt say it has too much swearing although there is an abundant use of language throughout  It doesnt have any gory fight scenes besides a short gunfight near the end  My sibling says that it is the mildest Marvel movie in the entire franchise  If youre looking to introduce your kid to Marvel movies I believe this would be the movie to start with,6
580,264번,Ant-Man,8,Scott Lang an engineer who committed a crime he felt that was justified is sent to prison  When he gets out he wants to be on the straight and narrow for his daughter but having a record doesnt help  And his exwife refuses to let him see his daughter because he cant find a regular job  Eventually his friend tells him of a job and he decides to take it  Scott has to break into a vault and when he does all he finds is a weird suit  After he takes it he puts it on and discovers it shrinks him  Scott tries to return it and when he does hes arrested a man claiming to be his attorney goes to see him and he tells him that the suit was an opportunity which he should have taken  Later some ants bring him the suit and he puts it on and gets out of jail  He then goes to the man who says hes Hank Pym the man who created the suit  He used it before and called himself AntMan  He gave it up when he found out people were planning to use his technology for things he doesnt think is right so he made sure no one could replicate it and put it away  But he now needs Scott to be AntMan because it seems like his protg Darren Cross who forced him out of his company is close to replicating it  So he wants Scott to get into the lab and take it  Scott is uncertain if he can do it and Pyms daughter who thinks she should be the one to go agrees  But Pym thinks Scott is the one  So they train him while trying to make sure Cross doesnt suspect anything,16
581,264번,Ant-Man,8,What I enjoyed about the movie is that it has a lot of action and fighting  I think characters are pretty cool  The story was nice  And I think its the best movie EVER,4
587,264번,Ant-Man,7,Ant man is a great marvel movie for younger and older kids  There isnt to much violnce and you dont see anyone die but one person does get shot but lives  overall ant man was a really good movie for most ages and you should watch it,4
588,264번,Ant-Man,7,Not even appropriate for adults  A man brags about touching a womans private part in one scene to name just one which I dont even think is PG13 content DO NOT WATCH,3
589,264번,Ant-Man,7,Ant man is just a great movie and is quite family friendly,1
590,264번,Ant-Man,7,Family friendly unless you consider people getting punched by a practically invisible shrunken ant man violent or bad  This movie is so good and I recommend it  It is no worse than guardians of the galaxy and it is similar to oceans 11  It does have bad words but I think that is the worst part about this movie  I watched it once one night and it was so good I watched the sequel and it a 2nd time the next morning,5
591,264번,Ant-Man,7,I think its a really good movie for ages eight and up its really funny its definitely a movie Ill watch again,1
592,264번,Ant-Man,7,AntMan is a great film  Its a pretty different Marvel film with a man who can turn into the size of an ant  It has many cool special effects especially when Scott turns small and has enough charm and action to appeal to many Marvel fans  The film also has a good and funny cast like Paul Rudd Michael Pea and Michael Douglas,4
593,264번,Ant-Man,7,A funny one  With strong swearing and violent,2
594,264번,Ant-Man,7,It is ok but it is not at the same time for 8or7,1
725,276번,Aquaman,8,I did not like it that much  I have to mention that there is a kissing scene I have watch the movie when it was released but I remember this scene lasted like a minute of two,2
726,276번,Aquaman,8,Aquaman2018,1
727,276번,Aquaman,8,Ugh I hated this movie  Just bad,2
728,276번,Aquaman,8,it is only slightly violent and it has very harmless swear words,1
729,276번,Aquaman,8,I found this movie quite good  There was quite a bit of violence especially when aqua man stabs the guy at the start  Maybe watch the movie with your kids because it is very good and has good message s and story line,3
730,276번,Aquaman,8,A Must watch for everyone   It becomes clear that Jason Momoa is the perfect actor for Aquaman  Hes absolutely hilarious and I especially noticed the way that how the actor adapts to the various scenes environment  Really enjoyed the movie  Suitable for all ages,5
731,276번,Aquaman,8,Dont mind that guy this movie is good better than the avengers movie  aquaman is a hero what do you expect  For it to be 1  because i watched this movie before and the trideint its so cool i almost forgot this movie because i like watched this movie like 2 years ago but nevermid that i wish i could give this movie 120005000099999  Stars and black manta he is that guy in the ship and  i dont know how he is in that suit but this movie is just so cool,3
732,276번,Aquaman,8,doesnt really have anything bad in them just a little bit of violence  Sorta a cheesy movie though,2
733,276번,Aquaman,8,At the beginning of the movie violence someone dies when black manga fights aquaman Aquaman gets very badly injured in a scary way that will scare young people and thats the only scene with blood and in the scene theres a lot of destruction  Finally when Aquaman and Aquamans wife get attack by creepyscary monsters the first couple monsters get killed by getting stabbed then more monsters come and  That will scare young viewers  Also theres way to much swearing for a superhero movie,4
734,276번,Aquaman,8,all dc movies are very mediocre but this is one is almost at marvel qaulity,2
735,276번,Aquaman,8,Aquaman was a pretty good movie  I had a lot of fun with it and I was rarely bored  Many fans of the DCEU will appreciate and be fond of this entertaining charming and witty undersea adventure  Most tweens will be relatively fine watching this movie  They may get a bit scared at some of the more disturbing scenes but the movie is pretty okay for them,5
736,276번,Aquaman,8,very good movie but a bit violent  kids might find Black Manta creepy,2
737,276번,Aquaman,8,I love how light hearted and fun some DCEU films have been because it being dark and grim most of the time isnt the greatest  The CGI is kind of wonky at times but it works for me  The action was fun and exciting  The plot isnt the greatest and sometimes the movie drags a lot more then I thought  While it is entertaining youll probably be glancing at your watch every now and then  The acting from Mamoa himself is definitely fantastic and he brings Aquaman man to life and making me look forward to the future of the DCEU  I would give Aquaman a 80100,7
738,276번,Aquaman,8,I watched this as a prekid and I watched it alot of times  Yes there may be some innuendo or violence but it is all payed offworth it  I remember this movie and WATCHED IT AGAIN because why not,3
1106,292번,Arthur Christmas,7,Its a fabulous and funny holiday movie about the Christmas spirit,1
1107,292번,Arthur Christmas,7,We liked it so much its going into the xmas rotation,1
1108,292번,Arthur Christmas,7,It was really funny when it turned into a steam  train    It was weird when the old man was walking  it would take him an hour to get to the control room  it was only scary when they thought Santa was gonna be gone forever and they pressed a button and the santa made out of ice fell from the top of the control room   It was weird when Arthur Christmas took out the the Christmas game and everyone was arguing over the santa which was funny,4
1109,292번,Arthur Christmas,7,The elves are treated very poorly in this film  I dont know the elves name but her head was wrapped in gift wrap and GrandSanta only allowed he to breath once  They also threaten elves and treat them like objects  I couldnt get over the way they were treated  Also  I read a review that quoted a character saying If we taught women to read we can do this but I just wanted to point out that they actually said we used to think teaching women to read was impossible  I just wanted to state that  But the film is still a bit offensive in my opinion as they dont shine a lot of spot light of female characters or on characters of colour  If someone who believes in Santa watches this it might distort their image of Santa Claus  In this film Santa decides not to help get a kid their gift  a kid accidentally didnt receive their gift and Arthur had to do it instead  I know that the movie has a good meaning but it was too predictable and mediocre  I dont suggest that you watch this film,12
1110,292번,Arthur Christmas,7,This is a fine movie  My mum and dad explained it is just a film and that is not really how Santa delivers presents,2
1111,292번,Arthur Christmas,7,I dont really get some of the parents reviews because I get the mentions of sexism because the main characters are mainly white men and mrs claus doesnt get mentioned much but she was portrayed as more intelligent than Father Christmas but that was just me probably  Also there is Bryany Shelfly the elf and she seemed to be a strong and not too annoying character  Also some people said that it ruined Christmas for their kids but it made it a lot better for me because I was starting to question if father Christmas is real but this film makes it a lot more believable,3
1112,292번,Arthur Christmas,7,This movie is totally family fun and cool good movie in all,1
1113,292번,Arthur Christmas,7,I love love love Arthur Christmas It seems to appeal to everyone  adults and kids  My 18 year old cousin loved it just as much as I did THIS IS A MUST WATCH,5
1114,292번,Arthur Christmas,7,Just a beautiful story The Christmas aspect is amazing I just love this movie And for the last time this movie is DOES NOT feature anything inappropriate or rude,4
1115,292번,Arthur Christmas,7,There was a little action but I think 3 year olds would be ok   Had some funny scenes and good messages,1
2517,339번,Barbie and the Secret Door,7,I give this an extra star because the mermaid didnt know what a boy was  meaning everyone is gay ,1
2518,339번,Barbie and the Secret Door,7,This show is very traumatising for children under the age of 18 it has some really cringe moments and can be very scary at times  and it is has way too much violence because the unicorns horns get ripped off sometimes the fairies wings this show is cruel to the unicorns,2
2519,339번,Barbie and the Secret Door,7,One of the best movies Ive ever seen appropriate for all ages in my opinion,1
2520,339번,Barbie and the Secret Door,7,It is very creative  I also think it is magical and funny   It has some cute creatures in it  It is different than most Barbie movies,4
2581,350번,Barbie Mariposa & the Fairy Princess,6,Loved the message the art style the writing and most of all I loved the chemistry between Mariposa and Katiana  I think Willa and Carlos might become something in the future but I mean PLEASE  Katiana showed Mari her favourite place gave Mari special gifts they went on adventures  now come on now  Im gonna ignore that the movie wanted us to believe that Carlos Mari are  made for eachother  Plus near the beginning of the movie mari even rolled her eyes when zee zee suggested the crush so     yeah 3 I happy,6
2582,350번,Barbie Mariposa & the Fairy Princess,6,Mariposa and the fairy princess is a good movie for kids 3 or higher  They set good role models of being nice and that the best way to make a friend is to be a friend,2
2887,361번,Batman vs. Robin,8,I think this movie was great but too much blood and gore especially when the villain took out the toy makers heart,1
2888,361번,Batman vs. Robin,8,Young and old rich and poor Batman geeks and normal people all will be disappointed at this DC Universe film,1
2889,361번,Batman vs. Robin,8,Ok sorry about my earlier review on this movie it was inaccurate  My mind has changed on several things  This movie is awesome and trying very hard to get several points across which youll have to figure out what its saying for yourself  This isnt a kids cartoon its a teen movie thats a morality tale ethical and esoteric in  many ways  I want you to watch this but only if youll understand it,5
2890,361번,Batman vs. Robin,8,I think that this movie is super violent there is a scene where a kid is getting punched by his dad and there is cruelty to animals when bruce wayne young shoots an arrow at an owl and kills it   And a guy gets his heart ripped out,2
2891,361번,Batman vs. Robin,8,My rating R for strong shockingdisturbing violence,1
3221,389번,Beetlejuice,8,it is michael keaton at his best,1
3222,389번,Beetlejuice,8,Its a reasonably good film though having seen Burtons other work I dont personally hold it in as high esteem as say Corpse Bride or Edward Scissorhands ,1
3223,389번,Beetlejuice,8,beetlejuice walks into a strip club  He walks in from the outside so we dont see inside the club at all   says a fword  some skeletons not scary,4
3224,389번,Beetlejuice,8,The only thing that got to me is beetlejuice saying Nice ing model and st but I say Dont show this to kids they will get foul mouthed,1
3225,389번,Beetlejuice,8,This is one of the weirdest WinnieThePoohRideatDisneyWorldlike Burtonist movies I have ever seen  I enjoyed the comedic presence of Beetleguse and wish he was in it for more of the movie and I thought all of the main actors were great  The story is just so weird I cant seem to love it,3
3226,389번,Beetlejuice,8,I think this is a great movie  But it is still best for older kids  Beetlejuice has a creepy look that can easily scare younger kids  Infrequent use of mild to moderate language except for 2 uses of fk includes the H word and one use of st  Because of the F and S words I think it shouldve gotten a PG13 rating since it was released late enough  But this is a really funny movie that I would recommend for Tim Burton and Halloween fans 11 and up,5
3227,389번,Beetlejuice,8,I watched this when I was around 6 so I didnt really understand what was going on but I do highly remember the fact that a ghost has a slit through someone has slit wrists and the rip their faces clean off  This isnt scary but if you have an easy to break stomach do not watch this,2
3228,389번,Beetlejuice,8,Has some swearing including the Fbomb and others  Not that scary in violence but some gore  Also a lot of smoking and drinking and some drugs,3
3229,389번,Beetlejuice,8,I wasnt allowed to watch this movie until last year I dont know what version this is but the version I watched was a 15,2
3230,389번,Beetlejuice,8,An epic family comedy for all to enjoy Its a fun movie with a hint of creepieness  And though there isnt much swearing when there is it is pretty bad and there is a scene where they find a ghost hung in a closet and it deffinently made me jump There are lots of people that have been graphically injured in some way but the way they look is only laughable  There is nothing that tweens cant laugh at and I think the official 15 rating makes no sense and I think that a 12 A or PG 13 for you Americans rating would make much more sense  Over all its a great family movie for all to enjoy,6
3416,407번,Benji,5,I remember watching this when i was younger and I really liked it mainly for its music though the scene where the kidnappers kill Benjis love interest is kinda violent for a Grated movie,1
3417,407번,Benji,5,We watched this movie  school and it was good UNTIL the girlfriend dog gets kicked  We did not get to watch the end so everybody thought the girlfriend dog died   Over all it was very cute  ,4
3418,407번,Benji,5,My 5 year old is pretty sensitive kid and we were caught offguard when there was a real gun firing when the children were kidnapped and gagged and when Benjis little sweetheart dog was kicked by a grownup   Of course my memories of it as a child were pretty benign but found it jolting to watch it with my little one   Were still stuck on Sound of Music and Singin in the Rain,3
3576,423번,Big Hero 6,6,Great animated comedy is fun for the family,1
3577,423번,Big Hero 6,6,I was 6 when I saw this and I was a diehard Elsa fangirl who wanted to see this movie because the trailer mentioned Frozen,1
3578,423번,Big Hero 6,6,I think Big Hero 6 is a good movie and it is ok for a 4 year old  It teaches about science and robotics  This movie is one of my favorite Disney movies and I recommend it for the whole family to watch,3
3579,423번,Big Hero 6,6,Big Hero 6 is a great family movie packed with the right amount of intensity and funniness  Having an amazing story line and characters but also containing some rather violent scenes  The Bad guy betrays the main characters Hero and his friends after his daughter to what seems gets lost in time   When at first being friendly character then later on in the movie at surprise scene his identity gets revealed after his mask comes off  These scenescontent possibly being a little intense for younger viewers  The main characters also getting beaten up quite frequently in those scenes not showing any blood or struggle pain scenes  Also the main characters older brother dying early on in a fire which could be hard on younger viewers as well  One PART TO DEFINITELY WATCH OUT FOR is when spoiler FYI Bay max technically sacrifices himself to save Hero and another character  This always tends to be quite sad even if you have watched the movie before  I was about 8 years old when I first watched this movie and was extremely sad  when scene occurred  Just saying I assume for most kids it would be sad in the moment then breeze by after but if your child takes things deeper  I would recommend watching the scene first before showing your child or bring some tissues  Overall being a fantastic movie almost guaranty you will enjoy this one no matter the age   Highly recommend this one,14
3580,423번,Big Hero 6,6,Although Hiros brother dies the rest of the movie is awesome I showed this to my 2 and 3 year old cousins and they loved it so much that they begged my aunty to watch it the next morning great family movie great  for kids of all ages,1
3581,423번,Big Hero 6,6,This movie is really good  Like really good  Stop what you are doing and WATCH IT,3
3582,423번,Big Hero 6,6,Funny educational great messages and role models no swearing may scare younger kids intense  violence,1
3583,423번,Big Hero 6,6,This is the second best kids action the ending is sad then becomes happy hope they make a second one,1
3584,423번,Big Hero 6,6,this movie is so good but a little sad but cool ,1
3876,429번,Billy Elliot,8,Great movie has strong language  A touching film  that clearly displays the life of an eleven year old boy fighting for his dreams amidst all the chaos of an 1980s miners strike  The film defies gender stereotypes and gives a message to kids and teens to just do what you love and dont let anyone the conditions youre in or the amount of money you have stop you,3
3877,429번,Billy Elliot,8,Fair about of fbombs but I think Its well worth it for the story,1
3878,429번,Billy Elliot,8,Billy elliot is bad  The language is not that bad with about 30 fwords   The violence is mild but a brief sight of blood could set sensitive people off  Some heated arguments  I actually thought there was a lot more sexual content than everyone said  I girl asks a boy if he wants to see her fanny vagina and they start kissing sensually,6
3879,429번,Billy Elliot,8,This is an amazing film with positive messages about sexuality homophobia and a lot of other things  I watched it with my paretspand my 10yearold brother  The scene with Debbie and Billy in the bedroom was pretty awkward Theres a lot of bad language in the film fk st ct I think fanny but kids swear more than adults anyway its not going to change anything  Im reviewing the full 15 version not the PG one,5
3880,429번,Billy Elliot,8,This movie was amazing to see  Beware of strong language however  This movie is about a young boy who wants to do ballet however his father is not ok with it  A very emotional movie,4
3881,429번,Billy Elliot,8,To much inappropriate comments and swearing,1
3882,429번,Billy Elliot,8,There is a lot of swearing but overall a great movie,1
3883,429번,Billy Elliot,8,Do not let your children watch this it is inappropriate And very stupid,2
3884,429번,Billy Elliot,8,I thought this was a really great movie An awesome roll model for kids growing up into teens  It also showed me that to never give up and try your hardest for the things you believe in or want   But there was a lot of swearing and a bit of violence so maybe not the best for younger or immature kids but overall it was an entertaining and often times hilarious movie that you orand your kids will LOVE,4
3885,429번,Billy Elliot,8,My ratingR for pervasive language some racy content,1
4151,446번,Black Panther,8,Went to the movies theater when it came out AMAZING MOVIE was my favorite movies till spiderman into the spider verse came outcheck out my review on that Mild violence one middle finger not recommended for small children great movie though,1
4152,446번,Black Panther,8,This is possibly the best Marvel movie so far  The action is awesome the story is great and the characters are interesting and diverse  Some of the violence may be too much for younger kids  There are a lot of shootings and deaths  Michael B  Jordans character is cruel and disturbing at times  12 and up,6
4153,446번,Black Panther,8,i realy like this movie you should let your kids watch this movie,1
4154,446번,Black Panther,8,This was not my favorite but its ok  There is some swearing but not much  It has a great storyboard and I think it is fine for a mature eight year old,3
4155,446번,Black Panther,8,THIS IS INCREDIBLE This movie is my perfect marvel movie  I love everything I love how this movie has so much emotion and is so powerful it will really tugs at the heartstrings  It has a perfect balance of action emotion plot everything in between  Most marvel movies have men characters but this movie has awesome women warrior characters my favorites are Shuri Okoye Nakia and let me just say Everyone  This is my all time favorite Marvel Movie Watch it,8
4156,446번,Black Panther,8,Message a teamwork and loyalty  The first black hero and a message on never giving up Fightingexplosions and even A death happen in the movie Stand Hell are said infrequently  No Real sex in this movie  Its Part of the marvel cinematic universe Some Drinking in one scene,3
4157,446번,Black Panther,8,Great film  Favorite Marvel film so far,2
4158,446번,Black Panther,8,This movie is one of the best I have ever watched in my life but it did use consumerism violence and swearing  Though it had these it conveyed great messages and inspired us to support everyone no matter their background  It did not use sex or drugdrinkingsmoking but I would still recommend watching it with a parent or a group of friends  But if you are  8 and understand certain words are bad then I think you could still watch it,4
4159,446번,Black Panther,8,This is a really good movies for families There are a couple violent scenes and SPOILER the guy who tries to take over Wakanda is a little creepy with the knifescarthing on his upper body      but a good movie for celebrating black families Another thing a VERY good movie to watch right now especially with COVID and the BLACK LIVES MATTER thing  Great family movie definitly would watch again and probaly will,4
4170,446번,Black Panther,6,TOO MUCH VIOLENCE  FOR KIDS,2
4171,446번,Black Panther,6,this is a good movie I recommend this,1
4172,446번,Black Panther,6,I thought that this movie was good but kids under 13 might have a hard time following it understanding it  Also the violence was really intense  But I thought that it had good messages and role models,3
4173,446번,Black Panther,6,It has swearing and Blood and the religion might be confusing for Kids,1
4174,446번,Black Panther,6,i think this movie is great its just kinda violent thats all,1
4175,446번,Black Panther,6,This movie will be good to take an 10 year old out to see a movie but mild language is my concern,1
4176,446번,Black Panther,6,This movie gives info about the strength of black people everybody knows that black panther represents the strength of black people and it just says damn hell sht and other BUT its great  At the end of the movie tchalla and nakia kiss  but its not to sexual  and the movie puts out great messages,4
4177,446번,Black Panther,6,well there is quite a lot of violence characters get stabbed multiple times murder as punishment etc remind your kid or teen that this is just acting and special effects  Also there is some positivity in it  It has a message that no matter what race you are you can still do many great things  but one part I didnt like was that two characters kiss at the end  blah   There is a minimal amount of swearing  I grew up around swear words and such so if you dont want your kidteen hearing that I recommend not watching this with youre kidteen  I hope this review helped you in some way,7
4206,446번,Black Panther,8,Ive seen marvel movies better than thissuch as Thor  Although it is good it has some violent scene  Rude moments suggestive and blood is seen  I think this is better than Doctor Strange but this is still a boring MARVEL movie  Kids should not see this movie by it self,5
4207,446번,Black Panther,8,This movie is awesome action packed and gets you on the edge of your seat  Quite violent though,2
4208,446번,Black Panther,8,Black Panther is a beautiful movie with an excellent storyline and positive role models  It really values the importance of culture and diversity and supports equality for all females and males,2
4209,446번,Black Panther,8,it is very good and full of action,1
4210,446번,Black Panther,8,This is a great movie There is a lot of violence  But there is no blood  There is lots of positive messages too   I think this is appropriate for tweens,5
4211,446번,Black Panther,8,Amazing film with fun drama and superhero action,1
4212,446번,Black Panther,8,Fine movie  Watched like a million times  Knowing marvel movies this ones on the more graphic violent side but its not the worst  There are several scenes of bloody punching and stabbing and one seen of aman laying on the ground and is shot  Nothing sexual,5
4213,446번,Black Panther,8,It was a great movie that includes action adventure and story  A good movie about culture May be intense for younger children,2
4737,459번,Blazing Saddles,7,I watched this when I  was 12  My parents are strong believers in not sugar coating things and this is one of my dads favourite ever films  I also love this film and rally recommend it  It does have the nword in it so I recommend talking to your kids about why they should never ever say this work before watching the film  There are some sexual bits and you will have to be prepared to answer awkward questions that your kids may ask  In conclusion I think this is a great film and it is a great spoof western,6
4738,459번,Blazing Saddles,7,Blazing Saddles is a 1974 comedy directed by Mel Brooks and starring Cleavon Little Gene Wilder Madeline Kahn Harvey Korman Dom Deluise and Mel Brooks,1
4739,459번,Blazing Saddles,7,I saw this first when I was in 6th grade and even then I got the satire and loved the movie  Yes it has the nword and has offensive jokes But thats the point  Its not glorifying racism its making fun of the people who actually hold those beliefs like Its Always Sunny In Philadelphias humor does  Yes there are some jokes that havent aged well like the gay jokes but the amount of stillhilarious jokes override that number so much its still a really enjoyable film and a great satire  And if it counts for anything Mel Brooks asked the black star Cleavon Little about the frequent  use of the nword and he gave it the OK  If people are complaining that its racist and offensive they just dont see or get the satire and the fact that its making fun of bigots and making them laughable to take away their power like how Mel Brooks does with Hitler and nazis in The Producers and other hateful groups in so many of his movies  There is sexual jokes and implications and a scantily clad woman  There is swearing as well as some brief light violence  Definitely give it a watch,9
4740,459번,Blazing Saddles,7,Fish out of water flick attempts to satirize racism but doesnt hold up during the 21st century  There are a few Mel Brooksstyle chuckles including the magical finale  Critics are blinded my nostalgia to see the overratedness within,3
4741,459번,Blazing Saddles,7,I watched this movie when I  was 13 and I found it HILARIOUS I watch many crude comedies mostly R rated comedy movies and I thought this was pretty clean for being R  Some racial stuff language but no nudity,2
4742,459번,Blazing Saddles,7,Theres lots of innappropriate humor in here  A priest makes a reference to cattle rped  Many uses of the n word as this is based on the 1800s  Lots of language such as a rape joke  The women Well rape the sht out of them at the party Many sexual jokes and innuendos throughout the movie lots of cleavage  One character is gay or at least the others think he is  Otherwise very funny movie but pay attention to the r rating,9
4743,459번,Blazing Saddles,7,This movie is hilarious but very inappropriate and has a lot of foul language  They say st and the N word but a good movie  The actors were perfect for their roles and all contributed to the hilarity of the movie,3
4744,459번,Blazing Saddles,7,The American Film Institute didnt vote this the 6th funniest American film of all time for nothing  This Western spoof makes fun of practically all there is to make fun of race sex religion cultural stereotypes collective thought and most of all modern society and is crammed with totally inappropriate jokes concerning these topics  Above all the underlying social satire Blazing Saddles is essentially the story of a greedy state official who plans to uproot an entire town to make way for his new railway  The desperate townspeople appeal to the state governor for a new sheriff and are glad when they are sent one  only to be unspeakably shocked when they realise the new sheriff is black  Overall the film is a sly satire on popular culture with tons of overthetop slapstick but may be over some kids heads especially as the last 10 minutes does away with any notion of conventional storytelling,5
4745,459번,Blazing Saddles,7,I LOVE this movie Its my favorite Mel Brooks film my favorite comedy and probably my favorite movie in general  I especially appreciate the films antiracism message  I definitely recommend it to any Mel Brooks fan,4
4746,459번,Blazing Saddles,7,Not as funny as Spaceballs for kids in my age range but I still loved it  Has some drinking and a little bit of drug use as well as a lot of racism but it shows how stupid people are when they hate other people that are different than themselves  Very good film,3
4893,478번,Bolt,8,Superdog adventure is fun and ageappropriate for kids,1
4894,478번,Bolt,8,This movie shouldnt be watched by any kid under 6 for the violent scene at the end with Penny and Bolt  That one scene influenced the whole movie to be PG for me  If your undersixyearold kid loves action or suspence then this is the movie for them  If not dont hesitate to ignore,4
4895,478번,Bolt,8,Explosions galore in funny witty actioner,1
4896,478번,Bolt,8,I thought this film was awesome when it first came out  Since I was a kid who loved dogs and superheroes it was basically everything I could ask for  Now that Im older I dont like it quite as much as I used to  The violence is alright for kids there is no swearing and basically zero sexuality  Its also got heart humor and engaging action  Its certainly something entertaining for the younguns  continue for more detail,7
4897,478번,Bolt,8,This is a really good movie with lots of fun action  the main scary type bit is towards the end with the treat of the fire,2
4898,478번,Bolt,8,Its kinda a baby movie but otherwise its fine,1
4899,478번,Bolt,8,BOLT is full of good jokes and lots of fast action I especially loved the hamster in his clear ball running around and being brave and silly,2
4900,478번,Bolt,8,it is a bit scary,1
4901,478번,Bolt,8,I dont love this movie  It is kind of bland for a family movie  Pick something else,3
4902,478번,Bolt,8,Great movie I think  Will be nice if it was less violent,2
5170,492번,Boy and the World,7,I think this movie was okay I also think that it should be for 7 because there were some sad parts like when there was a war between the people who wanted to protect the environment and people who wanted to take down the environment and replace it with houses and big companies,1
5320,508번,Brave,8,An interesting movie with an empowering message  Its a grate story but it might be a bit too violent for younger children  The reason I rated it 11 is not because it had too much violence in it but because it have a very complex meaning hidden in it  It was even complex for me If you really want to enjoy it you have to understand it  Overall a great story with a great message,6
5321,508번,Brave,8,This movie is a really good one to skip especially for sensitive kids,1
5322,508번,Brave,8,Ive seen Frozen 2 and Wreck it Ralph Breaks the Internet both pale in comparison to the awfulness of this movie,1
5323,508번,Brave,8,i love this movie  such great role models music and animations  It also embodies the importance of family relationships  great movie,4
5324,508번,Brave,8,I would almost put this under a mild horror movie label and a family film at the same time  I guess it just depends on how tough your kids are with animated violence and creepiness since there are scenes I felt were a bit much for younger kids  SPOILER ALERT For example when Meridas mother turns into a bear and when she wasnt acting like her human self at times  The witch her magic and her cottage was also creepy  Another bear  who looked rotted and beaten  from an ancient story was also shown trying to kill Merida and her family  It really depends on what kind of kid you have I guess,6
5325,508번,Brave,8,I finished this movie tonight and it rules My mom said shed watch this movie over again I used to be scared but now Im not  I took a quiz on ohmy disney com and apparently Im a cross of Merida and Belle,4
5326,508번,Brave,8,Great movie  Theres a great message  But theres some mild violence and scariness  There is no bloodshed or guns but it is definitely scary for kids under the age of 7,4
5327,508번,Brave,8,This film was traumatic for 4 year old me  Children at that age arent really able to comprehend whats happening and just see people turning into bears and trying to kill each other  However when watched at the right age its a great film with a good role model and comedic at times,3
5328,508번,Brave,8,scary a little  good movie  very sad,3
5355,508번,Brave,8,This movie is not good,1
5356,508번,Brave,8,Not pixars best  Pretty scary movie as well,2
5357,508번,Brave,8,It has a great plot The characters are awesome and I LOVE how it takes place in Scotland They use traditional Scottish music in in the movie and I absolutely LOVE their accents You should watch this movie I shows the traditions of Scotland too,6
5358,508번,Brave,8,It is a good movie but it is too scary for younger kids,1
5359,508번,Brave,8,i really like the movie brave and there are some parts that are scary and the tiniest bit inappropriate  the main character Merida and her mother go on an adventure to turn mom back into a human instead of a,2
5360,508번,Brave,8,This movie was much better than many people thought it was in my opinion   It was one of the first movies I saw at the movie theater and I enjoyed it a whole lot,2
5361,508번,Brave,8,i love this,1
5362,508번,Brave,8,This shows that even girls can be strong  This is about family and is a MUST for family movie nights,2
5363,508번,Brave,8,Because this movie is produced by Pixar its a lot better than any Disney Princess movie  The main character is strong and independent and an awesome role model  Unlike Disney movies there is no romance crap in the film  Plot is exciting and action filled the musical score is beautiful and overall great movie,4
5364,508번,Brave,8,My ratingPG13 for intense sequences of fantasy violence and disturbing sequences of action,1
5385,508번,Brave,7,Come on my 7 year old sister loved it she watched every Harry Potter too now she is 8  It is not scary I was laughing,2
5386,508번,Brave,7,Good movie  There is some violence with Meridas mom turning into a bear  Also a big demon bear is the scariest part  It comes and attacks the characters in three scenes  Positive messages Follow your heart and dont let others control you  Educational with learning about Scotland life in medieval times,6
5387,508번,Brave,7,Has mild scary scenes and a bear attack but in all has a good message about family,1
5388,508번,Brave,7,Hello This is my review on Brave  I will be telling the story also if I liked it or not  Hope this helps,4
5389,508번,Brave,7,Produced by Pixar and released by Walt Disney Pictures Brave is a story about a motherdaughter relationship  I have to admit that when we watched it in the cinema it was a little scary and there were some violence and some inappropriate content for young children therefore I think it is suitable for children ages at least 8  above but other than that it is a good movie with a strong and positive moral,2
5390,508번,Brave,7,I was nine years old when I saw this movie with my parents in the threatens in 3d and I almost had nightmares literally the scary bear action gave me the heebie newbies and I was scared of elinors bear transformation  And I even almost cried at the end of the movie overall it was good but it would scare some kids  Note not for little children,3
5391,508번,Brave,7,This is a very action packed Pixar film  I love the graphics the animation and just everything,2
5392,508번,Brave,7,Lots of violence and inappropriate scenes  Also I found that the movie gets a little boring near the end,2
5393,508번,Brave,7,i havent seen it and dont want to since a lot of pixar fans said it wasnt  all that good,1
5394,508번,Brave,7,I am 7 years old and I love this movie   But it was a little scary because of the scary bear   But over all I liked it a lot,3
7040,582번,Cars 2,3,anyone who is saying this is a bad movie and not for kids is DEAD WRONG  My brother is 6 YEARS OLD and he absolutely adored it it not only shows very good graphics and was well put together but it ALSO shows that nothing should get in the way of friendship  there was absolutely NO extreme violence NO cars being Tortured NO glorifying guns and NO UPFRONT DEATH sure it implies in the beginning that they found an agent and squashed him and yes HE died if thats what even happens to cars but no one under the age of 7 could possibly understand what happened in that scene Honestly from seeing the commercials i thought itd be a horrible movie but it was great I was surprised theres nothing that could be considered real violence unless you count missiles that are poorly aimed and simply shake them in the opposite direction violence  i dont understand what people are saying about it being not for kids  i mean sure theirs some adult humor but children dont understand it and its for the purpose of making the movie fun for EVERYONE Come on sure it has some intense scenes but unless you parents TELL your 47 year old Oh their about to die that things gonna crush them  Oh look they lied  Oh look he did something stupid  then they arent gonna say a THING  in fact they just might like it so parents dont influence your childs view on movies just because you think its inappropriate  let them make up their minds  Im here to tell you just because a person writes a long review doesnt mean that thats what youre going to think of the movie see for yourself,18
7041,582번,Cars 2,3,Cars 2 does deserve a PG rating based on the violence but I have no clue what made all the other reviewers deside that kids should not see this movie   Even though there is a scene of what I consider torture to a car and cars motors being overheated that does not make a movie horrible it makes it innappropriate   Cars 2 in my opinion was an excellent film and I reccomend it to families but be prepared for some violence   I will agree that it does seem like a tamed James Bond movie but overall a hilarious great Pixar film,4
7042,582번,Cars 2,3,Great for 710 year olds who want to see movies with violence,1
7043,582번,Cars 2,3,I think this movie wasnt a true creation of PIXAR I read the reviews on here and I see everyone hating this movie and calling it the The first terrible PIXAR movie  Yes it is more violent and the story is confusingin my opinion But this probably isnt PIXARS fault  My theory is that Disney maybe rushed PIXAR into making this movie since the recent gross revenue of Toy Story 3 was over 1 billion and became one of the most successful kids movies of the decade  Which possibly means Disney wants PIXAR to make sequels of their successful movies because they think that will make them more money so what ruined PIXAR you ask It was probably money,5
7044,582번,Cars 2,3,HAAHAHA Great for kids any age  Take my word for it This movie is so funny It is a suggestion and recommendation,5
7045,582번,Cars 2,3,i think that Cars 2 is an absoletly a good movie for every age to see and it is very funny so i think you should watch it with anyone,1
7046,582번,Cars 2,3,I was honestly dissapointed with the secod movie of the orignal cars  Cars the original was funny and a great family movie  But i was shocked at all the gun fights and killing of cars in this movie  And it wasnt as funny enjoyable and definetly not as kid friendly as the first     Bottom line very dissapointing this movie should have a PG rateing,4
7047,582번,Cars 2,3,I took my 4 year old son to watch Cars 2 over the weekend  It was his first movie theater experience and we have been counting down the days for months for this movie to come out  Unfortunately I was really disappointed by how much violence and inappropriate banter and language there was within the film  My son plugged his ears throughout various fighting scenes and was very aware that Lightning McQueen was trying to get killed in the movie  I am stunned that this movie is rated G  Honestly if I had known there was so much violence in the film I would have passed  Sadly this feature is NOTHING like the first Cars  So disappointed,7
7048,582번,Cars 2,3,You see I think some parents are exaggerating about the violence although there is a lot my older sister and I were a little shocked when we found out some cars were actully killed,1
7049,582번,Cars 2,3,Honestly we took our three year old to see this and it was not appropriate in the least   In fact my child tried to emulate the gun violence immediately when we got home      and this was a new behavior for him   Its as if the movie explicitly taught him how to do it     not that he wouldnt have learned it at some other point but little did I know he was learn it today,3
7102,583번,Cars 3,8,Cars 3 wasnt bad but it definitely did not meet Pixars high standards   The script was weak and there was nothing memorable at all   It will entertain your kids however and there is never a dull moment   There is zero bad language and no violence   But Cars 3 is flatout disappointment,5
7103,583번,Cars 3,8,I loved this movie   I think it is the of the three Cars series  I like this film the best because this isnt the average Disney  Pixar movie  This is a movie for the whole family  To prove it my brother is two and he sat through this whole movie and he loved it  I like how now Lightning McQueen is getting older  As I was watching I felt like the little kid again watching the first Cars movie  This fun family comedy is about new and improved race cars and they get faster than one of my all time favorite characters Lightning McQueen  Lightning gets into a crash  This leads Lightning McQueen to get a trainer  This leads to trouble  I was surprised this film was so good  considering how bad the second movie Cars 2 was   The reason I think this film is OK for kids six and up is because there are some intense crashes and Lightning McQueen said  Lifes a beach  Overall I recommend this movie to any family or any car loving kid,14
7104,583번,Cars 3,8,Wow cars 3 is actually a good film  Its better than cars 2 which wasnt good in my opinion  This movie is perfect for kids 4 and up  Theres no bad language or name calling lifes is a beach and then you drive  is said by lightning though lol Young  Kids wont get it,6
7105,583번,Cars 3,8,I think Cars 3 is an awesome  It teaches kids to believe in yourself and that males and females are equal  I recommend this movie for kids 7 and up and its a must see for fans of the Cars franchise,3
7106,583번,Cars 3,8,It was a great story the new car Storm and the great old Litning McQueen,1
7107,583번,Cars 3,8,For the third movie of this sofartrilogy this was great In my opinion theres nothing much to be cautious about except for the devistating and dramatic crash in,2
7108,583번,Cars 3,8,I understand this movie was  made to show girls they can do whatever they want to  my self as a girl who dreams of racing this movie honestly made me cry for an hour straight  It was so heart touching and amazing  but the ending broke me into pieces  end of a day its a kids movie you expect a happy for lightning to win and all the glory to be his  but no,2
7109,583번,Cars 3,8,I loved the movie but I have one issue  No kachow was said and Im not impressed at all,2
7110,583번,Cars 3,8,This movie was absolutely fantastic It kept you on the edge of your seat all while having comical relief too  It maintained the storyline very well  The only thing I didnt like about it was the ending    When you wait all that time to see lighting McQueen race and win the race and then he doesnt even finish the race its REALLY disappointing  I believe that he shouldve finished that race and then gone into being the crew chief  Cars was the first movie I ever watched as a kid and this movie really broke my heart It crushed all the life out of me,8
7368,587번,Casino Royale (2006),8,The first of the Daniel Craig bond series is no doubt the best one as well  This film is about James Bond who has recently been promoted to 007  status has been sent on a mission to stop a terrorist organisation from getting 100s of millions of pounds  I rated this film 13 because it has lots of graphic violence dark themes and a shocking torture scene  It also has a sex scene where nothing is shown but it has lots of kissing,4
7369,587번,Casino Royale (2006),8,Good movie awesome figt scene really talented actors would recommend for kids 13 and up,1
7370,587번,Casino Royale (2006),8,Its a good film but theres lots of violence and sex   The card game is thrilling and action scenes are great   Wait till you kids get older but they HAVE TO see this film,3
7371,587번,Casino Royale (2006),8,A classic bond film with several heart stopping moments and there are several moments that leave you asking How did he do this out of great acting and an even better plot line  With a few twists and turns on the way this film will not let you dont  It met all expectations,4
7372,587번,Casino Royale (2006),8,This is my personal favorite movie  Honestly it is the closest to a perfect film I have ever seen,2
7373,587번,Casino Royale (2006),8,jeepers i have never seen a film so violent  there is a torture scene that is so brutal  there are so many violent scenes like bond throwing people down stairs killing eachother in very brutal ways,3
7374,587번,Casino Royale (2006),8,It is a good film but has more violence than the other Daniel Craig films  A man gets drowned in a sink  James Bond gets tortured in a torture chamber  There is a fight on a stair case with knifes  There is a 2 minute scene of Bond strangling a man on the floor  Plenty of blood and gore  Lots of gunshots and stabbing  Some bad language and lots of sexual scenes  When bond kisses a girl topless for about three minutes and kisses more then this is the most sexual one by far  Also a Lady gets drowned in a cage,10
7375,587번,Casino Royale (2006),8,This is my absolute favorite film in the James Bond franchise and in general  The plot line is unparalleled and extraordinarily intriguing  I would highly recommend watching it is truly a fantastic film,3
7376,587번,Casino Royale (2006),8,An ok bond movie,1
7377,587번,Casino Royale (2006),8,Language 3 510  Violence 810  Sex Content 510,1
7378,587번,Casino Royale (2006),8,Casino Royale is my all time favorite James Bond movie and Ive seen all 26 This movie follows the book by Ian Flemming much more closely than the original movie  Plus Daniel Craig is absolutely amazing,3
7379,587번,Casino Royale (2006),8,My ratingPG13 for violencesexualitynuditytorture and drug use,1
7380,587번,Casino Royale (2006),8,I saw this with my sisters and it was amazing  Im a die hard bond fan  I loved every minute of it My favorite character was Vesper Lynd  I think its a great movie for all famlies,5
7381,587번,Casino Royale (2006),8,I know  This is a James Bond movie many people around here are not allowed to see them but surprisingly Martin Campbell does one heck of a rare thrilling job  A ton better than Skyfall it moves the James Bond genre to something like a Superhero movies while still keeping physics in mind,3
7382,587번,Casino Royale (2006),8,This movie was good but there was not enough action and even I 12  years old  didnt even understand this movie   A kid who is under 1213 years old shouldnt see this movie  Its hard to understand the concept of this movie  The rule James Bond had was to trust no one There is also blood dripping down Bonds face and strong body,5
7383,587번,Casino Royale (2006),8,This was one of the first Bond movies I saw and I loved it  Having that said keep in mind that we are talking about a James Bond movie this meaning that there are scenes of nudity violence drugs gambling and foul language  This movie is most certainly not suitable for children under 12,3
7384,587번,Casino Royale (2006),8,My ratingR for graphic violencegraphic racy contentand brief strong language,1
7490,592번,Cast Away,8,This movie has a good bit of violence blood and gore,1
7491,592번,Cast Away,8,This is one of the best movies E V E R This is oddly smiliar to a movie by matt damon called the martian where he is stranded on mars if your child has watched the martian which has way more language and violence then this movie should be fine,2
7492,592번,Cast Away,8,Meh  Its ok  I mean it wasnt awful but it wasnt that great either  I had to close my eyes at a lot of moments in the movie and I love the movies The Hunger Games World War Z Cloverfield and War of the Worlds  CSM was right about it being emotionally intense It was kind of disappointing  But I guess its an option if youre bored,6
7493,592번,Cast Away,8,In many scenes there is violence and it is very emotional  He does change throughout the course of the film though which is good  He learns how to strive for his own life  In one scene he takes his tooth out with a figure skate and a rock which may be unsettling  Same as when a person is found dead just beneath the surface of the water,5
7494,592번,Cast Away,8,I loved this movie it has a great story and it keeps you on the edge of your seat  I chose aged 13 and up purely on the fact that that it wasnt scary but there is slightly graphic images of injuries and also a disturbing scene with a floating dead body which had a pale white face,2
7495,592번,Cast Away,8,Hahaha its good,1
7496,592번,Cast Away,8,This is one of my all time favorite movies but it is hard to watch and very emotional  It gets very sad and may be too much for little kids to take,2
7497,592번,Cast Away,8,Cast Away makes you really feel how it would be to survive on a dessert island   Though the main character Chuck Nolan says God Dt St Hole talking about the island he is trapped on  Overall this is a great movie to anyone who is mature enough to understand it,3
7498,592번,Cast Away,8,Before he gets on the island hes in a plane and it crashes  That part may be scary for some people because there is some blood and a violent death  But i liked his relationship with his volleyball Wilson  One of the sadest parts in the movie is when they get separated,4
7519,593번,Castle in the Sky,8,I had seen the movie a couple times previous but recently showed it to my younger sisters 4 and 6 who absolutely loved it There is some violence including a scene where the male lead Pazu gets pistolwhipped but I wouldnt say it was enough to steer you off the movie  The younger of the two had a bit of an issue when they were having difficulties saving Sheeta but again It wasnt that big of a deal  And after assuring her that the girl would be ok she calmed down  Both the male and female leads are strong and have great character development especially Sheeta who learns to have faith in herself and her strength which I think is a great message for kids to learn,5
7520,593번,Castle in the Sky,8,I watched this last night with my 6 year old sister and she was a bit frightened in the battle scenes but she was fine after that  This has been my favourite film since I was 8  I cried half the way through not because it was sad but because it is so well written  If your kids arent scared by a bit of violence then this is perfect to introduce them to studio Ghilbi,4
7521,593번,Castle in the Sky,8,If youre looking for an excuse to get back into watching Studio Ghibli movies search no further,2
7522,593번,Castle in the Sky,8,Castle in the Sky is the perfect international adventure film It is very violent because one of the main characters almost gets shot and its a 9 year old so please be aware of that and Studio Ghibil is the perfect way to introduce anime to kids and I love the movie please go watch it,2
7523,593번,Castle in the Sky,8,Im going to just say what concerned caregivers should know as to not give anything away  This is a cute and wonderful movie  However it is violent and you should know the kid you want to show it to  This movie can be suitable for much younger audiences than 8 but it does contain guns and explosions  No one dies or is injured understand that the violence relates only to the weapons  So be sure that the kid can handle a little excitement,6
7524,593번,Castle in the Sky,8,Although I loved this movie I think that it does take a while to get really good but it is totally worth watching the whole 2 hour movie to see the ending  Also its surpisingly really violent,2
7525,593번,Castle in the Sky,8,This movie is awesome I almost have no words for it My hole family and me  watched it yesterday until 10 pm and we all loved it Its an awesome movie a great message and roll model  The only thing there is is guns and shooting but its not really scary my family watched it and my brother watched it and hes 6  There is a tiny bit of violence from the guns but its a great animated movie,6
7526,593번,Castle in the Sky,8,a great well formed movie for those wanting to start studio ghibli  good for families with positive messages for all  has little racial representation,3
7527,593번,Castle in the Sky,8,I think the  movie was the best I have ever seen I loved all the battle scenes,1
7528,593번,Castle in the Sky,8,i think its a wonderfull movie i mean you can float in the sky with that necklesss i think its magical fun but aliitle of violence like when muska,1
7832,611번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,The incidents in this movie are CooCoo Do not see this movie,3
7833,611번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,I thought that this film was very sweet and very bright to its source material with a couple of surprises of its own  The performances by the younger kids was just right the direction was superb the visuals were so mystical and the storyline was just right to the classic book itself  The only criticism I have of this movie is that Johnny Depps performance as Willy Wonka was not one of his best performances I have seen with him  He doesnt make a compelling and mysterious Willy Wonka his character is meanspirited he looks like half Shirley Temple and half Carol Burnett and he looks like a woman  Overall I thought that this film was very exhilarating and true to its purpose and source material of the book and that it will entertain many people of any age  Kids and 8 year olds are meant to see this movie if they are fans of the book and 1971 movie version and even adults can see this movie as well for its imagination and fun purpose  Younger kids under 8 years old are probably not meant to see this movie for its quirky situations action and mild language,7
7834,611번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,Theres no option for too much horror but if there was thats what this would have  Its not actually scary but for a 3 year old its creepy  A boy is sucked up a tube and taken away a girl turns blue and becomes a huge blueberry and is rolled away a girl is pushed down a shoot to an incenerator and a boy is shrunk to microscopic size  All the kids survive however  One use of retard is the worst language youll hear nothing else really  Just keep in mind its a dark Tim Burton movie,6
7835,611번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,alluring fun and sweet movie overtelling the classic tale  staring the outstanding Johnny Depp  a must watch for the whole family  eat chocolate and let yourself relax in a swirl of candy while watching Charlie and the chocolate factory,4
7836,611번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,It might not surpass the original but it was still great  The acting well done,2
7837,611번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,started to like it got bored of it after the 8th time,1
7838,611번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,First time I watched this movie I liked it but since I watched this movie so many times its not that great anymore,1
7839,611번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,It is a really good movie It has good educational value because it tells you not to be greedy  The actors do really good jobs  I also really like Johnny Depp he is really funny ,3
7840,611번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,Great film for all the family  However some scenes of moderate peril could be upsetting or distressing to younger children  Carries a very strong positive message that should be shared,3

8286,647번,Cinderella (2015),8,Brutall treatments   I suggest kids watch under 8 with an adult  This has some sex couple kisses and aloving couple getting married  The stepmother is very cruel and it could offend young ones,4
8287,647번,Cinderella (2015),8,The film is great It has all the original characters including Ella the stepsisters Drizella and Anastasia Lady Tremaine the stepmother and Prince Kit  This version of the story is a lot more detailed than the original though  It shows Ellas childhood plus the death of her parents which was pretty sad  The death of Ellas Mom was especially sad because she fell ill and it showed the scene when she died  Anyways the movie is great especially if you grew up watching the original or always wanted more details  I recommend this as a great family film,6
8288,647번,Cinderella (2015),8,I know a lot of you want a flashy entertaining movie but something can be said for just a well done retelling  Its okay to change the plot slightly but I do not understand why so many movies ruin the morels of each story  This movie stays faithful to the morals and truth of Cinderella  This is a very well done movie  Excellent job,5
8289,647번,Cinderella (2015),8,This take on classic tale is told in many ways but this remake is something else  Its beautifulstunningand its the type of movie that everyone can laughcryand enjoy together,2
8290,647번,Cinderella (2015),8,I think this movie is better than the original animated Cinderella film because it is much more exciting and has more depth even though it is scarier and more mature for younger kids  Its really entertaining and great for Disney fans,2
8291,647번,Cinderella (2015),8,Courageous and Kind Ella whose parents had recently pass away lived the life of a servant under the rule of her cruel step mother   The heroine now called Cinderella because of the cinder and ash she slept near was played by Lily James   The evil stepmother was played by Academy Award Winner Cate Blanchett and the dashing and handsome prince was played by Richard Madden   Cinderella released in 2015 is a live adaptation of the Disney animated classic by acclaimed director Kenneth Branagh   This fairy tale based in a land far far away with a gorgeous countryside and colorful characters was a beautiful film to watch,6
8292,647번,Cinderella (2015),8,Beautiful adaption of a timeless classic perfect for your  little princes and princesses 12 and this is one of my favourite movies The dresses made by Sandy Powell could not be more gorgeous and though this adaptation lacks the unforgettable musical score from the 1950 original you will still be stunned at what a beautiful emotional movie Disney has made Also not forgetting the cast that may appeal to older viewers including Richard Madden AKA Robb Stark from Game of Thrones as Prince Kit Charming Lily James AKA Lady Rose from Downton Abbey which highly pleased my mother as Cinderella Cate Blanchett AKA Elizabeth from the movie of the same name as Lady Tremainethe stepmother and Helena Bonham Carter AKA Bellatrix from Harry Potter as Fairy Godmother You NEED to see this movie as it is one of the most beautiful films ever made for kids and adults I give Cinderella 55 stars and say its ok for kids ages 5,6
8293,647번,Cinderella (2015),8,I feel like this adaptation didnt live up to the original movie at all  I felt like it was all too dramatic in the end  Sure Id watch it with someone else if they wanted me too but never alone  Not that its scary I just dont like that they felt the need to make this more dark  If your kids are expecting the lighthearted cheer that the cartoon had skip this one,5
8294,647번,Cinderella (2015),8,Okay movie but too much like the old fairy tale   Not very exciting   The main characters were too perfect they were always doing only the right thing and being too nice,3
8295,647번,Cinderella (2015),8,It had really good actors but it was boring because you already know the plot and everything it practically had nothing scary there isnt much to say about it,1
8304,647번,Cinderella (2015),8,It was a waste of money to make such a movie  Bad actors that cannot cry or even pretend to be sad  A big disappointment  Children need new stories and not Cinderella 100,4
8305,647번,Cinderella (2015),8,Love everything in the movie Nothing wrong with the movie,2
8306,647번,Cinderella (2015),8,This movie made me cry  Best Movie Ever,2
8307,647번,Cinderella (2015),8,I loved this film  Im a Disney freak and seeing Cinderella come to life in a liveaction movie excited me so say the least   I was a little put off by the new portrayal of the fairy godmother but otherwise I was oohing and aahing over that beautiful dress  Lady Tremaine was brillant too,4
8308,647번,Cinderella (2015),8,A magical stunning beautiful gorgeous looking retelling of a great fairy tale  Lily James and Richard Madden were excellent as the titular characters  Cate Blanchett was excellent as well  Kids will love it  Grade A,5
8309,647번,Cinderella (2015),8,Like the original story Cinderella plays out slowly with less romance than you want  But compared to Maleficent this film was a pretty decent remake  It had well casted actors and beautiful scenery  However young girls may feel intimidated by Cinderellas personality   Talk with your kids about how girls should stand up for themselves  Also the actress playing Cinderella is very skinny  I would not recommend this film to very young girls,7
8310,647번,Cinderella (2015),8,Not for kids 15  under,1
8311,647번,Cinderella (2015),8,Great movie All ages Loved it,3

9148,23번,23 Blast,8,There is some language  Just a little of d word and h word  But no doubt one of the best messages and amazing role models  His friend was drinking a little but he later was sorry  If you have kids that like sports but all of the good ones are inappropriate this one is great A great movie,6

9386,37번,A Bug's Life,8,This is by far my favourite movie ever have a t shirt and everything of it their is brief flirting between Atta and Flick but will be overlooked by most children viewers the film has some briefly frightening scenes but overall its a Pixar classicputs antz where it should be at the bottom,1
9387,37번,A Bug's Life,8,Since Pixar was still testing out the CGI technology after their first movie about plastic smooth toys they made a movie about exoskeletonclad smooth bugs  It may be lesserknown than Toy Story but it is as good  It has the same message as Antz but it is better in every way  While Antz was very brown this is very colorful  While the Antz characters fall into the uncanny valley this has cute characters  While all the Antz characters look the same the circus bugs in this movie are very different from each other  While the Antz story is slow this one is almost as tightly paced as Toy Story or the Lego Movie though ABL drags in the middle a bit  While Antz is GORY A Bugs Life just has mild peril  The story involves an ant colony which does the stuff ants do  Collect food carry it back to storage that stuff  Children who watch this will learn about what ants do  There is one ant forgot his name who wants to stand out but ends up accidentally ruining the other ants work  Then there is a grasshopper colony who steals the food the ants collect  The ants have all just accepted that the grasshoppers take their food but the aforementioned one ant wants to get the grasshoppers to go away and runs off to recruit warrior bugs  That is just the almostspoilerfree version of the first 30 to 45 minutes  The circus bugs the ant finds are very different from one another  But they all have likeable traits and are funny and charming to watch  Theres the ladybug the caterpillar the stick bug and others  They are circus performers not warriors but end up having the stuff to help save the day anyway  The grasshoppers are love to hate villains  The storyline gets slow at times like during part of the middle stretch but its not a snooze like Antzs slow plot  Overall Pixars lesserknown second movie is a treat nearly as good as their first but sadly more overlooked  One last note There is a slightly morbid image made by the child ants in the movie that depicts the circus bugs dead and gory with humorous comments from the awkwardfeeling adults,23

9389,37번,A Bug's Life,8,A Bugs Life may not be the best of Pixar but it is still great  It has some memorable laughs and great characters  I would recommend this to ages 16 and older because there is lots of violence and language,3
9390,37번,A Bug's Life,8,It was not that good  I started the first 5 minutes and did not like it  I dont recommend it for you,3
9391,37번,A Bug's Life,8,there is too much ant sex for me I mean geez have you seen the lady bug abomination thing The main ant thing is too stupid for me waste of time,2
9392,37번,A Bug's Life,8,This movie has good role models such as Flik the ant  While watching this movie I notice something wrong with the ants they only have 4 legs and being an insect they should have 6 legs not 4 I fear that this might not teach younger children the proper appearance of an ant,2
9393,37번,A Bug's Life,8,On par with Cars as the most underappreciated Pixar movie,1
9394,37번,A Bug's Life,8,Its a very good movie but some kids wont really enjoy it  And it has some swearing that are mean to one ant named Flick,2

10380,80번,A Star Is Born (1954),8,Ive been a Judy Garland fan since lockdown  This is about a woman Esther Hoffman Howard  Esther Blodgett who is a singer and works for a drunk producer Norman Maine  She changes her stage name to Vicki Lester  I would say that its got a lot of violence a tiny touch of sex and some drinking,4
10553,89번,Abominable,7,Funny heartwarming adventure has some peril and scares,1
10554,89번,Abominable,7,This film features AAPI role models and is a perfect choice for family movie night  Though there is a little peril the great messages are strong throughout the entire film teaching kids to respect those who are different from them,2
10555,89번,Abominable,7,This movie is great movie and the music is great  I also think the animation are also really good and it was also pretty funny at parts and the elemental powers are so cool   I really like the part where they are flying on clouds  I think anyone would like this,4
10556,89번,Abominable,7,the movie was amazing for kids but was a bit stupid,1
10557,89번,Abominable,7,Good family movie for 6  some of the characters are a bit meancruel so probably not best for children under 5 or 6,2
10558,89번,Abominable,7,This is one of da bess films from DreamWorks,1
10559,89번,Abominable,7,Abominable is a great interesting and funny movie My whole family loved it and the scenery is breathtaking  There is however a little bit of violence but that shouldnt stop you from watching it,3
10560,89번,Abominable,7,This movie is AWESOME I think this movie has a lot of teamwork and other stuff that makes it like the best movie in the worldbut some of this movie is scary and there are two very funny parts in this movie,2
10701,106번,Akeelah and the Bee,8,I was watching this movie with my family a couple weeks ago and just won my school spelling bee prior to writing this review  This movie and its protagonist were very encouraging and made me feel very good about myself and  what I can do  This movie was highly enjoyable for me and my family  This movie teaches and grows many important skills and strengths to have in life such as perseverance kindness practice friendly but intense competition sticking to anything you committed yourself to and more  This movie gets very intense towards the end and is the kind of intensity you wont take your eyes off the screen for until you find out what happens  Im not telling you what the twist is but all the characters are positive in a way and learn so much on their journey of preparing for spelling bees  Not every character is encouraging at first  though all grow in some way throughout the duration of the film  Its hard to create a movie that is this good and intense but still teaches so many good things to viewers without making the film so childish  My congratulations to Hollywood  I hope to watch this family friends perfect movie more than once in my life  Very appropriatetoo  Plus educational value,12
10702,106번,Akeelah and the Bee,8,This is a great family movie for all kids to enjoy  Exciting movie about determination and hard work,2
10703,106번,Akeelah and the Bee,8,This movie is very good I think that this is a really good movie for the family  One thing to be aware of is that there is some mild language but other than that its perfectly fine for kids 8 and up,3
10704,106번,Akeelah and the Bee,8,I think that it is really inspiring because Akeelah comes from a poor school that cant even afford bathroom stall doors  Also she gets a great coach which she has a lot in common with like they both lost someone important to them  Akeelah meets this boy Javier who helps her through the bee  Finally  I was really worried and it  almost made me cry out of happiness at the end,4
10705,106번,Akeelah and the Bee,8,This movie is absolutely great for the whole family  There is some references to death but otherwise it is fine  Also the mummom and Akeelah argue but the spelling parts of it are good,3
10706,106번,Akeelah and the Bee,8,This movie tells of a young girl from south Los Angeles going to a ghetto school and wining the national state spelling bee  expect ghetto talk aint dissing dawg yo whassup and more  there is also lots of cursing including St Dn A Hell bull St Btch and one mumbled mother Fcker  there is also references to weed cocaine and opium  there is also talk about sexually harassing people and to having sex there is also cheek kisses but no mouthed ones  kids are heard disrespecting teachers behind their backs too  and in one scene two ghetto girls confront Akeelah for being a braniac and a smart A Btch  the girls are seen pulling on Akeelah hair and hurting her  this move still tells how to be a good person and to learn who you are  I rate this,10
10707,106번,Akeelah and the Bee,8,Akeelah and the Bee has many positive messages and positive role models  This amazing movie contains very  mild language but other than that it is a spectacular film,2
10708,106번,Akeelah and the Bee,8,Thanks to Common Sense I learned about this movie among others and I loved it  It is a movie for everyone on the family  Great film,3

10782,108번,Aladdin,8,Great but kinda scary  I like it now being 9 but when I was 8 it was very intense and violent  Now I think otherwise  It is sweet still intense but overall good,4
10783,108번,Aladdin,8,The gini is very nice he is my favorite character in aladdin and on his 3rd wish he set the gini free,1
10784,108번,Aladdin,8,I really loved this movie  Some things I liked was Jasmines character although many people have already said that  I also appreciated the fact that although Aladdin was a thief he was more kindhearted from it  He only stole from those who he thought could provide for themselves good and those who were not kind to others  Not that stealing is good but a thief is part of his situation to live and I thought that this movie highlighted that  He got in trouble with the guards not because he stole something but was helping Jasmine not get caught  There was a lot of humor in this and I found myself laughing at many parts  I thought acting was really good and actors were well picked out  Nobody can beat Robin Williams but Will Smith does really good at following him,9
10785,108번,Aladdin,8,I really enjoyed watching this movie with my friends  They love it to  Jasmine is a great role model showing that girls can be great leaders and that their voice matters  It can be a little scary at times for younger kids  But overall I give it a 5 out of 5 stars  Great Movie D,6
10786,108번,Aladdin,8,Really loved the music in this movie  Funny and inspirational,2
10787,108번,Aladdin,8,Keeping in mind I have not watched the original yet I think this film is WONDERFUL  Great songs include Friend like me A whole new world and Speechless all of which have a very powerful message  Will Smiths performance as Genie was so funny  However there was lots of scariness especially in the final half mainly to do with Jafar  Another good thing is the huge amount of special effects  Overall great film,6
10788,108번,Aladdin,8,ALADDIN 2019 contains mild flirting and violence  Parents should know about the scariness,2
10789,108번,Aladdin,8,This is a stunning and breathtaking adaption of the animated film  It includes some kissing and iffy remarks some peril but otherwise this movie is a mustsee for all ages,2

10937,113번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,httpswww commonsensemedia orgusersdoggodess,1
10938,113번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,This movie was full off nightmarish images and a lot of analogies for drugs  It was terrifying and creepy  Literally my worst nightmare  This should be classified as a horror movie  DO NOT WATCH THIS,5
10939,113번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,Well this movie was    SUPER VIOLENT like very violent Im 11 and I had to look away at the gorey parts  I could handle it but I wish it was a little less scary  I think most 11 year olds can handle it but its going to be more enjoyable to a teen  There was also some uncomfortable parts with kissing and other romamce  It was magical and sometimes even funny but the creepy parts overrided the cool parts  Maybe if I was a teen I could explain the good parts more but it just was eek for me  Recommended for teens but not for kids Hope this was helpful,10
10940,113번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,First of all I love nearly every Burton movie Ive seen  I never really liked Alice in Wonderland but I was excited to see Burtons genius transmitted to the fantasy world of Wonderland,2
10941,113번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,I grew up with this live action Alice and find it potentially the most aesthetic film Ive ever seen  The storys a little wonky but I love the acting and general style  Not very violent but an animals eye is chopped out and anothers head is chopped off  I watch it mostly for the style but at its heart its my dearest Alice,4
10942,113번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,This is an awesome movie but its very creepy  Lots of fighting heads getting chopped off ect  They couldve just kept a playful fairy tale good then make it into this weird creepy stuff  It also might frighten younger kids with violence  I guess watching it one time is fine but after one time Im good  Not going to watch this again,6
10943,113번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,Alice is a good role model but the movie in general is just kind of boring  Some things may scare little kids  I liked Alice through the looking glass so much better,3
10944,113번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,Well dont get me wrong the classic version is amazing But so is this Im not usually a fan of Tim Burtons but I loved this movie Such a great twist but probably not for the younger age as it does have a bit of violence  But I loved it and I understand how people dont but in my opinion I think its awesome,5
10945,113번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,This movie totally ruined the story of Alice in wonderland for me  In this version Alice is too dull and isnt excited and curious like in the book or in the Disney movie  I just didnt like it  Plus Alice was supposed to be a little girl not a 20 year old or whatever,4
10946,113번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,the Disney classic is one of my favorite movies so I was really exited to see this one  but once I watched it I was really surprised how it wasnt even a remake  it was an adaptive sequel the jabberwocky is also TERRIFYING  this film should definitely not be viewed by anyone 13,4
12018,161번,Ant-Man,8,I personally enjoyed this movie  It was funny the plot was decent and thankfully for me and probably others there wasnt much in terms of sexual innuendos  There was some kissing and a comment related to this topic but overall it wasnt as bad as Iron Man,3
12019,161번,Ant-Man,8,Clever funny cool Marvel movie that has lots of scifi action,1
12020,161번,Ant-Man,8,A vary good movie  It is a superhero movie so theres a lot of violence but not intense and scary violence like the Batman  It shows a grate message of a past criminal in for robbery rehabilitating in the outside world well also being a superhero,3
12021,161번,Ant-Man,8,Antman is funny and a little violent  The violence is pretty standard for comic book violence and It never gets to gory  Some Language,3
12022,161번,Ant-Man,8,I watched Ant Man in theatres in Switzerland with my brother and my mom  Unlike most reviews here mines going to be unique yet hysterical  My mom kept on making snippy comments mainly she said the most dumbest things ever  When the main character Scott wanted to see his daughter his wife took him aside to explain all of the pay that men were pressured to do  The theatre was quiet as a mouse and my mom said out loud unrighteous btch  When Scott finally finds the AntMan suit and tries to put the helmet on my mom immediately said that was like from the movie Mask  Using the powers suit to shrink down to a small size Scott tries to escape the CGI effects of a tsunami in the bathtub  My mom immediately said that was in 3D  We normally watched the movie in 2D  With moms comments aside the movie is a must watch  There is not a lot of violence as in the other Marvel movies  The sequel to it is not bad  Recommend it to teens and adults 15,13
12023,161번,Ant-Man,8,I might be a bit biased considering this was the first PG13 and the first Marvel movie Ive ever watched but I loved this movie It has humor that was totally on my level  I wouldnt say it has too much swearing although there is an abundant use of language throughout  It doesnt have any gory fight scenes besides a short gunfight near the end  My sibling says that it is the mildest Marvel movie in the entire franchise  If youre looking to introduce your kid to Marvel movies I believe this would be the movie to start with,6
12024,161번,Ant-Man,8,Scott Lang an engineer who committed a crime he felt that was justified is sent to prison  When he gets out he wants to be on the straight and narrow for his daughter but having a record doesnt help  And his exwife refuses to let him see his daughter because he cant find a regular job  Eventually his friend tells him of a job and he decides to take it  Scott has to break into a vault and when he does all he finds is a weird suit  After he takes it he puts it on and discovers it shrinks him  Scott tries to return it and when he does hes arrested a man claiming to be his attorney goes to see him and he tells him that the suit was an opportunity which he should have taken  Later some ants bring him the suit and he puts it on and gets out of jail  He then goes to the man who says hes Hank Pym the man who created the suit  He used it before and called himself AntMan  He gave it up when he found out people were planning to use his technology for things he doesnt think is right so he made sure no one could replicate it and put it away  But he now needs Scott to be AntMan because it seems like his protg Darren Cross who forced him out of his company is close to replicating it  So he wants Scott to get into the lab and take it  Scott is uncertain if he can do it and Pyms daughter who thinks she should be the one to go agrees  But Pym thinks Scott is the one  So they train him while trying to make sure Cross doesnt suspect anything,16
12025,161번,Ant-Man,8,What I enjoyed about the movie is that it has a lot of action and fighting  I think characters are pretty cool  The story was nice  And I think its the best movie EVER,4
12031,161번,Ant-Man,7,Ant man is a great marvel movie for younger and older kids  There isnt to much violnce and you dont see anyone die but one person does get shot but lives  overall ant man was a really good movie for most ages and you should watch it,4
12032,161번,Ant-Man,7,Not even appropriate for adults  A man brags about touching a womans private part in one scene to name just one which I dont even think is PG13 content DO NOT WATCH,3
12033,161번,Ant-Man,7,Ant man is just a great movie and is quite family friendly,1
12034,161번,Ant-Man,7,Family friendly unless you consider people getting punched by a practically invisible shrunken ant man violent or bad  This movie is so good and I recommend it  It is no worse than guardians of the galaxy and it is similar to oceans 11  It does have bad words but I think that is the worst part about this movie  I watched it once one night and it was so good I watched the sequel and it a 2nd time the next morning,5
12035,161번,Ant-Man,7,I think its a really good movie for ages eight and up its really funny its definitely a movie Ill watch again,1
12036,161번,Ant-Man,7,AntMan is a great film  Its a pretty different Marvel film with a man who can turn into the size of an ant  It has many cool special effects especially when Scott turns small and has enough charm and action to appeal to many Marvel fans  The film also has a good and funny cast like Paul Rudd Michael Pea and Michael Douglas,4
12037,161번,Ant-Man,7,A funny one  With strong swearing and violent,2

12219,169번,Aquaman,8,I did not like it that much  I have to mention that there is a kissing scene I have watch the movie when it was released but I remember this scene lasted like a minute of two,2

12221,169번,Aquaman,8,Ugh I hated this movie  Just bad,2
12222,169번,Aquaman,8,it is only slightly violent and it has very harmless swear words,1
12223,169번,Aquaman,8,I found this movie quite good  There was quite a bit of violence especially when aqua man stabs the guy at the start  Maybe watch the movie with your kids because it is very good and has good message s and story line,3
12224,169번,Aquaman,8,A Must watch for everyone   It becomes clear that Jason Momoa is the perfect actor for Aquaman  Hes absolutely hilarious and I especially noticed the way that how the actor adapts to the various scenes environment  Really enjoyed the movie  Suitable for all ages,5
12225,169번,Aquaman,8,Dont mind that guy this movie is good better than the avengers movie  aquaman is a hero what do you expect  For it to be 1  because i watched this movie before and the trideint its so cool i almost forgot this movie because i like watched this movie like 2 years ago but nevermid that i wish i could give this movie 120005000099999  Stars and black manta he is that guy in the ship and  i dont know how he is in that suit but this movie is just so cool,3
12226,169번,Aquaman,8,doesnt really have anything bad in them just a little bit of violence  Sorta a cheesy movie though,2
12227,169번,Aquaman,8,At the beginning of the movie violence someone dies when black manga fights aquaman Aquaman gets very badly injured in a scary way that will scare young people and thats the only scene with blood and in the scene theres a lot of destruction  Finally when Aquaman and Aquamans wife get attack by creepyscary monsters the first couple monsters get killed by getting stabbed then more monsters come and  That will scare young viewers  Also theres way to much swearing for a superhero movie,4
12228,169번,Aquaman,8,all dc movies are very mediocre but this is one is almost at marvel qaulity,2
12229,169번,Aquaman,8,Aquaman was a pretty good movie  I had a lot of fun with it and I was rarely bored  Many fans of the DCEU will appreciate and be fond of this entertaining charming and witty undersea adventure  Most tweens will be relatively fine watching this movie  They may get a bit scared at some of the more disturbing scenes but the movie is pretty okay for them,5
12230,169번,Aquaman,8,very good movie but a bit violent  kids might find Black Manta creepy,2
12231,169번,Aquaman,8,I love how light hearted and fun some DCEU films have been because it being dark and grim most of the time isnt the greatest  The CGI is kind of wonky at times but it works for me  The action was fun and exciting  The plot isnt the greatest and sometimes the movie drags a lot more then I thought  While it is entertaining youll probably be glancing at your watch every now and then  The acting from Mamoa himself is definitely fantastic and he brings Aquaman man to life and making me look forward to the future of the DCEU  I would give Aquaman a 80100,7
12232,169번,Aquaman,8,I watched this as a prekid and I watched it alot of times  Yes there may be some innuendo or violence but it is all payed offworth it  I remember this movie and WATCHED IT AGAIN because why not,3
13825,211번,Barbie and the Secret Door,7,I give this an extra star because the mermaid didnt know what a boy was  meaning everyone is gay ,1
13826,211번,Barbie and the Secret Door,7,This show is very traumatising for children under the age of 18 it has some really cringe moments and can be very scary at times  and it is has way too much violence because the unicorns horns get ripped off sometimes the fairies wings this show is cruel to the unicorns,2
13827,211번,Barbie and the Secret Door,7,One of the best movies Ive ever seen appropriate for all ages in my opinion,1
13828,211번,Barbie and the Secret Door,7,It is very creative  I also think it is magical and funny   It has some cute creatures in it  It is different than most Barbie movies,4
13889,222번,Barbie Mariposa & the Fairy Princess,6,Loved the message the art style the writing and most of all I loved the chemistry between Mariposa and Katiana  I think Willa and Carlos might become something in the future but I mean PLEASE  Katiana showed Mari her favourite place gave Mari special gifts they went on adventures  now come on now  Im gonna ignore that the movie wanted us to believe that Carlos Mari are  made for eachother  Plus near the beginning of the movie mari even rolled her eyes when zee zee suggested the crush so     yeah 3 I happy,6
13890,222번,Barbie Mariposa & the Fairy Princess,6,Mariposa and the fairy princess is a good movie for kids 3 or higher  They set good role models of being nice and that the best way to make a friend is to be a friend,2
13984,229번,Batman vs. Robin,8,I think this movie was great but too much blood and gore especially when the villain took out the toy makers heart,1
13985,229번,Batman vs. Robin,8,Young and old rich and poor Batman geeks and normal people all will be disappointed at this DC Universe film,1
13986,229번,Batman vs. Robin,8,Ok sorry about my earlier review on this movie it was inaccurate  My mind has changed on several things  This movie is awesome and trying very hard to get several points across which youll have to figure out what its saying for yourself  This isnt a kids cartoon its a teen movie thats a morality tale ethical and esoteric in  many ways  I want you to watch this but only if youll understand it,5
13987,229번,Batman vs. Robin,8,I think that this movie is super violent there is a scene where a kid is getting punched by his dad and there is cruelty to animals when bruce wayne young shoots an arrow at an owl and kills it   And a guy gets his heart ripped out,2
13988,229번,Batman vs. Robin,8,My rating R for strong shockingdisturbing violence,1
14312,246번,Beetlejuice,8,it is michael keaton at his best,1
14313,246번,Beetlejuice,8,Its a reasonably good film though having seen Burtons other work I dont personally hold it in as high esteem as say Corpse Bride or Edward Scissorhands ,1
14314,246번,Beetlejuice,8,beetlejuice walks into a strip club  He walks in from the outside so we dont see inside the club at all   says a fword  some skeletons not scary,4
14315,246번,Beetlejuice,8,The only thing that got to me is beetlejuice saying Nice ing model and st but I say Dont show this to kids they will get foul mouthed,1
14316,246번,Beetlejuice,8,This is one of the weirdest WinnieThePoohRideatDisneyWorldlike Burtonist movies I have ever seen  I enjoyed the comedic presence of Beetleguse and wish he was in it for more of the movie and I thought all of the main actors were great  The story is just so weird I cant seem to love it,3
14317,246번,Beetlejuice,8,I think this is a great movie  But it is still best for older kids  Beetlejuice has a creepy look that can easily scare younger kids  Infrequent use of mild to moderate language except for 2 uses of fk includes the H word and one use of st  Because of the F and S words I think it shouldve gotten a PG13 rating since it was released late enough  But this is a really funny movie that I would recommend for Tim Burton and Halloween fans 11 and up,5
14318,246번,Beetlejuice,8,I watched this when I was around 6 so I didnt really understand what was going on but I do highly remember the fact that a ghost has a slit through someone has slit wrists and the rip their faces clean off  This isnt scary but if you have an easy to break stomach do not watch this,2
14319,246번,Beetlejuice,8,Has some swearing including the Fbomb and others  Not that scary in violence but some gore  Also a lot of smoking and drinking and some drugs,3
14320,246번,Beetlejuice,8,I wasnt allowed to watch this movie until last year I dont know what version this is but the version I watched was a 15,2
14321,246번,Beetlejuice,8,An epic family comedy for all to enjoy Its a fun movie with a hint of creepieness  And though there isnt much swearing when there is it is pretty bad and there is a scene where they find a ghost hung in a closet and it deffinently made me jump There are lots of people that have been graphically injured in some way but the way they look is only laughable  There is nothing that tweens cant laugh at and I think the official 15 rating makes no sense and I think that a 12 A or PG 13 for you Americans rating would make much more sense  Over all its a great family movie for all to enjoy,6
14486,257번,Benji,5,I remember watching this when i was younger and I really liked it mainly for its music though the scene where the kidnappers kill Benjis love interest is kinda violent for a Grated movie,1
14487,257번,Benji,5,We watched this movie  school and it was good UNTIL the girlfriend dog gets kicked  We did not get to watch the end so everybody thought the girlfriend dog died   Over all it was very cute  ,4
14488,257번,Benji,5,My 5 year old is pretty sensitive kid and we were caught offguard when there was a real gun firing when the children were kidnapped and gagged and when Benjis little sweetheart dog was kicked by a grownup   Of course my memories of it as a child were pretty benign but found it jolting to watch it with my little one   Were still stuck on Sound of Music and Singin in the Rain,3
14598,264번,Big Hero 6,6,Great animated comedy is fun for the family,1
14599,264번,Big Hero 6,6,I was 6 when I saw this and I was a diehard Elsa fangirl who wanted to see this movie because the trailer mentioned Frozen,1
14600,264번,Big Hero 6,6,I think Big Hero 6 is a good movie and it is ok for a 4 year old  It teaches about science and robotics  This movie is one of my favorite Disney movies and I recommend it for the whole family to watch,3
14601,264번,Big Hero 6,6,Big Hero 6 is a great family movie packed with the right amount of intensity and funniness  Having an amazing story line and characters but also containing some rather violent scenes  The Bad guy betrays the main characters Hero and his friends after his daughter to what seems gets lost in time   When at first being friendly character then later on in the movie at surprise scene his identity gets revealed after his mask comes off  These scenescontent possibly being a little intense for younger viewers  The main characters also getting beaten up quite frequently in those scenes not showing any blood or struggle pain scenes  Also the main characters older brother dying early on in a fire which could be hard on younger viewers as well  One PART TO DEFINITELY WATCH OUT FOR is when spoiler FYI Bay max technically sacrifices himself to save Hero and another character  This always tends to be quite sad even if you have watched the movie before  I was about 8 years old when I first watched this movie and was extremely sad  when scene occurred  Just saying I assume for most kids it would be sad in the moment then breeze by after but if your child takes things deeper  I would recommend watching the scene first before showing your child or bring some tissues  Overall being a fantastic movie almost guaranty you will enjoy this one no matter the age   Highly recommend this one,14
14602,264번,Big Hero 6,6,Although Hiros brother dies the rest of the movie is awesome I showed this to my 2 and 3 year old cousins and they loved it so much that they begged my aunty to watch it the next morning great family movie great  for kids of all ages,1
14603,264번,Big Hero 6,6,This movie is really good  Like really good  Stop what you are doing and WATCH IT,3
14604,264번,Big Hero 6,6,Funny educational great messages and role models no swearing may scare younger kids intense  violence,1
14605,264번,Big Hero 6,6,This is the second best kids action the ending is sad then becomes happy hope they make a second one,1
14606,264번,Big Hero 6,6,this movie is so good but a little sad but cool ,1
14897,269번,Billy Elliot,8,Great movie has strong language  A touching film  that clearly displays the life of an eleven year old boy fighting for his dreams amidst all the chaos of an 1980s miners strike  The film defies gender stereotypes and gives a message to kids and teens to just do what you love and dont let anyone the conditions youre in or the amount of money you have stop you,3
14898,269번,Billy Elliot,8,Fair about of fbombs but I think Its well worth it for the story,1
14899,269번,Billy Elliot,8,Billy elliot is bad  The language is not that bad with about 30 fwords   The violence is mild but a brief sight of blood could set sensitive people off  Some heated arguments  I actually thought there was a lot more sexual content than everyone said  I girl asks a boy if he wants to see her fanny vagina and they start kissing sensually,6
14900,269번,Billy Elliot,8,This is an amazing film with positive messages about sexuality homophobia and a lot of other things  I watched it with my paretspand my 10yearold brother  The scene with Debbie and Billy in the bedroom was pretty awkward Theres a lot of bad language in the film fk st ct I think fanny but kids swear more than adults anyway its not going to change anything  Im reviewing the full 15 version not the PG one,5
14901,269번,Billy Elliot,8,This movie was amazing to see  Beware of strong language however  This movie is about a young boy who wants to do ballet however his father is not ok with it  A very emotional movie,4
14902,269번,Billy Elliot,8,To much inappropriate comments and swearing,1
14903,269번,Billy Elliot,8,There is a lot of swearing but overall a great movie,1
14904,269번,Billy Elliot,8,Do not let your children watch this it is inappropriate And very stupid,2
14905,269번,Billy Elliot,8,I thought this was a really great movie An awesome roll model for kids growing up into teens  It also showed me that to never give up and try your hardest for the things you believe in or want   But there was a lot of swearing and a bit of violence so maybe not the best for younger or immature kids but overall it was an entertaining and often times hilarious movie that you orand your kids will LOVE,4
14906,269번,Billy Elliot,8,My ratingR for pervasive language some racy content,1
15142,279번,Black Panther,8,Went to the movies theater when it came out AMAZING MOVIE was my favorite movies till spiderman into the spider verse came outcheck out my review on that Mild violence one middle finger not recommended for small children great movie though,1
15143,279번,Black Panther,8,This is possibly the best Marvel movie so far  The action is awesome the story is great and the characters are interesting and diverse  Some of the violence may be too much for younger kids  There are a lot of shootings and deaths  Michael B  Jordans character is cruel and disturbing at times  12 and up,6
15144,279번,Black Panther,8,i realy like this movie you should let your kids watch this movie,1
15145,279번,Black Panther,8,This was not my favorite but its ok  There is some swearing but not much  It has a great storyboard and I think it is fine for a mature eight year old,3
15146,279번,Black Panther,8,THIS IS INCREDIBLE This movie is my perfect marvel movie  I love everything I love how this movie has so much emotion and is so powerful it will really tugs at the heartstrings  It has a perfect balance of action emotion plot everything in between  Most marvel movies have men characters but this movie has awesome women warrior characters my favorites are Shuri Okoye Nakia and let me just say Everyone  This is my all time favorite Marvel Movie Watch it,8
15147,279번,Black Panther,8,Message a teamwork and loyalty  The first black hero and a message on never giving up Fightingexplosions and even A death happen in the movie Stand Hell are said infrequently  No Real sex in this movie  Its Part of the marvel cinematic universe Some Drinking in one scene,3
15148,279번,Black Panther,8,Great film  Favorite Marvel film so far,2
15149,279번,Black Panther,8,This movie is one of the best I have ever watched in my life but it did use consumerism violence and swearing  Though it had these it conveyed great messages and inspired us to support everyone no matter their background  It did not use sex or drugdrinkingsmoking but I would still recommend watching it with a parent or a group of friends  But if you are  8 and understand certain words are bad then I think you could still watch it,4
15150,279번,Black Panther,8,This is a really good movies for families There are a couple violent scenes and SPOILER the guy who tries to take over Wakanda is a little creepy with the knifescarthing on his upper body      but a good movie for celebrating black families Another thing a VERY good movie to watch right now especially with COVID and the BLACK LIVES MATTER thing  Great family movie definitly would watch again and probaly will,4
15161,279번,Black Panther,6,TOO MUCH VIOLENCE  FOR KIDS,2
15162,279번,Black Panther,6,this is a good movie I recommend this,1
15163,279번,Black Panther,6,I thought that this movie was good but kids under 13 might have a hard time following it understanding it  Also the violence was really intense  But I thought that it had good messages and role models,3
15164,279번,Black Panther,6,It has swearing and Blood and the religion might be confusing for Kids,1
15165,279번,Black Panther,6,i think this movie is great its just kinda violent thats all,1
15166,279번,Black Panther,6,This movie will be good to take an 10 year old out to see a movie but mild language is my concern,1
15167,279번,Black Panther,6,This movie gives info about the strength of black people everybody knows that black panther represents the strength of black people and it just says damn hell sht and other BUT its great  At the end of the movie tchalla and nakia kiss  but its not to sexual  and the movie puts out great messages,4
15168,279번,Black Panther,6,well there is quite a lot of violence characters get stabbed multiple times murder as punishment etc remind your kid or teen that this is just acting and special effects  Also there is some positivity in it  It has a message that no matter what race you are you can still do many great things  but one part I didnt like was that two characters kiss at the end  blah   There is a minimal amount of swearing  I grew up around swear words and such so if you dont want your kidteen hearing that I recommend not watching this with youre kidteen  I hope this review helped you in some way,7
15197,279번,Black Panther,8,Ive seen marvel movies better than thissuch as Thor  Although it is good it has some violent scene  Rude moments suggestive and blood is seen  I think this is better than Doctor Strange but this is still a boring MARVEL movie  Kids should not see this movie by it self,5
15198,279번,Black Panther,8,This movie is awesome action packed and gets you on the edge of your seat  Quite violent though,2
15199,279번,Black Panther,8,Black Panther is a beautiful movie with an excellent storyline and positive role models  It really values the importance of culture and diversity and supports equality for all females and males,2
15200,279번,Black Panther,8,it is very good and full of action,1
15201,279번,Black Panther,8,This is a great movie There is a lot of violence  But there is no blood  There is lots of positive messages too   I think this is appropriate for tweens,5
15202,279번,Black Panther,8,Amazing film with fun drama and superhero action,1
15203,279번,Black Panther,8,Fine movie  Watched like a million times  Knowing marvel movies this ones on the more graphic violent side but its not the worst  There are several scenes of bloody punching and stabbing and one seen of aman laying on the ground and is shot  Nothing sexual,5
15204,279번,Black Panther,8,It was a great movie that includes action adventure and story  A good movie about culture May be intense for younger children,2
15810,299번,Bolt,8,Superdog adventure is fun and ageappropriate for kids,1
15811,299번,Bolt,8,This movie shouldnt be watched by any kid under 6 for the violent scene at the end with Penny and Bolt  That one scene influenced the whole movie to be PG for me  If your undersixyearold kid loves action or suspence then this is the movie for them  If not dont hesitate to ignore,4
15812,299번,Bolt,8,Explosions galore in funny witty actioner,1
15813,299번,Bolt,8,I thought this film was awesome when it first came out  Since I was a kid who loved dogs and superheroes it was basically everything I could ask for  Now that Im older I dont like it quite as much as I used to  The violence is alright for kids there is no swearing and basically zero sexuality  Its also got heart humor and engaging action  Its certainly something entertaining for the younguns  continue for more detail,7
15814,299번,Bolt,8,This is a really good movie with lots of fun action  the main scary type bit is towards the end with the treat of the fire,2
15815,299번,Bolt,8,Its kinda a baby movie but otherwise its fine,1
15816,299번,Bolt,8,BOLT is full of good jokes and lots of fast action I especially loved the hamster in his clear ball running around and being brave and silly,2
15817,299번,Bolt,8,it is a bit scary,1
15818,299번,Bolt,8,I dont love this movie  It is kind of bland for a family movie  Pick something else,3
15819,299번,Bolt,8,Great movie I think  Will be nice if it was less violent,2
16030,307번,Boy and the World,7,I think this movie was okay I also think that it should be for 7 because there were some sad parts like when there was a war between the people who wanted to protect the environment and people who wanted to take down the environment and replace it with houses and big companies,1
16169,318번,Brave,8,An interesting movie with an empowering message  Its a grate story but it might be a bit too violent for younger children  The reason I rated it 11 is not because it had too much violence in it but because it have a very complex meaning hidden in it  It was even complex for me If you really want to enjoy it you have to understand it  Overall a great story with a great message,6
16170,318번,Brave,8,This movie is a really good one to skip especially for sensitive kids,1
16171,318번,Brave,8,Ive seen Frozen 2 and Wreck it Ralph Breaks the Internet both pale in comparison to the awfulness of this movie,1
16172,318번,Brave,8,i love this movie  such great role models music and animations  It also embodies the importance of family relationships  great movie,4
16173,318번,Brave,8,I would almost put this under a mild horror movie label and a family film at the same time  I guess it just depends on how tough your kids are with animated violence and creepiness since there are scenes I felt were a bit much for younger kids  SPOILER ALERT For example when Meridas mother turns into a bear and when she wasnt acting like her human self at times  The witch her magic and her cottage was also creepy  Another bear  who looked rotted and beaten  from an ancient story was also shown trying to kill Merida and her family  It really depends on what kind of kid you have I guess,6
16174,318번,Brave,8,I finished this movie tonight and it rules My mom said shed watch this movie over again I used to be scared but now Im not  I took a quiz on ohmy disney com and apparently Im a cross of Merida and Belle,4
16175,318번,Brave,8,Great movie  Theres a great message  But theres some mild violence and scariness  There is no bloodshed or guns but it is definitely scary for kids under the age of 7,4
16176,318번,Brave,8,This film was traumatic for 4 year old me  Children at that age arent really able to comprehend whats happening and just see people turning into bears and trying to kill each other  However when watched at the right age its a great film with a good role model and comedic at times,3
16177,318번,Brave,8,scary a little  good movie  very sad,3
16204,318번,Brave,8,This movie is not good,1
16205,318번,Brave,8,Not pixars best  Pretty scary movie as well,2
16206,318번,Brave,8,It has a great plot The characters are awesome and I LOVE how it takes place in Scotland They use traditional Scottish music in in the movie and I absolutely LOVE their accents You should watch this movie I shows the traditions of Scotland too,6
16207,318번,Brave,8,It is a good movie but it is too scary for younger kids,1
16208,318번,Brave,8,i really like the movie brave and there are some parts that are scary and the tiniest bit inappropriate  the main character Merida and her mother go on an adventure to turn mom back into a human instead of a,2
16209,318번,Brave,8,This movie was much better than many people thought it was in my opinion   It was one of the first movies I saw at the movie theater and I enjoyed it a whole lot,2
16210,318번,Brave,8,i love this,1
16211,318번,Brave,8,This shows that even girls can be strong  This is about family and is a MUST for family movie nights,2
16212,318번,Brave,8,Because this movie is produced by Pixar its a lot better than any Disney Princess movie  The main character is strong and independent and an awesome role model  Unlike Disney movies there is no romance crap in the film  Plot is exciting and action filled the musical score is beautiful and overall great movie,4
16213,318번,Brave,8,My ratingPG13 for intense sequences of fantasy violence and disturbing sequences of action,1
16234,318번,Brave,7,Come on my 7 year old sister loved it she watched every Harry Potter too now she is 8  It is not scary I was laughing,2
16235,318번,Brave,7,Good movie  There is some violence with Meridas mom turning into a bear  Also a big demon bear is the scariest part  It comes and attacks the characters in three scenes  Positive messages Follow your heart and dont let others control you  Educational with learning about Scotland life in medieval times,6
16236,318번,Brave,7,Has mild scary scenes and a bear attack but in all has a good message about family,1
16237,318번,Brave,7,Hello This is my review on Brave  I will be telling the story also if I liked it or not  Hope this helps,4
16238,318번,Brave,7,Produced by Pixar and released by Walt Disney Pictures Brave is a story about a motherdaughter relationship  I have to admit that when we watched it in the cinema it was a little scary and there were some violence and some inappropriate content for young children therefore I think it is suitable for children ages at least 8  above but other than that it is a good movie with a strong and positive moral,2
16239,318번,Brave,7,I was nine years old when I saw this movie with my parents in the threatens in 3d and I almost had nightmares literally the scary bear action gave me the heebie newbies and I was scared of elinors bear transformation  And I even almost cried at the end of the movie overall it was good but it would scare some kids  Note not for little children,3
16240,318번,Brave,7,This is a very action packed Pixar film  I love the graphics the animation and just everything,2
16241,318번,Brave,7,Lots of violence and inappropriate scenes  Also I found that the movie gets a little boring near the end,2
16242,318번,Brave,7,i havent seen it and dont want to since a lot of pixar fans said it wasnt  all that good,1
16243,318번,Brave,7,I am 7 years old and I love this movie   But it was a little scary because of the scary bear   But over all I liked it a lot,3
17429,360번,Cars 2,3,anyone who is saying this is a bad movie and not for kids is DEAD WRONG  My brother is 6 YEARS OLD and he absolutely adored it it not only shows very good graphics and was well put together but it ALSO shows that nothing should get in the way of friendship  there was absolutely NO extreme violence NO cars being Tortured NO glorifying guns and NO UPFRONT DEATH sure it implies in the beginning that they found an agent and squashed him and yes HE died if thats what even happens to cars but no one under the age of 7 could possibly understand what happened in that scene Honestly from seeing the commercials i thought itd be a horrible movie but it was great I was surprised theres nothing that could be considered real violence unless you count missiles that are poorly aimed and simply shake them in the opposite direction violence  i dont understand what people are saying about it being not for kids  i mean sure theirs some adult humor but children dont understand it and its for the purpose of making the movie fun for EVERYONE Come on sure it has some intense scenes but unless you parents TELL your 47 year old Oh their about to die that things gonna crush them  Oh look they lied  Oh look he did something stupid  then they arent gonna say a THING  in fact they just might like it so parents dont influence your childs view on movies just because you think its inappropriate  let them make up their minds  Im here to tell you just because a person writes a long review doesnt mean that thats what youre going to think of the movie see for yourself,18
17430,360번,Cars 2,3,Cars 2 does deserve a PG rating based on the violence but I have no clue what made all the other reviewers deside that kids should not see this movie   Even though there is a scene of what I consider torture to a car and cars motors being overheated that does not make a movie horrible it makes it innappropriate   Cars 2 in my opinion was an excellent film and I reccomend it to families but be prepared for some violence   I will agree that it does seem like a tamed James Bond movie but overall a hilarious great Pixar film,4
17431,360번,Cars 2,3,Great for 710 year olds who want to see movies with violence,1
17432,360번,Cars 2,3,I think this movie wasnt a true creation of PIXAR I read the reviews on here and I see everyone hating this movie and calling it the The first terrible PIXAR movie  Yes it is more violent and the story is confusingin my opinion But this probably isnt PIXARS fault  My theory is that Disney maybe rushed PIXAR into making this movie since the recent gross revenue of Toy Story 3 was over 1 billion and became one of the most successful kids movies of the decade  Which possibly means Disney wants PIXAR to make sequels of their successful movies because they think that will make them more money so what ruined PIXAR you ask It was probably money,5
17433,360번,Cars 2,3,HAAHAHA Great for kids any age  Take my word for it This movie is so funny It is a suggestion and recommendation,5
17434,360번,Cars 2,3,i think that Cars 2 is an absoletly a good movie for every age to see and it is very funny so i think you should watch it with anyone,1
17435,360번,Cars 2,3,I was honestly dissapointed with the secod movie of the orignal cars  Cars the original was funny and a great family movie  But i was shocked at all the gun fights and killing of cars in this movie  And it wasnt as funny enjoyable and definetly not as kid friendly as the first     Bottom line very dissapointing this movie should have a PG rateing,4
17436,360번,Cars 2,3,I took my 4 year old son to watch Cars 2 over the weekend  It was his first movie theater experience and we have been counting down the days for months for this movie to come out  Unfortunately I was really disappointed by how much violence and inappropriate banter and language there was within the film  My son plugged his ears throughout various fighting scenes and was very aware that Lightning McQueen was trying to get killed in the movie  I am stunned that this movie is rated G  Honestly if I had known there was so much violence in the film I would have passed  Sadly this feature is NOTHING like the first Cars  So disappointed,7
17437,360번,Cars 2,3,You see I think some parents are exaggerating about the violence although there is a lot my older sister and I were a little shocked when we found out some cars were actully killed,1
17438,360번,Cars 2,3,Honestly we took our three year old to see this and it was not appropriate in the least   In fact my child tried to emulate the gun violence immediately when we got home      and this was a new behavior for him   Its as if the movie explicitly taught him how to do it     not that he wouldnt have learned it at some other point but little did I know he was learn it today,3
17491,361번,Cars 3,8,Cars 3 wasnt bad but it definitely did not meet Pixars high standards   The script was weak and there was nothing memorable at all   It will entertain your kids however and there is never a dull moment   There is zero bad language and no violence   But Cars 3 is flatout disappointment,5
17492,361번,Cars 3,8,I loved this movie   I think it is the of the three Cars series  I like this film the best because this isnt the average Disney  Pixar movie  This is a movie for the whole family  To prove it my brother is two and he sat through this whole movie and he loved it  I like how now Lightning McQueen is getting older  As I was watching I felt like the little kid again watching the first Cars movie  This fun family comedy is about new and improved race cars and they get faster than one of my all time favorite characters Lightning McQueen  Lightning gets into a crash  This leads Lightning McQueen to get a trainer  This leads to trouble  I was surprised this film was so good  considering how bad the second movie Cars 2 was   The reason I think this film is OK for kids six and up is because there are some intense crashes and Lightning McQueen said  Lifes a beach  Overall I recommend this movie to any family or any car loving kid,14
17493,361번,Cars 3,8,Wow cars 3 is actually a good film  Its better than cars 2 which wasnt good in my opinion  This movie is perfect for kids 4 and up  Theres no bad language or name calling lifes is a beach and then you drive  is said by lightning though lol Young  Kids wont get it,6
17494,361번,Cars 3,8,I think Cars 3 is an awesome  It teaches kids to believe in yourself and that males and females are equal  I recommend this movie for kids 7 and up and its a must see for fans of the Cars franchise,3
17495,361번,Cars 3,8,It was a great story the new car Storm and the great old Litning McQueen,1
17496,361번,Cars 3,8,For the third movie of this sofartrilogy this was great In my opinion theres nothing much to be cautious about except for the devistating and dramatic crash in,2
17497,361번,Cars 3,8,I understand this movie was  made to show girls they can do whatever they want to  my self as a girl who dreams of racing this movie honestly made me cry for an hour straight  It was so heart touching and amazing  but the ending broke me into pieces  end of a day its a kids movie you expect a happy for lightning to win and all the glory to be his  but no,2
17498,361번,Cars 3,8,I loved the movie but I have one issue  No kachow was said and Im not impressed at all,2
17499,361번,Cars 3,8,This movie was absolutely fantastic It kept you on the edge of your seat all while having comical relief too  It maintained the storyline very well  The only thing I didnt like about it was the ending    When you wait all that time to see lighting McQueen race and win the race and then he doesnt even finish the race its REALLY disappointing  I believe that he shouldve finished that race and then gone into being the crew chief  Cars was the first movie I ever watched as a kid and this movie really broke my heart It crushed all the life out of me,8
17757,365번,Casino Royale (2006),8,The first of the Daniel Craig bond series is no doubt the best one as well  This film is about James Bond who has recently been promoted to 007  status has been sent on a mission to stop a terrorist organisation from getting 100s of millions of pounds  I rated this film 13 because it has lots of graphic violence dark themes and a shocking torture scene  It also has a sex scene where nothing is shown but it has lots of kissing,4
17758,365번,Casino Royale (2006),8,Good movie awesome figt scene really talented actors would recommend for kids 13 and up,1
17759,365번,Casino Royale (2006),8,Its a good film but theres lots of violence and sex   The card game is thrilling and action scenes are great   Wait till you kids get older but they HAVE TO see this film,3
17760,365번,Casino Royale (2006),8,A classic bond film with several heart stopping moments and there are several moments that leave you asking How did he do this out of great acting and an even better plot line  With a few twists and turns on the way this film will not let you dont  It met all expectations,4
17761,365번,Casino Royale (2006),8,This is my personal favorite movie  Honestly it is the closest to a perfect film I have ever seen,2
17762,365번,Casino Royale (2006),8,jeepers i have never seen a film so violent  there is a torture scene that is so brutal  there are so many violent scenes like bond throwing people down stairs killing eachother in very brutal ways,3
17763,365번,Casino Royale (2006),8,It is a good film but has more violence than the other Daniel Craig films  A man gets drowned in a sink  James Bond gets tortured in a torture chamber  There is a fight on a stair case with knifes  There is a 2 minute scene of Bond strangling a man on the floor  Plenty of blood and gore  Lots of gunshots and stabbing  Some bad language and lots of sexual scenes  When bond kisses a girl topless for about three minutes and kisses more then this is the most sexual one by far  Also a Lady gets drowned in a cage,10
17764,365번,Casino Royale (2006),8,This is my absolute favorite film in the James Bond franchise and in general  The plot line is unparalleled and extraordinarily intriguing  I would highly recommend watching it is truly a fantastic film,3
17765,365번,Casino Royale (2006),8,An ok bond movie,1

17767,365번,Casino Royale (2006),8,Casino Royale is my all time favorite James Bond movie and Ive seen all 26 This movie follows the book by Ian Flemming much more closely than the original movie  Plus Daniel Craig is absolutely amazing,3
17768,365번,Casino Royale (2006),8,My ratingPG13 for violencesexualitynuditytorture and drug use,1
17769,365번,Casino Royale (2006),8,I saw this with my sisters and it was amazing  Im a die hard bond fan  I loved every minute of it My favorite character was Vesper Lynd  I think its a great movie for all famlies,5
17770,365번,Casino Royale (2006),8,I know  This is a James Bond movie many people around here are not allowed to see them but surprisingly Martin Campbell does one heck of a rare thrilling job  A ton better than Skyfall it moves the James Bond genre to something like a Superhero movies while still keeping physics in mind,3
17771,365번,Casino Royale (2006),8,This movie was good but there was not enough action and even I 12  years old  didnt even understand this movie   A kid who is under 1213 years old shouldnt see this movie  Its hard to understand the concept of this movie  The rule James Bond had was to trust no one There is also blood dripping down Bonds face and strong body,5
17772,365번,Casino Royale (2006),8,This was one of the first Bond movies I saw and I loved it  Having that said keep in mind that we are talking about a James Bond movie this meaning that there are scenes of nudity violence drugs gambling and foul language  This movie is most certainly not suitable for children under 12,3
17773,365번,Casino Royale (2006),8,My ratingR for graphic violencegraphic racy contentand brief strong language,1
17867,367번,Castle in the Sky,8,I had seen the movie a couple times previous but recently showed it to my younger sisters 4 and 6 who absolutely loved it There is some violence including a scene where the male lead Pazu gets pistolwhipped but I wouldnt say it was enough to steer you off the movie  The younger of the two had a bit of an issue when they were having difficulties saving Sheeta but again It wasnt that big of a deal  And after assuring her that the girl would be ok she calmed down  Both the male and female leads are strong and have great character development especially Sheeta who learns to have faith in herself and her strength which I think is a great message for kids to learn,5
17868,367번,Castle in the Sky,8,I watched this last night with my 6 year old sister and she was a bit frightened in the battle scenes but she was fine after that  This has been my favourite film since I was 8  I cried half the way through not because it was sad but because it is so well written  If your kids arent scared by a bit of violence then this is perfect to introduce them to studio Ghilbi,4
17869,367번,Castle in the Sky,8,If youre looking for an excuse to get back into watching Studio Ghibli movies search no further,2
17870,367번,Castle in the Sky,8,Castle in the Sky is the perfect international adventure film It is very violent because one of the main characters almost gets shot and its a 9 year old so please be aware of that and Studio Ghibil is the perfect way to introduce anime to kids and I love the movie please go watch it,2
17871,367번,Castle in the Sky,8,Im going to just say what concerned caregivers should know as to not give anything away  This is a cute and wonderful movie  However it is violent and you should know the kid you want to show it to  This movie can be suitable for much younger audiences than 8 but it does contain guns and explosions  No one dies or is injured understand that the violence relates only to the weapons  So be sure that the kid can handle a little excitement,6
17872,367번,Castle in the Sky,8,Although I loved this movie I think that it does take a while to get really good but it is totally worth watching the whole 2 hour movie to see the ending  Also its surpisingly really violent,2
17873,367번,Castle in the Sky,8,This movie is awesome I almost have no words for it My hole family and me  watched it yesterday until 10 pm and we all loved it Its an awesome movie a great message and roll model  The only thing there is is guns and shooting but its not really scary my family watched it and my brother watched it and hes 6  There is a tiny bit of violence from the guns but its a great animated movie,6
17874,367번,Castle in the Sky,8,a great well formed movie for those wanting to start studio ghibli  good for families with positive messages for all  has little racial representation,3
17875,367번,Castle in the Sky,8,I think the  movie was the best I have ever seen I loved all the battle scenes,1
17876,367번,Castle in the Sky,8,i think its a wonderfull movie i mean you can float in the sky with that necklesss i think its magical fun but aliitle of violence like when muska,1
18153,376번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,The incidents in this movie are CooCoo Do not see this movie,3
18154,376번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,I thought that this film was very sweet and very bright to its source material with a couple of surprises of its own  The performances by the younger kids was just right the direction was superb the visuals were so mystical and the storyline was just right to the classic book itself  The only criticism I have of this movie is that Johnny Depps performance as Willy Wonka was not one of his best performances I have seen with him  He doesnt make a compelling and mysterious Willy Wonka his character is meanspirited he looks like half Shirley Temple and half Carol Burnett and he looks like a woman  Overall I thought that this film was very exhilarating and true to its purpose and source material of the book and that it will entertain many people of any age  Kids and 8 year olds are meant to see this movie if they are fans of the book and 1971 movie version and even adults can see this movie as well for its imagination and fun purpose  Younger kids under 8 years old are probably not meant to see this movie for its quirky situations action and mild language,7
18155,376번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,Theres no option for too much horror but if there was thats what this would have  Its not actually scary but for a 3 year old its creepy  A boy is sucked up a tube and taken away a girl turns blue and becomes a huge blueberry and is rolled away a girl is pushed down a shoot to an incenerator and a boy is shrunk to microscopic size  All the kids survive however  One use of retard is the worst language youll hear nothing else really  Just keep in mind its a dark Tim Burton movie,6
18156,376번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,alluring fun and sweet movie overtelling the classic tale  staring the outstanding Johnny Depp  a must watch for the whole family  eat chocolate and let yourself relax in a swirl of candy while watching Charlie and the chocolate factory,4
18157,376번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,It might not surpass the original but it was still great  The acting well done,2
18158,376번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,started to like it got bored of it after the 8th time,1
18159,376번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,First time I watched this movie I liked it but since I watched this movie so many times its not that great anymore,1
18160,376번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,It is a really good movie It has good educational value because it tells you not to be greedy  The actors do really good jobs  I also really like Johnny Depp he is really funny ,3
18161,376번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,Great film for all the family  However some scenes of moderate peril could be upsetting or distressing to younger children  Carries a very strong positive message that should be shared,3
18162,376번,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005),8,good,1
18498,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,Brutall treatments   I suggest kids watch under 8 with an adult  This has some sex couple kisses and aloving couple getting married  The stepmother is very cruel and it could offend young ones,4
18499,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,The film is great It has all the original characters including Ella the stepsisters Drizella and Anastasia Lady Tremaine the stepmother and Prince Kit  This version of the story is a lot more detailed than the original though  It shows Ellas childhood plus the death of her parents which was pretty sad  The death of Ellas Mom was especially sad because she fell ill and it showed the scene when she died  Anyways the movie is great especially if you grew up watching the original or always wanted more details  I recommend this as a great family film,6
18500,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,I know a lot of you want a flashy entertaining movie but something can be said for just a well done retelling  Its okay to change the plot slightly but I do not understand why so many movies ruin the morels of each story  This movie stays faithful to the morals and truth of Cinderella  This is a very well done movie  Excellent job,5
18501,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,This take on classic tale is told in many ways but this remake is something else  Its beautifulstunningand its the type of movie that everyone can laughcryand enjoy together,2
18502,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,I think this movie is better than the original animated Cinderella film because it is much more exciting and has more depth even though it is scarier and more mature for younger kids  Its really entertaining and great for Disney fans,2
18503,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,Courageous and Kind Ella whose parents had recently pass away lived the life of a servant under the rule of her cruel step mother   The heroine now called Cinderella because of the cinder and ash she slept near was played by Lily James   The evil stepmother was played by Academy Award Winner Cate Blanchett and the dashing and handsome prince was played by Richard Madden   Cinderella released in 2015 is a live adaptation of the Disney animated classic by acclaimed director Kenneth Branagh   This fairy tale based in a land far far away with a gorgeous countryside and colorful characters was a beautiful film to watch,6
18504,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,Beautiful adaption of a timeless classic perfect for your  little princes and princesses 12 and this is one of my favourite movies The dresses made by Sandy Powell could not be more gorgeous and though this adaptation lacks the unforgettable musical score from the 1950 original you will still be stunned at what a beautiful emotional movie Disney has made Also not forgetting the cast that may appeal to older viewers including Richard Madden AKA Robb Stark from Game of Thrones as Prince Kit Charming Lily James AKA Lady Rose from Downton Abbey which highly pleased my mother as Cinderella Cate Blanchett AKA Elizabeth from the movie of the same name as Lady Tremainethe stepmother and Helena Bonham Carter AKA Bellatrix from Harry Potter as Fairy Godmother You NEED to see this movie as it is one of the most beautiful films ever made for kids and adults I give Cinderella 55 stars and say its ok for kids ages 5,6
18505,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,I feel like this adaptation didnt live up to the original movie at all  I felt like it was all too dramatic in the end  Sure Id watch it with someone else if they wanted me too but never alone  Not that its scary I just dont like that they felt the need to make this more dark  If your kids are expecting the lighthearted cheer that the cartoon had skip this one,5
18506,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,Okay movie but too much like the old fairy tale   Not very exciting   The main characters were too perfect they were always doing only the right thing and being too nice,3
18507,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,It had really good actors but it was boring because you already know the plot and everything it practically had nothing scary there isnt much to say about it,1
18516,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,It was a waste of money to make such a movie  Bad actors that cannot cry or even pretend to be sad  A big disappointment  Children need new stories and not Cinderella 100,4
18517,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,Love everything in the movie Nothing wrong with the movie,2
18518,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,This movie made me cry  Best Movie Ever,2
18519,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,I loved this film  Im a Disney freak and seeing Cinderella come to life in a liveaction movie excited me so say the least   I was a little put off by the new portrayal of the fairy godmother but otherwise I was oohing and aahing over that beautiful dress  Lady Tremaine was brillant too,4
18520,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,A magical stunning beautiful gorgeous looking retelling of a great fairy tale  Lily James and Richard Madden were excellent as the titular characters  Cate Blanchett was excellent as well  Kids will love it  Grade A,5
18521,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,Like the original story Cinderella plays out slowly with less romance than you want  But compared to Maleficent this film was a pretty decent remake  It had well casted actors and beautiful scenery  However young girls may feel intimidated by Cinderellas personality   Talk with your kids about how girls should stand up for themselves  Also the actress playing Cinderella is very skinny  I would not recommend this film to very young girls,7
18522,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,Not for kids 15  under,1
18523,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,Great movie All ages Loved it,3
18524,398번,Cinderella (2015),8,My ratingG,1
19047,423번,Coco,6,The best,1
19048,423번,Coco,6,This movie was really good  Its probably one of my favorite marvel movies  I recommend this movie,3
19049,423번,Coco,6,So good it made me cry,1
19050,423번,Coco,6,I remember watching this back in late 2017 to early 2018,1
19051,423번,Coco,6,If you still have encanto fever try watching this  it might be fine for a mature 6 year old but i recommend 7 pretty much the reason why is because younger kids 4 to 6 years old may be scared of some things like the images and death it also has murder from posion and murder from pushing off heights nongraphic no blood and no injurys shown for both the boy who was pushed also was saved before he hit the ground in it skeletons ect  mild crude humor that kids may not get but it has pretty good representation as it has tons of mexican culture,3
19052,423번,Coco,6,I dont mind this movie but I did find it quite boring  The storyline was great though  I dont understand why people find this scary but it really isnt and I feel they are just being dramatic,3
19053,423번,Coco,6,Beautiful  Great representation of Mexican culture and so much time and effort put into the art  I love it and am having so much trouble why some people think its scary because of skeletons,3
19633,436번,Coraline,8,My sister had first showed me this film when I was 7 I was terrified and it caused my phobia of buttons to increase and get worse by a lot  It is a creepy film and I personally dont recommend anyone under 10 to watch it  It has a dark storyline and I didnt enjoy it  I appreciate that not everyone has a phobia of buttons but I still believe anyone under 10 should definitely beware,4
19634,436번,Coraline,8,My brother saw this alone at night when he was 6 and it terrified him  I saw it when I was 7 and  I thought it was scary but not too much  Me and my brother each love the movie  The stop animation effect is great and its always exciting We watch it together all the time now and we still love it  I think that you can see it when you are 7 but it will still be pretty scary,6
19635,436번,Coraline,8,Good for ages  and up but has some moments were might scae young children,1
19636,436번,Coraline,8,Coraline is kind of like a horror film for younger children  I was around 7 when I first watched Coraline and I was kind of scared at the time however watchiing a horror film made me feel cool and grownup which is one of the reasons I think that kids enjoy it  Theres many scary scenes in the film but nothing that is extremely disturbing  A woman in the film tries to persuade a young girl to sew button into her eyes which is incredibly creepy  The part that scared me the most and still does now sometimes is the end when a girl is being chased  by this spider like human Im not trying to go into detail because of spoilers   A part that may make parents feel slightly uncomfortable is a scene where  two old women are almost naked its for comedy not anything sexual while they are on a trapeze  f youre children are sensitive and are not used to violence and disturbing content then this is not the best thing to show them,7
19637,436번,Coraline,8,I think this movie is fine for 10 year olds and up  I watched it at the age I am now 9 in 2017 and it gave me a good scare but I think 1982s Poltergeist is way creepier than this  This film does have a killer mom than wants to sew buttons into Coralines eyes but if youve watched the Goosebumps movie The Haunting Hour TV show and Beetlejuice then youre definitely fine with this  By the way I slept in my bedroom on my own with only two lights on and I didnt have any nightmares,4
19638,436번,Coraline,8,Well its all about a monster who lures children away from their parents and tricks them into having buttons sewn into their eyes so it definitely deserves a pg13 rating but other than that its a really good movie about how you really never appreciate something enough until its gone  it is dark and disturbing and the animation somehow makes it a lot scarier,2
19639,436번,Coraline,8,Okay Im kind of a freak and have always been kind of abnormal but I freaking loved this movie when I was 5  Yeah its creepy but thats what makes it fun and it certainly will challenge a kid more than squeakyclean trash we shove down the throats of our fellow young uns  Though if your kid is a little wussI mean is more sensitive take some precautions and watch some clips first  And about the naked woman pasties partGrow up  No kid thinks its a big deal its a joke and its a suit  Not to mention the naked body is everywhere at home in art etc so is it that big of a problem,6
19640,436번,Coraline,8,Good film well animated  But scary for younger audiences  Not for sensitive children parents should watch first to be certain,3
19641,436번,Coraline,8,In this movie the parents do not help or care about the child  This might make a child think that it is common and feel scared that this might happen to them   I watched this at school sadly  My teacher gave this movie to watch and my mom would have never approved such movie  I do not see that there are important lessons or even a role model that a child like me should look up to  Another disturbing part was the button eyes  I think it is very frightening for a child to see instead of eyes buttons  My friend had nightmares after watched the movie,8
19642,436번,Coraline,8,To be honest I dont know why this movie was a PG  Even I found this scary and i hardly find ANYTHING scary  It is such a horrible idea  People with button eyes Thats bad enough  Your parents with button eyes  WOW,7
19670,436번,Coraline,7,It was very creepy and the actors were not very good  Some parts were funny like those two crazy lady but others were creepy or boring,2
19671,436번,Coraline,7,Coraline is a great movie  Although it may look like a kid friendly movie Im warning you its not what it seems  The movie is not only scary but actually very creepy  Showing people with button eyes can scare young kids  Some scenes are dark and creepy and will scare children  I recommend this movie for kids between ages 9 and 15  Great movie though very enjoyable,7
19672,436번,Coraline,7,The first time I watched this movie was when I was five  This is my most favorite movie ever I am very into creepy dark and horrorish movies tv series and books its just what I like  This movie is fun and interesting and creepy  It also has some great messages and role models  The main character shows us that you should be curious to a limit but you should still explore  The other main character shoes us to never give up and that you should always stick by your friends  This is an amazing movie in my opinion but if you are really sensitive and young then it would be probably better for them not to watch it  I hope you found my review helpfull  By the way I am 12 years old,10
19673,436번,Coraline,7,Coraline was a movie i was thoroughly dissapointed with  It was horrible and i would never tell anyone to watch it AND if they said they were going too i would tell them not too simply cause of the crappy stop motion lackluster plot and ridiculous trops that it presents definitally not worth the time,2
19674,436번,Coraline,7,This movie is definetely one of my favorites  The reviews saying that this should be for ages 13 14 and especially 17 are RIDICULOUS  I watched this movie when I was about 8 or 9 and have loved it ever sense  Maybe thats because I grew up watching horror movies and am a big strange myself  It didnt creep me out at all  If your child is anxious or very emotional maybe hold off until theyre 11  But if not really any age over 7 is good   I also think coraline is quite a role model  For a 12 year old she is very independent creative and ambitious  yes she has attitude towards her parents  but that is pretty normal,11
19675,436번,Coraline,7,5 Year olds dont understand the TRUE story to whats going on  I first watched this when I was 6 and all I could figure out was that there was an evil lady who was trying to take coraline  Now Im older Ive realized there is much more to it then that but the clues are subtle  Its a very good movie great for little kids who are into creepy things but you dont want to show them saw or something  There is no swearing in this film unless you count the cra P word to be one but its highly un noticable,5
19676,436번,Coraline,7,This movie has a great message to be happy with what you have but otherwise throw this movie inside your garbage bag  I watched this and I stayed up late cause I couldnt get to sleep  In this movie the Other Mother takes Coralines parents at the end shows gross bugs and is just plain scary and weird  The Other Mother later turns into a hideous monster who wants to put doll eyes on Coraline  Only reason I gave it 2 stars is cause of the great stop motion animation,5
19677,436번,Coraline,7,Im 14  I saw this movie when I was 7  I loved it I watched it many times and learned a lot from it  Although I was creeped out I have always been a fan of horror even when I was little and it didnt keep me up at night  If your kid is into ghosts or zombies and you think that they can handle some mature themes like dead kids absent parents etc  its a great movie  Its messed up but great  My brother on the other hand who was 9 when he saw it couldnt sleep  Hes never been a horror person and although it didnt freak him out for more than a few days he shouldve waited to see it  Evaluate whether or not your kid is a fit for the movie its worth watching if they are and you as an adult should watch it too One of my favorite animated movies,12
19678,436번,Coraline,7,I saw this movie when I was about 6 and I was so scared and I ran out of the theater and was crying because I was so scared and then my mom made me go back in and Im glad she did because it was funny and scary,1
19679,436번,Coraline,7,This movie is very creepy if you read the book,1
19749,436번,Coraline,8,its a great movie with lots of cool effects the lady with the big boobies mrs forcible WAS JUST WEARING A ZIPPER COSTUME you know like a barney costume,1
19750,436번,Coraline,8,i loved this movie I saw it when I was nine and I read the book and memorized every line from the movie my parents thought I was insane but oh well  I think this movie gave me a positive message saying things arent always as good as they may seem or be careful what you wish for  I dont think its really for kids though because some scenes are a bit scary and could possibly scar young children,3
19751,436번,Coraline,8,I love this movie It captures your attention from the beginning all the way until the end  The moral of this movie is explained by the movies slogan be careful what you wish for  Coraline discovers that the grass is not always greener on the other side  In this movie Coraline feels unloved and neglected by her parents neighbors and friend Wybie  She soon finds a little door that is bricked up  However later that night a mouse leads her to that door and a strange portal or tunnel opens up that leads to a replica of the house only everything is better  It seems as though everything is a dream come true until the other mother trys to keep her there forever  Coraline quickly discorvs the truth about the world she thought was paridice and quickly tries to escape from the spiders web,9
19752,436번,Coraline,8,Its supermelonkitty204 with your top reviews  Though Coraline might seem like a calm movie the whole film has a very creepy vibe  The story is about a young girl moving to an old apartment building in a quiet and mysterious little town  Coraline the main character travels to another dimension through a secret door in her home every night  The land is filled with succulent treats and whimsical characters  She is involved in somewhat strange activities  After several visits her other parents the ones from the other world want to sow buttons in her eyes but she refuses  When she rebels the so called wondrous land turns into a dark ruin full of hatred  Her parents are trapped and she must escape while freeing them  This strange creepy and might I say derranged movie is a stop for kids 9 and younger,10
19753,436번,Coraline,8,Which is better A movie about a girl with magical powers  bloody violence included  OR a movie about creepy people that want to sew buttons into the girls EYES then KILL her RATED R CARRIE SEEMS BETTER,2
19754,436번,Coraline,8,Be warned went I saw this when I was 8 I was freaked out of my freakin mind  It creeps me out to this day,2
19755,436번,Coraline,8,Agegroups 14,1
19756,436번,Coraline,8,I watched this when I was around nine and I freaked out  I turned it off halfway through when Coralines real parents were gone  It was disturbing and scary to me but I get freaked out easily  I wouldnt recommend it for kids below 7 though and its iffy for 89  If shehe is frightened easily then I wouldnt suggest this,5
19757,436번,Coraline,8,I myself think is an AMAZING movie  but I think it is not made for all children like for ezanple my sister  when she saw the movie she was so frittened that she cried like 5 times during the movie she even had to stay out of the theather but of course she is scared of certain things  but my brother is littler than my sister and he loved it  this is a movie I would say is for kids who are brave and enjoys a llitle scare or two  its a movie thats exiting triling mystirius and obove all scary fun  but ofcourse I am just a fan so my thoughts may be different than yours  I hope this was a help,9
19758,436번,Coraline,8,its just a little scary because of the fake mother and the trapping but overall it was really good,1
20502,484번,Descendants,8,Dont get me wrong amazing movie but THE SECOND ONE IS SO MUCH BETTER,2
20503,484번,Descendants,8,not allowed for kids under 13,1
20504,484번,Descendants,8,Im totally obsessed with the concept of this movie even as a teen,1
20505,484번,Descendants,8,First off the movie is SOOO over hyped  Another thing is that the film for some reason it gives the impression that being a rebel is cool and its good for people to be scared of you  The movies couple makes and Ben are so annoying mal just stole Ben from some girl but they still end up together    the only thing I liked was the fact Evie learned that you dont need to play dumb for people to like youwhich what Disney cjvannel shows in its tv shows,3
20506,484번,Descendants,8,Enjoyable with positive messages and unique characters but parents must beware that themes such as child abuse neglect and the effects of living in a poverty stricken society are heavy throughout  At one point two of the main characters discuss whether their parents love them followed by confessions that they are scared of their parents and what they will do to them if they dont do what they say  This is something that could start a conversation with your child but as this is a main idea throughout and something that is reinforced explicitly with dialogue I would recommend assessing the maturity of your child and exercising hesitation with kids under 10 years,3
20507,484번,Descendants,8,Ok    I  love ever after high Like it was my favourite and when I realized they made descendants    SUCH A COPY Now I have to admit I was pretty excited but when I watched it it disappointed me  I mean it completely copied EAH  There is a bit of flirting and like love and stuff like that  At one part Mal does say things like If your mom really loved you shed do this and puts Jane down by saying things like Dont you want to be prettier,8
20508,484번,Descendants,8,This was a very big Disney hit  The movie is pretty good  Predictable but good  Liked the actors and actresses,4
20509,484번,Descendants,8,Amazing,1
20510,484번,Descendants,8,IT WAS NICE TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TOO DISNEY CHARACTER S KIDS AND A NICE MUSICAL MOVIE,1
20511,484번,Descendants,8,It is very well    meh,1
21297,503번,Doctor Strange,8,My persomal MPAA rating,1
21298,503번,Doctor Strange,8,This movie is really good and though there is a small amount of blood it is mostly magical fighting  The main character gets in a car crash because of texting and loses use of his hands  The battle scenes are pretty intense though  I definitely recommend this movie  It is my 2nd favorite ever my first being AntMan,5
21299,503번,Doctor Strange,8,I just want to start of with the visuals  They are soooo good and you would thing it was real  For violence there are some medical operations minimal blood except in one scene  Fights with energy type weapons and weird swords  The ancient one dies from a stab and falls out of a portal onto the streets glass shattered  When the ancient one dies there are blood scrapes and scratches on her face you cand hear the monitor beep  Doctor strange is shown dying over and over again Impaled by crystal rocks smashed with giant hand energy beam all without blood though  If you see it you can see someone on the ground with a blood pool around there head they presumably live  Language such as shit damn hell ass and god oh my god or just god as a exclamation  Doctor strange and a fellow surgeon share a kiss  All in all a great addition to the MCU but not my favorite,11
21300,503번,Doctor Strange,8,If you decide violence is no object for your kids you should be 100 fine with them seeing it  No sexual content language is a little strong but notsorecurring,2
21301,503번,Doctor Strange,8,violence 710,1
21302,503번,Doctor Strange,8,I think this movie is good for ages nine and up but for kids who like action movies Id say eight and up its a really good movie I watch it again,1
21303,503번,Doctor Strange,8,I have seen other reviews that say doctor strange is bloody and gruesome but that is only when they show stuff in the hospital that strange works at  This movie is great but you shouldnt let kids under seven watch it  It a had a bit of violence but not to much  There is a car crash at about the 15 minute mark and it is quite intense  There is a time loop at the end where strange gets killed like ten times but it is not disturbing They only show how hes going to get killed but never actually show him getting killed  Theres also a lot of destruction but thats all,6
21698,521번,Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!,7,Good great positive messages and role models I would suggest it to familys kid friendly some insault comments but not terrible,1
21699,521번,Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!,7,Four year olds wouldnt get that the Whos lived on a speck  There is a scene with a vulture and a kangaroo  The vulture saysWhy dont you face Horton yourself The kangaroo saysIm a lady So sexist Otherwise a great movie with great messages,5

21701,521번,Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!,7,Hugely funny Likable voice actors soothing graphics this is an Ideal Cartoon  Although the physics is terrible even for a cartoon ,2
21702,521번,Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!,7,Good dr sues movie,1
21703,521번,Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!,7,This was a fantastic  comedy  for everyone to enjoy  Then again what a creepy  movie  ,5
21704,521번,Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!,7,This CGI adventure is clean for the most part and answers questions that readers have wondered for over 50 years Did the Mayor have any sort of relationship with Jojo Do the Whos know their city is a speck in space Who were Hortons friends Did Vlad feel remorse after the Whos made themselves known It just goes on and on  They also added stuff to make it longer like Hortons journey to bring the speck to safety or the existence of Morton or the good Vlad  Really fun story really fun characters and possibly the second film in movie history to exceed the book  The first was The Incredibles  The only bad part is when a malicious Senator calls the Mayor a babbling boob ,9
21705,521번,Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!,7,This is hilarious Jim Carrey was funny in this,2
21706,521번,Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!,7,I KNOW YOU GUYS THINK IS A LITTLE KIDS MOVIE BUT WHEN I SEE IT WHEN I WAS 6 I FOUND THIS FINE AND A LITTLE SCARY,1
21707,521번,Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!,7,Family can be so mean thats how the mother kangaroo is like and brothers can be mean to but theres no one like that in this movie,1
21966,535번,Dune,8,My friend told me that this movie sucked  I disagree  I really liked the cinematography and the story  The idea is pretty unique and what humor there was great  There were a lot of great actors in it also  It was kinda violent but the worst of it was a decapitation and the murderer carried the head for a bit  The most sexuality was the mention that the main characters mother was a concubine and not the wife if the father and there are a couple scenes with naked men  There is nothing exposed  Overall it was pretty good,9
21967,535번,Dune,8,This was a wonderful movie and I totally recommend it The actors were great and the scenery beautiful  The violence was not too graphic and if you are mature enough you could definitely watch it at the age of 13,3
21968,535번,Dune,8,Love timothe chalamet and he does an amazing job playing paul It stayed completly true to the book It was amazing,3
21969,535번,Dune,8,Great story effects and soundtrack,1
21970,535번,Dune,8,Dune is a rich scifi universe that I enjoy a lot   The director the same as Blade Runner 2049 makes long shots of the actors to show emotion which might make impatient viewers go insane but I personally enjoyed it,2
21971,535번,Dune,8,I thought it was a great movie  However it did feel a bit slow,2
21972,535번,Dune,8,I have never read the book I literally dont get how people can give this 5 stars and be serious about it  I watched this movie on HBO Max and I was expecting it to be entertaining  It wasnt that good at all  The fight scenes were dumb and look like a kid directed it  The story is ok  Its very confusing and incomplete  There are so many plot holes  I wanted to like it alot but I can only like bits and pieces of it,8
21973,535번,Dune,8,Compared to the awful 1954 movie this movie is a huge step up in every way This movie is definitely a mustsee if you are a scifi fan the movie has a lot of great characters and fantastic visual effects and action sequences,2
21974,535번,Dune,8,Ill keep this short,1
21975,535번,Dune,8,But there was violence but apart from that it was great and I will give it a 10 ,1
22010,542번,Easter Parade,8,Amazing Me my mom and my daddy watched it on public television  It was really funny we love making fun of old movies and there is this one moment where this women is gifted a pug puppy and she hands it to the maid and the maid makes such a disgusted face,3
22011,542번,Easter Parade,8,I watched this movie it is just incredible it doesnt involve any harmful scary violent drug drinking smoking scenes and moments some scenes may be a bit boring for younger children but it is subtitle for 6 and up,1
22311,550번,Elf,7,This movie is very funny and has messages about how you should always have a smile on your face and care about others,1
22312,550번,Elf,7,This movie is downright funny there is plenty of laughs and it never gets old This movie is one of the best Christmas ever made  not only does it keep in rage with its rating PG it is actaully a bit purecleaner than most Christmas movies well the Polar Express is cleanerpurer than this movie  I think this movie is for everyone to see  Although there is one suggestive moment with showering it is not too explicitgrpahic for young kids not to see  There is one upsetting scene where Buddys dad yells at him to get out of his life  But overall this movie delivers the fun and magic of Christmas and the true spirit of it Infrequent mild language crap piss etc  is heard but dont be too worried about that,8
22313,550번,Elf,7,Ferrells gross heartwarming fish out of water holiday story is clever has messages about differences family and belief and has spectacular goofy acting,1
22314,550번,Elf,7,This is SUCH a good film and its great for families There are some very positive messages in this film  There is some language like hell dmn son of a nutcracker up yours and shut up  And some iffy stuff like in one scene Buddy goes to a shopping mall and sees a red bra with white feathers on display and takes it and holds it up so he can see it in other scene he hears a women singing which finds out to be the girl he likes and yet shes singing in a shower naked  nudity is not shown but bare shoulders and arms are  There is also a bit of drinking  Buddy is as great role model because he is joyful and nice and has the Christmas spirit  This movie gets 5 stars and is intended for kids of the age nine and up,6
22315,550번,Elf,7,Elf is amazing It teaches kids to love themselves no matter how different they may be and it teaches kids to value family over everything else The worst it gets is a scene with some alcohol in it but besides that it is cleaner than a germaphobes house,3
22316,550번,Elf,7,Its a great movie perfect for Christmas time I watch it yearly and it never gets old  Not to mention it is very funny  The only reason I rated it 7 is because children under 7 might not understand certain parts of it   It also has a good message in it to always remember the meaning of Christmas and to spread Christmas cheer whenever you can  The father in this movie is a very mean person at the beginning and then changes for the good at the end  That is a good role model,7
22317,550번,Elf,7,This is a funny entertaining classic with good characters and writing  id recommend it for families looking for a fun Christmas movie  My suggested age rating would would be PG parental guidance for mild violence and some rude humour,3
22318,550번,Elf,7,Elf is the story of Buddy the Elf  a man who grows up making toys for Santa in the North Pole  He decides to take a trip to New York City to find his biological father and has several misadventures upon his arrival  This movie is adorable sweet and funny with a couple of iffy spots here and there   Its probably best not to show this to kids who still believe in Santa Claus  Aside from that there is a scene where Buddy innocently goes into the womens locker room so he can listen to the girl he likes singing in the shower and a couple of fight scenes  Other than that its a great movie that your kids will probably love,6
22319,550번,Elf,7,I thought Elf was funny It really shows the Christmas spirit,1
23101,564번,Epic,8,A good plot formed movie however it is not that epic in my opinion,1
23102,564번,Epic,8,Epic is a visually appealing movie but sadly has a derivative storyline  The Positives are The Voice acting Believable acting and most of all each actor fits the character that it portrays the animation Visually appealing nicely designed and fittingly gorgeous the music it fits the movie and is at times on cue with the emotions at hand the pace very fast and finally the messages I liked how it showed that Relationships are important never give up and always forgive  The Negatives are the derivative storyline Pretty much steals Narrative ideas from Avatar The Littles and Honey I Shrunk the Kids the lack of character development Pretty much no characters are developed typical bad guy Nothing about him stands out as well as his background isnt explored clichd fatherdaughter relationship and finally the movie wasnt epic The title is epic and in No way was the movie actually that and was rather small in scope  I would not recommend this film,4
23103,564번,Epic,8,It has good messages as well as not nice swear words,1
23104,564번,Epic,8,In my opinion it didnt quite reach the level of epic but it was good  The scenery was quite magnificent and creative with its majestic colours  Furthermore it was violent but nothing like gore and blood just sword fighting very awesome  Also there was funny scenes but mostly they involve with a slug a very dashing and cool one  However I was disappointed of the way they put the moral out  The character kind of went a bit of track in the solution of defeating the evil and didnt give me a powerful message but a very weak one  All in all the movie had colourful scenes and had a sense of humor but they didnt quite put the moral out very well as for the romance was a bit bad I have to mention and a boring time to time  Thats my opinion though,8
23105,564번,Epic,8,good sometimes boring  i only liked ais ansari,2
23106,564번,Epic,8,Im 10 and this movie was pretty good  it might be a little to violentscary for kids under 7  its not bloody or any thing intense its little guys and the bad guys try to destory the forest  If i could chose the MPAA rating and reason it would be this film is rated PG for Mild Action and scary events for young kids,3
23107,564번,Epic,8,Its a really good movie and it doesnt have any rude parts Some of the parts are really funny Children you celebrities well will probably know Beyonce so kids will be crazy about it but tell the kids that she is only there for beginning part because after that she dies,1
23108,564번,Epic,8,Epic is a nice movie that can create a franchise once again for Blue Sky  It is a very different story and is a fun movie for kids  BottomLine It is fun movie for kids as it has a different story,3
23109,564번,Epic,8,My sister who is 4 years old was very scared of the part of the movie that was about decay and minimen in dead rat bodies but for me it was the best movie of 2013 because I love nature and archery and it has a lot of this in the movie,1
23654,589번,Far from the Madding Crowd,8,My ratingPG13 for racy contentand gory images,1
24149,609번,Finding Dory,8,I saw it in the theaters for my birthday present  When i saw it I LOVED IT I will tell you that this is one of the best animated drama movies of the year that it was made  For like twenty years or something of all drama films this one is awarded for  APPROPRIATENESS FOR KIDS OF ALL AGES  I mean little kids with no taste of emotion would want to see itMan Im talking like preschool  I think Dory starring in place of Nemo would be something the kids would want to see  Plus the characters during Dorys search for her parents inspire the kids  So lay down on the couch turn on the tv and watch some Finding Dory,9
24150,609번,Finding Dory,8,This movie is very well appropriate for kids that love adventure  A good part that I saw was a funny part where the otters drove a van Mildly scary no violence at all  I recommend it,4
24151,609번,Finding Dory,8,I thought finding dory was a good and funny movie because dory cant find her family  she stayed with marlins family until she can find her family she thought her family was dead and final her family was alive,2
24152,609번,Finding Dory,8,Its supposed to be funny and cheery for little 5 and 6 year olds but honestly I nearly cried at some bits AND IM 11 But they did hide an obvious sexual joke at the start    5 and 6 year olds definitely would not understand  Families When your 5 or 6 year old asks about mummies and daddies and babies blame Pixar and Disney,3
24153,609번,Finding Dory,8,I think that it is a great film with a great message about teamwork  there is no bad language and it isnt too sad,2
24154,609번,Finding Dory,8,I find the content in the movie quite offensive  It is definitely not the Pixar I am used to,2
24155,609번,Finding Dory,8,This movie has you laughing from the first scene to the last one  It is very humorous for kids and adults alike  My mom and I couldnt stop imitating Bailey once we walked out of the theater  The story is about young dory trying to find her parents and introduces a lot of good life skills to kids such as what to do if you encounter a whale shark  Excellent movie and family friendly,6
24156,609번,Finding Dory,8,I watched Finding Nemo when I was about 4 years old and loved it When this came out 13 years later it was well made  It had a different plot new loving characters plus some very emotional moments  Dory is a great role model because although shes forgetful she never gives up on finding her family and always refers to her childhood to help her in sticky situations  Plus some other characters play great role models like Destiny who always warns and helps Dory and her friends  The film also has great messages involving not giving up and family and sticking together is important  Although there are a couple of scenes that may disturb young children such as when Dory gets separated or a giant squid chases Dory and her friends  Overall amazing made sequel and is a great choice for kids age 6 and up,8
24157,609번,Finding Dory,8,On par with Finding Nemo,1
24158,609번,Finding Dory,8,it is a very very good sequel to finding memo  you have to watch finding memo to understand the movie,1
24276,611번,Finding Nemo,8,Finding Nemo is a really good movie  It can teach children how aquatic animals interact with each other and what they look like  There is one scary scene that involves a menacing angler fish,3
24277,611번,Finding Nemo,8,This movie is funny not boring so it keeps moving  This movie has very little intense scenes  Bruce the antagonist the shark maybe a little scary for youngsters but I think that Dory and Nemos dad handle it very well  This is a positive well made family movie that is a classic still to this day,4
24278,611번,Finding Nemo,8,Loved this movie and it also taught me lots about the ocean,1
24279,611번,Finding Nemo,8,Pixar has made a lot of amazing films but this may just be just the best one yet   Nemo Dory and Marlin are some of the best movie characters for children ever   One thing for parents to understand is that there is a lot of suspense and action throughout that may upset younger viewers   6 sounds about right   By the way theres very little consumerism,5
24280,611번,Finding Nemo,8,Finding Nemo is a pretty good movie great messages  its a little educational showing all the ocean animals but not too much   Has some scary parts like sharks wanting to eat the fish and at one point some bombs under water go off so some kids might be scared also some moments where some beards try to eat the main characters and a lot of sad moments so I didnt like the movie too much because it was kind of sad a lot but I think a lot of other people would still like it,2
24281,611번,Finding Nemo,8,Finding Nemo is a fun family film but its important to know that this film has some very dark moments,1
24282,611번,Finding Nemo,8,I Would Rate This 0 Stars If I Could  First Of All  When Coral And All But One Baby Get Eaten By A Shark I Thought What Why Cant Coral Just Have To Go Somewhere Else For Some Reason And Could Take All But One Baby  The Next Thing Thats Wrong With It Is The Violence  I Mean When Blood Is Shown It Leads To A NearDeath Shark Attack  Also Did They HAVE To Give Darla A Reputation For Killing Fish Beacause She Shakes The Bag Too Hard Why Cant Nemo Just Not Want To Go With Her Beacause He Was Afraid Hed Never See His Father Again Also Does Nemo Have To Be Kidnapped In The First Place Why Couldnt He Just Have Something Special Taken Away From Him The Last Thing Is Its Just Plain Old Boring The Only Reason Why Ive Seen It Twice Was To Try Out The Movie Then I Had To Watch It Again Beacause I Was At Summer Camp  Its Just Plain Old Terrible  Dont Bother,12
25438,653번,Frozen 2,8,Boring  Most of it is music and the music is not even good,2
25439,653번,Frozen 2,8,Loved it quite emotional at some points though,1
25440,653번,Frozen 2,8,Even though the visuals were great Olaf was at his prime and Panic at the Discos Into the Unknown is excellent the story itself falls short  Also there was too much focus on Elsa  The whole Elsa this and Elsa that was annoying  Anna shouldve been the fifth spirit,4
25441,653번,Frozen 2,8,This is totally child friendly  There are no bad words or anything inappropriate  There is a lot of singing which kinda made it feel like there was not a main plot but I like this movie and my sisters watched this and they loved it  The characters are silly and creative  There are some intense parts but theyre not really intense but it may be to some really sensitive kids  There are two characters that are a couple which some parents may think that it is not for younger kids and it kinda just depends,6
25442,653번,Frozen 2,8,Frozen is a good movie in my opinion  Its good at showing the relationship of two sisters its story is standard for a Disney princess movie but it is a good modern interpretation  Frozen 2 is not anywhere near the first  The less focus on characters makes the amazing cast feel seperated  Every B story has almost nothing to do with the final plot points and could be summarized in a sentence  I think some of the stuff with the forest people and Arendelle is good but its few and far between,6
25443,653번,Frozen 2,8,So this movie has much better quality and the animations are a lot better  The songs are catchy and the plot is really awesome  My jaw dropped a lot when I saw this in theaters a year ago,3
25444,653번,Frozen 2,8,I really liked it better than the first movieFrozen wasnt really as much of a story OK i gave it 4 stars because it was slightly scary  I have a fear of movies there are only 3 movies i like including this So NEVER take a little kid because Im 100 sure that theyll be scared unless you have a 1ina billon sibling  who is REALLYREALLY brave,2
25570,653번,Frozen 2,6,I WOULD DEFINITELY SEE IT  ITS SO POSITIVE AND GREAT FOR EVERYONE  I COULDNT STOP LAUGHING  I ALSO SANG MY LUNGS OUT,4
25571,653번,Frozen 2,6,i loved this movie it had an awesome plot and great music it was just as good as the first movie if not better i loved it and it was so good it really kept me in the plot the whole time,5
25572,653번,Frozen 2,6,frozen 2 is WAY better than the first one  it answers so many questions about the old movie  and for the parents with younger kids a war is mentioned and elsa almost dies  thats all i have to say,4
25573,653번,Frozen 2,6,Frozen 2 is a surprisingly good movie I expected it to be half par not near as good as the first one   I went into it expecting the happy sing along mild peril feature that the first one had been  I am here to tell you that this is not the same as the original,4
25574,653번,Frozen 2,6,Has a few emotional scenes that made everyone in the theater cry      songs were good        new characters were GREAT        I liked it and definitely recommend it,2
25575,653번,Frozen 2,6,Flawless,1
25576,653번,Frozen 2,6,No spoilers The whole thing was seriously interesting and engaging Im 16 now and it actually gave me a similar feeling of interest excitement and nostalgia after seeing it that the first one did when I was 10  A lot of teens try to seem cool by acting like theyre too old for movies like these but to me these kinds of movies are all I could really wish for in this world nowadays  The songs are great the score the soundtrackbackground music is great  It could be a little scary at times depending on the kid but my 4 year old sister made it though and loved it despite the moments that she claims she got a little scared  Good amount of everything that makes a movie good family friendlywell made  They did a really good job of carrying the magic over and conveying it in a way that got the teens experiencing the same pleasure and excitement they felt when they saw the first film those 6 years ago  I highly recommend it and any of you too old kids go ahead and give it a chance,8
25577,653번,Frozen 2,6,I kinda like this because     Well theres a horse,2
25726,654번,Frozen,8,I think frozen is a nice movie for young children amazing songs a very good movie,1
25727,654번,Frozen,8,Frozen has SPOILER ALERT tragic not graphic parent death early on  Later the sisters grow up apart and isolated from each other  Also Elsa has to hide her power going so far as to always wear gloves  This is later resolved when Elsa sings the powerful number about being ones true self  Anna meanwhile gets engaged to a man she met on the first day only to learn hes a monster figuratively and goes on to learn that love takes time and trust and honesty  This movies themes are self acceptance sisterly love understanding love takes time and we need each other  All in all its an amazing movie with important themes and wonderious music,7
25728,654번,Frozen,8,This movie was very exiting,1
25729,654번,Frozen,8,There is literally nothing worthwhile in this movie  I like the feminist message but its terrible  Dont bother its not worth it,3
25730,654번,Frozen,8,No Role Models  Its All About Violence And Sex,2
25731,654번,Frozen,8,I really liked this movievery interesting plot  Cute charactersfantastic animation   Olaf is probably my favourite character  The let it go song was great and had awesome visuals  I really liked this movie for sure,5
25732,654번,Frozen,8,GREAT family movie Love the characters The movie starts with Elsa and Anna being great friendssisters but Elsas magic makes them drift apart,1
25733,654번,Frozen,8,Nothing more nothing less,1
25734,654번,Frozen,8,this movie is forking mint  NOT for children  ELsa shoots her sister almost killing her  this movie encurages kids to MURDER their siblings  Not good for your children  Good for only children to teach them the importance of being an only child,6
25735,654번,Frozen,8,In the Film i Like olaf the snowman he sings summer melts in a fireplace But stops melting In a home with trolls olaf tells anna to run        while he distrasts them says Hi Im Olaf and I Like Warm Hugswarning these are spoilers so if you have not seen the movie yet maybe stop reading,4
25877,654번,Frozen,8,Its okay in parts but its a bit slow to start off with  Theres just to many songs and not enough plot I ended up a bit bored  Ana the main character is a bit stupid and aggrees to marry a guy the evening the meet  Elsa is taught to do the exact opposite of what the troll guys say at the beginning and learns to fear her powere  The snowman was a bit annoying and overall I cant really see what everybodies raving on about,5
25878,654번,Frozen,8,I watched this for the first time in august with my family online for free  While I was watching it I saw the part where Elsa sings Let it go  I thought that was the best part of the movie but everything else Nuhuh  Personally I think the 80s anime series Saint Seiya is better,5
25879,654번,Frozen,8,Frozen is a great Disney animated movie that will be loved by all ages Both of the Royal sisters send positive messages to viewers  Queen Elsa has a powerful ice magic gift but is too scared to use it for fear of hurting the ones she cares about specifically her younger sister Princess Anna  However once her powers are revealed Elsa soon learns that its okay to be different and others will accept het for who she is  The hit song Let It Go performed by the spectacular Idina Menzel shows that no matter who you are you should never be afraid to just let it go and show off what you can do  Princess Annas strong passion for her sister urges the young girl on a dangerous mission that she might not return from  She teaches people that no matter what family is everything and if you stick together you can acomplish anything from climbing a mountain to surviving a Frozen Heart,7
25880,654번,Frozen,8,this movie is great  it tells you about sister life,3
25881,654번,Frozen,8,I saw this movie in a theater and I liked it but I wouldnt recommend it for all kids though but it may be ok for most,1
25882,654번,Frozen,8,Im not trying to be a sourpuss but well I am a teen girl and unlike most teen girls I hated this movie  There are so many scary scenes think should a 36 year old be watching a character freeze to death a princess almost get stabbed have there hear frozen  Stick with the classics like Beauty and the beast one of my favorite movies  The only character I liked was Sven  And this is not the first movie to teach girls that you dont need a man beauty and the beast Mulan Brave,5
25883,654번,Frozen,8,Yes I know a modernised take doesnt sound too great but actually I was quite surprised to find out this film was a perfect family film  It has entertaining characters a strong story and       well its just a lovely film and if I was younger I would be happy to call this my childhood film,2
25884,654번,Frozen,8,bad movie so dont even bother it was 52 good and 48 bad  ViolenceViolence is when a girl which is cursed makes ice spikes and when a girl safe fire at wolves and an ice monster shouts at someone Language not a problem Sex not a problem,2
25885,654번,Frozen,8,Your daughters will LOVE this movie if they love disney animation princess movies like this one  The movies animation is stunning and beautiful especially the opening sequences with the snowflakes  The animaters did a superb job with the animation in the movie  You also learn that you dont need a guy to save you in this movie  You will love the characters  Elsa is the oldest sister  She is very protective of her family and friend particularly her younger sister Anna  Elsa also melts frozen peoples hearts with love  Elsa loves her sister Anna  She wants to be the person she truly is even though she has ice powers  She wants to let it go and be the person she truly is  Elsa is voiced really well by Idina Menzel  Elsa is a great big sister in the movie and youll clearly see why  Anna is her little sister  Anna wants to find true love but later on in the movie learns what true love really is  Love is putting someone elses needs before your own  Anna is also clumsyloves chocolateand longs for adventure  Anna is a great little sister especially in one scene in the movie  Olaf is a snowman who says  Hi everyone Im Olaf and I like warm hugs   Olaf is a very likable snowman  Hes funny in the movie and a very likable character  You can clearly see why  The movie is based off of Hans Christian Andersons The snow queen  Frozen has more positive messages and isnt dark unlike the story it was based off of  You learn a lot of messages about the importance of sisterhood and family in the movie  Frozen grossed over 1 billion dollars worldwide  Good job Disney You will love the soundtrack in the movie as well as the animation Definitely deserves an A  You will not be disappointed in this film  Its also a classic for Disney princesses all over the world,30
25886,654번,Frozen,8,The movie is amazing Everything is appropriate the songs are really catchy and it has funny characters Olaf of course,2
25923,654번,Frozen,8,I thought frozen was a very boring and dissapointing movie  It had 2 princesess  Very girly,3
25924,654번,Frozen,8,viewers need to know that frozen is an animated movie based on 2 sisters whos parents pass away  there is a really good story behind the movie it tells girls that you dont need a by to love you,2
25925,654번,Frozen,8,I love the movie but common sense are such liars,1
25926,654번,Frozen,8,I just love this movie because it teaches little children about love and care for each other and that love is something that happens in a couple days not in love at first sight,2
25927,654번,Frozen,8,I think Frozen is a beautiful funny and adventurous movie  It contains love but the love is sisterly love between Elsa and Anna  I love it when Olaf says gasp I have my own personal flurry,4
25928,654번,Frozen,8,it was an ok movie but everyone says its all girl power and thats the most inaccurate thing ive EVER heard first off all the girls have heads too big for their bodies and giant eyes whereas the guys look HUMAN and anna couldnt have made it into the mountains without the dudes help what was his name  and elsa was made out to be a coward  plus im the only person in the world who doesnt like let it go,5
25929,654번,Frozen,8,It was okay but really wasnt as good as I expected when I saw the trailer  I like the whole moral about true love and I do like that the girl is saved by the girl instead of the boy,2
25930,654번,Frozen,8,Nothing too scary just some swords and kissing 2 moments but overall you should be fine to take anyone to this movie   But if you take a little 5yearold they might just want to buy everything Frozen after the movie,2
25931,654번,Frozen,8,it is a good family film  i recermend you to watch it,2
25932,654번,Frozen,8,This movie is amazing although I wish they didnt make Hans the bad guy I thought Hans was going to end up with Elsa and kristoff and Anna were going to end up together but over all I think it was the best Disney movie ever,1
25982,654번,Frozen,7,This is one of the best animated movies I have ever seen and I have seen a lot It has great morals and has very high replay video  I saw this movie twice on a computer and once in theaters  This is for all ages,4
25983,654번,Frozen,7,The movie is so much fun The messages are great and Id recommend it for all ages The movie is so funny and the songs are very catchy  The plotline is original and even adults enjoy it  The songs are so much fun and Olaf has many funny quotes  Amazing movie,6
25984,654번,Frozen,7,This movie is awesome  Both of the girls are really tough and the animation and songs are both awesome  I can have a song stuck in my head really easily,3
25985,654번,Frozen,7,I really loved this movie  Unlike an original Disney princess movie its not about finding a prince  Frozen has great lessons and messages but there are also some parts that little kids might be scared of such as spoiler the snow monster Marshmallow and the fight between Hans and the guards and Marshmallow  Otherwise its a great movie,4
25986,654번,Frozen,7,This instant classic is already a hit with Disney fans around the world  Once you see it you wont be able to get the songs out of your head  For days  Yes it is that good  With quite possibly the biggest plot twist except for that WreckItRalph shocker in Disney history this movie will send chills down your spine every time you see it  The only issue was the condensed story to fit the limited time frame  It seemed so rushed and unplanned  Overall though this movie never fails to impress both the younger and older audiences with both breathtaking animation and showstopping tunes that your daughter wont stop singing,8
25987,654번,Frozen,7,Sweet movie  I loved it  I might be a dilettante when it comes to movie reviews but this stressed the love between sisters  So sweet,4
25988,654번,Frozen,7,Perfect for the whole family   Disney movies who knew,2
25989,654번,Frozen,7,Some scenes may be scary for children A main character almost dies but overall theres no gore virtually no sex related stuff just one kiss no swearing and this is actually a really good movie as a 13 year old I still enjoyed it the songs were pretty good,1
25990,654번,Frozen,7,I love it I would give it five out of five stars  The movie is about two sisters one has ice powers and the other one is ordinary  Have you seen Tangled If so then you should definitely see frozen  I am totally sure that you will love it,5
26083,661번,Furious 7,8,I think that this is too much for younger children under 12 I just dont think that younger children would watch this but what I think it is its really just a porn movie,1
26084,661번,Furious 7,8,Lots of action packed scenes with explosives and car crashes   Some fight scenes with guns   Only a couple curses   The movie itself is very good   Also the soundtrack is really good to   A sad movie that you wont want to miss,6
26085,661번,Furious 7,8,The 7th fast and furious film says farewell to Paul walker  With great action and extreme stunt  But not for kids not teens as there is swearing and intense peril,3
26086,661번,Furious 7,8,loved every moment non stop action plenty of car chases few girls in bikinis great stunts bit of swearing,2
26087,661번,Furious 7,8,Furious 7 was one of my  most anticipated movies EVER  And it did not disappoint  Violence language and moderate nudity with lots of sexual references  Violence some blood explosions gun fights fist fights and plain mayhem  Language Lots of s words 30 probably  15 d words 22 a words 1 f word 12 b words and some others  Sex Pretty strong nudity with rear female nudity for about 1015 minutes with gstring bikinis dancing on poles in a Dubai club scene  Lots of drinking and great models makes this movie a A excitement action flick,8

26089,661번,Furious 7,8,A great movie Everything was amazing  I watched it in the cinema with my cousin and younger siblings  My little sister was irritated by the disturbing content but my brother and I loved it,3
26090,661번,Furious 7,8,This is the sequel to the 2013s hit Fast  and Furious 6except this time there fighting the bad guy Owen Shawns  brother  This sequel is insanely violentcharacters are stabbedshotbashedhave there skulls crackednecks brokenheads bashedother characters fall to there deathlose there limbsor explode to bits  Even though none of the violence is graphic or even realistic is still overthetop  There is also lots of nudityscantily clad womenbreastsand bottoms are seen through panties and brastheres also tons of innuendo and sexual references  There is tons of frequent strong language including 1 fk 20 st ahole bh and son of a bh  This movie is very thrillingawesomeslickand no where near boring but it still is to violent for even the oldest teens  My ratingR for strong violence throughoutbloody imagesdisturbing imagesand some sexual contentnudity,6
26429,680번,Ghostbusters,6,very very weird pretty bad graphics too  more comedy than scary  not scary at all,3
26430,680번,Ghostbusters,6,This is a really great classic movie  Its not a masterpiece obviously but its really funny A few scenes needed for skipping like implied sexual content that is never shown but you definitely can tell what is going on  We skipped these scenes obviously so I recommend you do the same  The language isnt too bad  This move now days I believe would be rated PG13 but its still really funny and I think everyone should watch it because its such a  classic  One more question for you     who you gonna call,7
26431,680번,Ghostbusters,6,This movie was disappointing because of the sexual content and notevencomical stupidity  PG is not a good rating for this movie,2
26432,680번,Ghostbusters,6,You need to know at the 3rd scene there is a really scary ghost its about 10mins in the movie its when the ghostbusters come to check the library and near the end off the scene the ghost screams and turns in a skeleton and theres another scene when one of the ghostbusters dreams of a ghost and it is not appropriate for younger kids,1
26433,680번,Ghostbusters,6,This is a really funny movie but has some questionable material,1
26434,680번,Ghostbusters,6,Good for ages 11  It has some violence sex and swearing,2
26435,680번,Ghostbusters,6,Ghostbusters is an awesome movie but theres plenty of swearing  I would rate this movie PG13 for the language  Also in most scenes one of the ghostbusters is smoking a cigarette  For a mature audience I definitely recommend this movie,5
26436,680번,Ghostbusters,6,A LITTLE SCARY FOR KIDS ,1
26437,680번,Ghostbusters,6,The ghosts look really good animated and so are the proton streams,1
26457,680번,Ghostbusters,8,My rating pg13 for some violence implied sex some language including 2 dks and smoking,1
26458,680번,Ghostbusters,8,This movie was just average to me  It was nothing too special just a little comedy that tries a bit too hard  But with all i can say about this movie I can definitely say that this is a classic just because of the stay puft marshmallow man  Over all just a decent movie,4
26459,680번,Ghostbusters,8,Good movie,1
26460,680번,Ghostbusters,8,This iconic movie may appear to be a scary horror movie however when you actually sit down to watch it you will realise that it is not at all scary other than a few brief appearances of ghosts  It is worth noting however that there are many hidden sexual innuendos in this movie but whether this movie is suitable for children depends upon whether they understand the sex jokes or not  All in all it is a great and hilarious classic,3
26461,680번,Ghostbusters,8,Classic comedy is alright but lacks something     ,1
26462,680번,Ghostbusters,8,I dont feel I even need to write a full review  Its a creative original fun and action packed classic  If you havent already then what are you still doing here GO see it right now,4
26463,680번,Ghostbusters,8,I LOVE Ghostbusters 1 and 2,1
26464,680번,Ghostbusters,8,This is my favorite movie but there are a few negative elements I suggest vidangeling out ghost oral sex launguege  This has great messages including teamwork and friendship,2
26465,680번,Ghostbusters,8,This film is from the 80s and like most films from that timeline it has language the s word is said at least 5 times in the film one of the characters has a dream where he gets Oral pleasure from a ghost  And Peter is a borderline sexual predator  overall great film but not for small kids,3
26466,680번,Ghostbusters,8,I liked the movie but it can be scary for younger kids It also includeslanguageLots of smokingand in some scenes lots of sex Crude humor is in Ghostbusters too,1
27405,711번,Gremlins,8,I found out that Santa was not real when I was 9  The gremlins die in a rather violent way but mature 9 year olds can handle this only if they know about Santa,2
27406,711번,Gremlins,8,My family and I were looking for a good 80s movie  We went to Netflix and saw Gremlins  At first we didnt want to watch it but then when it started it got really funny  Especially Gremlins swinging on the fan,4
27407,711번,Gremlins,8,This movie is an amazing classic  What people need to know about Gremlins is that there is some violence but most is just gremlins getting killed   There is some blood but most is gremlin blood which is green this might make it seem less violent   Most of the gremlin blood is shown in a few scenes where a mother fights off a small group of gremlins   The only human blood is mostly just scratches attained by character who survive the movie   There is a little language but nothing really bad   In one part gremlins smoke and drink beer   The final confrontation with the last gremlin might scare young kids   Overall this movie isnt necessarily scary and a great classic that is definitely worth watching,9
27408,711번,Gremlins,8,This film is not your typical boygetspet style film  This came out before PG13 ratings  If it was rerated it would be PG13 like Jaws  This film is intense and surprisingly frightening but a well done job by Steven Spielberg  Gremlins are gruesomely killed along with grizzly human deaths and attacks  Humans are bitten scratched and killed by gremlins  Gremlins mainly jump onto humans and cling on and start attacking  A old woman is killed by them thinking theyre demons trying to take her by her elevating chairs wires are tampered with by gremlins and send it spiraling it up the stairs at about 80 mph and send her through a window  Many car crashes  A man tries to lure out a gremlin with a candy bar he is then bitten and is shown with him lying on the ground with a syringe in his butt never revealed if he was killed or unconscious  Gremlins chase a couple into a house with a snowplow they survive  Most human deaths are off screen leaving the viewer to imagine extremely gruesome deaths  A gremlin is killed in a blender green bloodslime spews everywhere  Another one is repeatedly stabbed off screen  A gremlins shoved into a microwave and explodes into a green bloodslime pulp all over the inside of the microwave  Another gremlins decapitated its head is show burning in a fire place  A kid shoots gremlins with a sling shot off his roof  He fights off another one by cutting Christmas lights leaving the gremlin to fall  It doesnt show if the gremlins die from the fall in this scene  Gremlins burn to death and then explode when a gas leak is lit in a movie theater  Gremlins shootthreaten with guns  A man is shot is the arm with a crossbow by Spike and is then attacked with a chainsaw  SPOILER The leader gremlin Spike is killed when exposed to sunlight  His skin melts off revealing muscle tissue his eyes roll into the back of his head and wails in pain  His corpse falls into a fountain his bones jump out and then melt into a goo  SPOILER OVER Gizmo is somewhat of a good role model of how he follows the rules and refuses to eat after midnight unlike the other gremlins  Once the gremlins turn they become creepy instead of cuddly and may scare young children  Some jumpscares  Constant usages of hell dmn god Jesus Jesus Christ etc  But its mild  Gremlins drink like fishes and smoke  Some gremlins are clearly wasted  Worst in sexual stuff is a gremlin flasher but they dont has visible genitals so is not that bad  One kiss scene  Mild flirting  This is a must see film but for tweens and up  Fine for 11,37
27409,711번,Gremlins,8,Gremlins was the first horrorcomedy that I watched and I watched it 5 years ago and it didnt scare me  It doesnt have any swear words the violence is tamer than most kids films  Good movie for the family,3
27410,711번,Gremlins,8,It is so cute when Gizmo drives the little car and when he waves the flag I really enjoyed this movie,2
27411,711번,Gremlins,8,Okay lets be fair this movie was made before pg 13 was invented but that story about that girls father is devastating to me I really hate storys were people get stuck in there own house and no one knows  I watched this movie when I was like 5 or 6 and I dont remember that part I watched it again and that part was just awful I wouldnt recommend it to any one under 11,2
27412,711번,Gremlins,8,Cool movie  Its not my favorite but my 7 year old brother really likes it  Hes obsessed Summary WARNING SPOILER ALERT,4
27413,711번,Gremlins,8,Good movie,1
27414,711번,Gremlins,8,I think gremlins is a good movie but best for tweens and teens because it has quite a bit of violence and scariness but this is my favorite movie of all time,1
27630,716번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,So the movie started out a little weird but then it was the usual Rocket Racoon Baby Groot StarLord and Gamora  There are also lot of funny scenes with baby Groot   Then they start fighting bad guys  Later they get attacked but win  Character drama happens here and there  There was a lot of family reunion stuff along with references to the 1st movie  I think any 10 year old should be allowed watch this movie,7
27631,716번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,This was an amazing sequel and yet again it had a great plot great acting but had more humor and scifi action The film does contain plenty of language including several uses of st dk plus more  Also the film contains plenty of suggestive content  This involves sexual tension between several characters and some mild sexual references  However this film does not skimp on the scifi violence and action and definitely amps it up are than the first film  Just like the first film there is plenty of combat swords guns tasers and shootouts and explosions plus a high body count  Overall this is a great sequel that is great for kids 12 and up,7
27632,716번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,so awesome  there wasnt anything too bad except for a few fks and st  it was also very funny,3
27633,716번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,I had no idea what was going on This could have been due that I did not watch the first  It was also very silly in a ridiculous way and there were lots of curse words,3
27634,716번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,ANOTHER CLASSIC action comedy  with great messages burderned by some content still entertaining,2
27635,716번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,This movie was hillarious and amazing  It had enough sex jokes to give it its rating but it also had some family friendly jokes that the younger aundience would get  There is one part that I would cover my kids ears for  There is one scene when Star Lords father was talking about his mother and how Star Lord came to Be and Drax asked him if he had a penis and full details about them having sex  He also said that his father would tell him stories when he was a child about him making his mother pregnant  Thats really it for the sexual content  Language is really what you would expect to see in a PG13 movie  St Dough bag Dk ass ass hole Bch bastard and danmmit  I think that this movie is appropiate for kid who know what sex and when it is appropiate for it to happen and can hanndle some language  Hope this helped,10
27636,716번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,i think that this was even better than the first one i also think that that one review about how it was not good for kids and it lowers  a girl self esteem   newsflash  those girls in the club were robots therefore in my opinion  it was fine  by the way i also watche this in the cinema with my younger brothers ages 8 and 5   and they were not affected at all,4
27637,716번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,This action packed sequel was more funny than the first movie but the plot was more confusing and not quite as interesting  In the first spectacular film I laughed out loud about two times  In this great add on I must have laughed at least ten more  Baby groot was so much more funny than ordinary groot and he had a hilarious role in the opening scene  Chris Pratt had some very good acting and Rocket the raccoon actually got emotional in a few scenes  The profanity in this movie was not as frequent however it ended up having about the same amount  as the first movie because it was very very long  This movie also had some dazzling effects but it was sometimes pretty brutal  The plot of the movie was a little more confusing because the team split up for some of the movie and it kind of changed about one third through the film  Other than the violence I think something to know that this movie has some sexual content some subtle while some is pretty obvious such as one reference to a mans body parts  However if your child is mature than that would not be an issue at all  There were a few sad scenes and as common sense media already stated a character dies but he does it to save his friends which I thought was a good twist  My favorite character was actually not Groot and in fact a new character named Mantis who is an alien who can sense the emotions of living creatures and even change them  The funny thing is that when she is not using her powers she does not understand emotions so she often gets them mixed up such as a character calls her ugly and this makes her happy  Another major role in the movie is the addition of eighties music which is still used very often in this movie  This is a great movie for a family movie night or to see in theaters with a friend  Thank you for reading my review,16
27820,717번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,This is one of the best marvel movies I saw ever besides ant man it had action laughs and it was just fun a great marvel movie,1
27821,717번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,This movie is awesome so let a lot of tweens see this  The violence and swearing is like most other superhero movies,2
27822,717번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,This is the best marvel movie ever Great comedy great action great storyline Im gonna watch Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol  2 tonight  Im hoping its gonna be good,5
27823,717번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,It is a great movie but there is a lot of violence and swearing  There is a little consumerism when the movie shows that Peters music player is Sony brand,2
27824,717번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,This movie is unlike most other Marvel movies in that it has a less dark tone  There is more humour than you may expect and there are several cheerful and upbeat songs to relieve moments of tension  However there is also a lot of fantasy violence which is expected from a Marvel movie set in outer space   There is some strong language and one sad moment however the overall message is positive,4
27825,717번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,A gang of space oddballs unite to save the Galaxy,1
27826,717번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,Although being an almost Unknown comic  Marvel did a great job bringing it alive in an entertaining humorous film  If I were u I think u should start watching this franchise,2
27827,717번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,Quality This is a really good movie and I cant wait for its sequel  Just like all marvel movies its hardcore action but its also hilarious seriously apart from the first scene every scene had at least one joke that made me laugh out loud  Great movie entertaining all the way through I really recommend that you see it,3
27828,717번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,There are lots of reviews that say that this movie has lots of violence sex etc  But there is really not too many things that are or should be concerning  This movie is definitely one of the least violent marvel movies  I do not know why people are saying that there is so much violence and sex and drugs and swearing,4
27829,717번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,Great movie but not for the younger children a lot  of swearing in s  t and f  k but very funny and exciting i think this is a movie many people will enjoy,1
28571,728번,Happy Feet,8,I keep seeing all the same things on herea bunch white conservative super religious moms who are flipping out over how offensive and perverted this movie is  Like would you please let it go and shut up already  Lookthe movie has like one or two innuendos in it like a lot of movies do  Get over it  People watching this apparently seem to forget that when the penguins talk about finding a mate they mean finding love and happiness  And when penguins become mates they have sex  Any joke you find too offensive your child will likely be too young to understand  Having sex and mates is what penguins too in the wild  Dont listen to the other reviews telling you how awful this movie is and how its too perverted  The penguins sing to each other  One or two of the lyrics are a bit sexual  Thats about it  Move on and get over it  Your kid will probably enjoy this movie just be aware of a few scary scenes witha leopard seal and youre all good  Please stop getting offended over a bunch of penguins singing old pop love songs to each other  Your kid is eventually going to learn about sex anyway,16
28572,728번,Happy Feet,8,pengguins shouldnt talk,1
28573,728번,Happy Feet,8,This my favourite movie of all time,1
28574,728번,Happy Feet,8,I watched this in school and Ill be honest  it was rather disappointing  While the characters were cute and the message good there were not just innuendos but scenes entirely centered around penguins mating  Personally I feel like the adult humer was a bit over the top,3
28575,728번,Happy Feet,8,This movie is simply adorable  Lots of cute penguin power with a powerful message of being unique  Definitely a great movie for families  WARNING Only a smidge of scarinessintense scenes  Movie focused around penguins finding mates  film suitable for older children,5
28576,728번,Happy Feet,8,I saw this movie when I was only three and loved the singing dancing and animals  The message convey in the story is very true in reality today  The songs are live songs so yes they have sexual refreances but the kids wont catch on unless you make a big deal about it  The antichristinan message is not what the movie show rather that believing that someone that doesnt nessassery follow the guidelines is causing all the trouble is very wrong and that everyone is different their own speical way  Perfect for young viewers and older viewers as well  Plus mating is nature stop making a huge deal about it  All animals do it and alot sing to get a mate and keep the circle of life going,7
28577,728번,Happy Feet,8,Parents if youre are bringing your child to see this movie I think my opinion you should  Why You may ask because theyre children and  the adult jokes will just fly over their heads and they shouldnt be scared of the movie I read that in the parents review its a freaking kids movie Theres nothing to be afraid of And if they do get scared just wait until theyre older,5
28578,728번,Happy Feet,8,I saw this movie with my family at home and I just couldnt believe all the innuendos packed into this kids movie  It made me extremely uncomfortable  There was no reason for the filmmakers to include so much inappropriate stuff in what could have otherwise been an innocent fun kids movie  This stuff wont just fly over kids heads  Theyll be able to tell by their parents shocked faces that this isnt something they should be watching  DO NOT watch  Very disappointing  I really do think that the only people who should be watching this movie are adults or very mature teens   But even then who would want to watch it anyway Along with the innuendos there are also many racial stereotypes and the movie portrays humans as these monsters that are destroying the planet  All in all this movie is so filled with bad things that no kid will ever get the intended message of being yourself ,11
28579,728번,Happy Feet,8,This is a KIDS Movie  Bad Parents and some kids,2
28792,736번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,This film has an interesting storyline but I think its quite gory for younger kids  Ron coughs up slugs and words are painted in red on the walls  Also there is blood on the sword when Harry stabs the basilisk and blood flowing out when Harry stabs a book,3
28793,736번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,This movie is amazing and it is so cool to watch Harry find out more and more about the wizarding world  Another good thing is that the book is short so they can literally fit everything into the movie,2
28794,736번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,Yes I know only one scary bit and one cringey bit the scary bit is where the camera is shaking and Rons youngest sister was riting on the walls with blood and the cringey bit is the Phoenix pecking the eyes out of the snake  kinda of camera kinda not in a shadow I dont remember swear words they might be I dont remember and the whomping willow might scare some young kids and other Bits like Children being super scared by the snake including Collin and also Malloy gets hit on the head with a plank of wood and Ron gets sick and like spit slugs Because he had a broken wand and backfired also gildory Lockhart took his wand and he lost hes mind and never know who he was forever  he is a conman,1
28795,736번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,Chamber of Secrets is grossly underrated  This is a more bloody violent adventure but nonetheless one told beautifully,2
28796,736번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,This is ok to me it couldnt be any more innapropriate than the first,1
28797,736번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,It was a really good movie  You like it two But be careful because some scenes give me the wiggles because they are scary Right I hope you like it  Well bye dudes  I just love it when I fly in the ocean,7
28798,736번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,I preferred the movies while Chris Columbus was directing  They were kinda more childcentered  So 1 and 2 were easier to watch for me but I like all of them  There were a lot of funny things like Fred and Georges faces when they got yelled at for flying the car  And Rons when he got the Howler  The darker and scarier aspects arent that bad either  But nothing can beat the book and thats why theres four stars  There are great messages and role models like all the books and movies  And the violence is very light,9
28799,736번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,I really liked the book so I decided to watch the movie  I loved it although I pictured a lot of things differently in my head  There was a part near the end that was really scary  All the special effects were really cool But it is very long  Overall I think this is a good movie for families with kids 8 and up due to some scary scenes  Thanks for reading this review and I hope you try this movie,7
28800,736번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,It is not too scary but the last 15 minutes are scary you may want to skip the last 15 minutes,1
29010,737번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,I had it for movie night and me and my little brother both loved it  There were only a couple of nasty bits,2
29011,737번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,Read the book then see it  It is dark and not vary good fore under 13,2
29012,737번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,Really good movie but it leaves out a lot  Its a little scary someone cuts off his hand harry gets stabbed in the arm and a boy is killed so its definitely not for younger kids,2
29013,737번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,This is a great movie but there are a few scary scenes,1
29014,737번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,My sister watched this movie when she was 5 years old  If you watched Prisoner of Askaban you can certainly watch this movie  It is a great movie about teamwork and helping a friend in need  It does show an unconscious body and does have the killing curse in it  There are two final scenes in the film that you have to worry about  One includes Harry and a boys father screaming in peril after his son died  Another is that there is a scene SPOILER ALERT where mad eye moody turns back into his real form without the polyjuce potion and there is a brief moment where his transformation is disturbing  Other than those two I think youll be OK,8
29015,737번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,It is the BEST movie ever my little brother is 6 and never looked away Some intense scenes and suspense but amazing movie,2
29016,737번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,I think that the harry potter series are the best books ever written,1
29026,737번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,Not too much from the book version appeared in this movie  I was really looking forward to the veelas but guess what It got skipped Another major thing they left out were the characters Ludo Bagman and Winky the house elf   I think you should read the book first  Although many parts werent used this film was incredible and we all loved it  Nothing too scary at least not for me and my 5 year old brother,7
29027,737번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,This is a good movie  I watched the whole Harry Potter series when I was like 10  Watch it with you kids if you think theyll get too scared or skip over the bad parts  If things are inappropriate most likely your kids will not get it unless theyre old enough too  Parents sensor kids too much sometimes,5
29028,737번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,This movie is epic  I think there is to much violence for younger kids but not much blood,2
29029,737번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,Scary Most of this movie is kid appropriate but the end is very very scary Good movie though and kids 9  14 will enjoy it,3
29030,737번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,HARRY POTTER 4 contains mild violence  Thats all parents will need to know,2
29031,737번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,Although its a bit violent I think that kids will see this movie without your permission I recommend you to watch it with them so you can talk about the message in this movie instead of making them watched behind you backs that is way much worse than watching a bit of violence also kids have seen much more violence than in this movie,1
29032,737번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,I watched this with my family and I chose not to watch harry getting sliced of the cutting off the hand but honestly it wasnt that scary at all  My sister is 7 and she watched it all,2
29033,737번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,I think that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was too scary for my little brother who was 4 and was scared in his bed after watching  Spoiler alert The part with the dark lord was a very dark scene and when the dark lord came out of the cauldron it was too scary,2
29344,738번,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,Harry potter  and the HalfBlood prince book and movie was incredibly awesome We can relate a lot from Harry Potter and learn  great lessons from the series,2
29345,738번,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,but its ok for what it is  See you on a two parter review,2
29346,738번,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,I love the Harry Potter books but when it comes to the movies its a complete different story  Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince dived into more of a romance story  Sixteen year olds finding true love and all  But was it a good love story between Harry and Ginny in the movies No Seriously they made Ginny almost emotionless  Book Ginny would never do a thing like having awkward kiss moments and tie shoelaces at the weirdest moment  Not the actresss fault because she did what was on the script  Not just Ginny but Ron too  The screenwriter and director mustve hated Ron because now they give all the credit to Hermione for comforting Harry and Ron just sits there daydreaming at the last scene,10
29347,738번,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,I thing that this was a great movie It had a good plot line and everything  I saw this when I was about 11 or 10 and I loved it  Now I was reading some of the parent reviews and I thought that it was weird that they thought someone being killed on screen was bad  Now I get your point but it showed no blood or any odious sign that they were dead other than a lifeless body I think this is a great movie for kids 10 because of what I just described  Thanks for reading,7
29348,738번,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,I think 9 is fine if they are watching with a parent or someone above 12  This movie has violance but not to muchto be scared of  Their is some kissing but the plot is immpecable  I love this movie so much    its my favorite one  I think the whole harry potter franchise should be 10 it isnt bad at all,5
29349,738번,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,Harry Potter and the HalfBlood Prince is so good only one thing that scared me was the  Inferi   Dumbledores death was also a little scary but over all this is a good movie,3
29412,739번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,Should be watched  A bit of violence,2
29413,739번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,I hate this movie  It is very scary  DO NOT WATCH IT,3
29414,739번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,When writing the book this was my least favorite because to show Harrys puberty she spend hundreds of thousands of words just on the drama in Harrys emotions  But well skip to the movie,2
29415,739번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,I think this film is very fun to watch with families and has an intense storyline  Personally its one of my least favourites from the series but its still amazing  Should definitely watch,3
29416,739번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,Ohmygodsogood Even though it was darker than the previous films you find out more about Voldemort  Harry gets angry but his friends help him  Continues the recurring theme of friendship and defeating evil  Ron swears a loooot again but nothing too bad  Again soooo gooooood 10 at least very scary the death eaters and Voldemort kinda freaked me out but thats just me ,7
29417,739번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,This is a epic movie but there is quite a scary bit near the end with Lord Voldemort  but if you look closely he looks quite funny  There is a new character introduced called Luna Lovegood,2
29418,739번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,This movie is so good The tension started in the very begging and you want to watch more and more  This movie is appropriate for ages 8 and up  It is outrageous that CSM rated this film 12 and up,4
29419,739번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,Some violence and fantasy but overall its a great film and I love it   Good female role model in Hermione too,2

30405,752번,Hercules,7,Lighthearted but scary stuff is too much for littlest kids,1
30406,752번,Hercules,7,I have no Idea how adults come up with the gory and gruesome ratings They is simply animated figthing I think a two year old would find this scary,1
30407,752번,Hercules,7,This movie was incredible I really like the graphics and editing  I give it a 5star WHAT PARENTS NEED TO KNOW Its a great movie but not so much for young children  I would recommend at least 7 and older to watch  There are partial scenes where Herculess trainer Phil treats girls in a nonappropriate way  Although you cant get mad at Disney  The movie setting is located in ancient Greece so its very common to see things like that  There are scary scenes where Hades forces monsters and terrifying creatures to try to kill Hercules  Which they all end up failing  There is another scene where Hades tricks Hercules into saving two little boys trapped under a rock  The two little boys are actually Hadess helpers Pain and Panic  Of course Hercules ends up getting the rock off of them but then we see a huge monster appear out of the cave and Hercules ends up having to battle it  The monsters or so called Titans are released by Hades which then he makes them try to kill Zeus so he can rule  These monsters might come off as scary to some children  Throughout the whole movie there is no sign of blood  Just bruises and scratches  Some children might find it scary when people die  Their soul comes out of their body and sometimes screams  When Hades enters the underworld he has to feed this threeheaded dog  This might be scary  MY RECOMMENDATION If you are a child 6 years old or under please watch with parent supervision  Other than that it is my favorite movie and I definitely recommend watching it,24
30408,752번,Hercules,7,This Disney movie is   different,1
30409,752번,Hercules,7,A not sensitive kid could watch this  Hades is not scary because he is too funny I love his hair too lol  Hercules is tryna find where he belongs and then hes like GASP IMMA GOD or something and meets Meg  Shes disturbingly skinny btw but nice  The little narrator ladies are very cute  Phil chases ladies but hes cool  xd  You should watch One violent scene is when Hercules chops off a hydra head and then more grow back and he almost dies but you can skip over that little part  ,9
30410,752번,Hercules,7,So I love this movie a lot but its definitely not for younger kids  It had a great story but got really off topic from Greek mythology and could be offensive to that culture  The violence could be scary if a little kid watches it  Also Hercules boyfriend  the best Disney character in my opinion is very sexual and cracks some jokes that are funny but most kids wont understand  This movie has a lot of positive sides and good messages but the violence and sexuality might be too much for some kids,5
30411,752번,Hercules,7,Loved this film and its perseverance towards what it wants to be  Greek Gods is the way,2
30412,752번,Hercules,7,Very good Disney classic should be on the low end of PG  This movie is not light on peril and being scary  Not for the littlest to watch,3
30413,752번,Hercules,7,Im 15 and this has to be my favourite Disney  movie I have absolutely loved it to bits ever since I first saw it,2
30862,765번,Hocus Pocus,8,As a SUPER fan of Hocas Pocas is the best Halloween movie ever  As everyone has already said it has a lot of the word virgin thrown in  The witch gets a little cuddly with a bus driver but it is honestly not that bad and is comical  If your sensitive with gore you might think that witches talking about tourchering and sucking childrens souls out is bad  But even that is not bad at all  Scary funny and awesome,6
30863,765번,Hocus Pocus,8,Parents should know,1
30864,765번,Hocus Pocus,8,This is a great movie  I first watched it when I was 5 and my 3 year old brother watched it with me  Me and him both loved it  When I was little I didnt really remember them talking about virgin,4
30865,765번,Hocus Pocus,8,For most people Halloween is just Halloween but for some people in Salem Massachusetts its a bit more  The Sanderson sisters are a legend to the people in Salem  It is said that they sucked the life force out of kids to retain their youth  They were caught one day and were hung but it is said that a virgin will bring them back  This movie is a fun Halloween movie for the whole family  There is mild violence but I think most older kidstweens should be able to handle it  There is no sex but there are a few references to being a virgin and a few other mild sex innuendos  Most kids however would not notice it  Mild language is also present in the movie  All in all Hocus Pocus is a really cute movie  I definitely recommend it for anyone during the Halloween season,11
30866,765번,Hocus Pocus,8,This movies is about 3 witches who come back after 300 years when a boy lights a candle,1
30867,765번,Hocus Pocus,8,Hocus Pocus is an okay movie  I thought it was pretty funny and sometimes cool  The movie is about 3 kids who go to an old shack that belonged to three witches long ago  They light a candle and the witches come back to life wanting to suck childrens souls out to regain their youth  It is a fun adventure movie but can be scary at times  Fortunately the scariness is funny and not like the scariness in horror movies like Stephen Kings It,6
30868,765번,Hocus Pocus,8,There is alot of Sx cuz maxs little sister mentions something about something max said that is weird the Madonna outfit is also weird and an elderly couple get in a fight because one of them dances with the blonde witch,1
30869,765번,Hocus Pocus,8,I think this is a great film but wouldnt recommend it to people who dont want their child to ask what a virgin is because there i slot of talk about that  There is also a part when the kids try to burn the witches to death  I think that this is a great film and you should defiantly watch this,3
30870,765번,Hocus Pocus,8,It is really funny but there are some scary scenes like there is a zombie that gets his head torn off but still I think it is mostly funny and it is not very scary at all,1
31081,767번,Home Alone,8,This is a great comedy classic it includes violence and some language,1
31082,767번,Home Alone,8,0,1
31083,767번,Home Alone,8,so so good but there are burglurs and the sound of a gunshot and traps over all it is a great movie,1
31084,767번,Home Alone,8,Fun Movie  There is a spider  Some swearing like st bitch and ass,3
31085,767번,Home Alone,8,It is a great movie but too much swearing   WAY too much  but it  has a good moral,2
31086,767번,Home Alone,8,and i recommend it for all ages though the only bad effects is the fire and the iron and buckets though i bet young viewers would laugh,1
31087,767번,Home Alone,8,Super funny holidaythemedslapstickcomedymovie  Great main character and creative plot  Some of the slapstick parts might be disturbing to really young kids,3
31088,767번,Home Alone,8,Super funny language is fine and the violence is funny   Honestly this is the best holiday movie ever,2
31089,767번,Home Alone,8,GREAT,2
31123,767번,Home Alone,8,It is a great movie and all with funny humor and situations but even with actually especially with the first say ten minutes there is a lot of disrespect going on in the Mccalister home I probably spelled that wrong  No body seems to like Kevin as they call him names like disease jerk le incompetent and so on  There are a few mild swearing as well  Its really not hard to see why they hate Kevin because hes really a brat  He gets angry about stupid things and even calls his mom dummy and comments Families suck He of course learns his lesson and for the rest of the movie the swearing is taken down a notch as well as the insults  The traps he sets for the burglars are comical but sometimes very painful to watch  Most kids might laugh at it but others might just cover their eyes  Overall I think its a good movie just be careful what age you decide to show it to,9
31124,767번,Home Alone,8,This movie is quite violent at the end with the villains getting burned hit in the head falling down stairs and more  I first watched this when i was six and I was terrified of it  Lots of namecalling and some swearing but there arent any movies without that these days  Ive watched it about ten times none of them because I had to watch it in school or anything and I only watched the Grinch  liveaction twice once in school  Not the best role models but Kevin does tend to be quite independant,5
31125,767번,Home Alone,8,Words like Hll ss And Dmn  If your kid has heard these words its fine  If not maybe skip it  They also say Shut up Les incompetent Your kids probably wouldnt understand that Stupid and say Ya filthy animal ,4
31126,767번,Home Alone,8,This movie is really funny and its one of my favs  There isnt a lot of cursing but there is one scene where Santa is smoking a cigarette  It gets violent a little more than half way through the movie but its the best Part A must see,4
31127,767번,Home Alone,8,Great Family Christmas movie probably saw it the first time when I was 6 years old  There is a lot of comedic violence and a few scenes where 8 year old Keven looks at his 14 year old brother Buffs Playboy magazines  But other than that a great funny entertaining movie the entire family will enjoy,3
31128,767번,Home Alone,8,This film is so funny  It has cartoonish violence and slapstick comedy  I watch this most Christmass and I never get bored of it  It has occasional use of mild swearing and may be unsuitable for younger children  Love this film,6
31129,767번,Home Alone,8,This is a mustwatch Watch this movie you will cry for how funny it is This is a great movie for kids  family Although if your child is scared of bad guys sneaking into the house they may want to wait longer because that is what happens although Kevin the main character beats them up and tries to get rid of them in funny ways,4
31130,767번,Home Alone,8,To be honestthis movie is really funny Nothing is really major except for language,2
31131,767번,Home Alone,8,it is a great  film for kid 11    It is a comedy that is so funny  it will knock your socks of it has violence language  and no sex  you better watch  soon,4
31132,767번,Home Alone,8,A great Christmas  classic  It includes funny fails  Tricky traps and endless fun Beware of the language Kevin is mean at first  We dont like when he calls his mom a bad name   Good for responsible 8 year olds,7
31133,767번,Home Alone,8,Fun and quick witted Caper that will introduce kids to more advanced Heist movies,1
31134,767번,Home Alone,8,This movie is a survival story about being left home  Kevin the main character had an annoying family and wanted to be home alone  The next day the family left home for Paris in a hurry but forgot Kevin  He began to learn what life was like alone along with the pesky Wet Bandits  At the end the family returned and everyone was happy,5
31135,767번,Home Alone,8,This is not a bad movie  I love this movie but their is so much profanity I feel like it cannot be just flown by like it is no big deal  The way the parents and the kids talk to each other is unacceptable I would still watch it but mute some of the parts where you can tell profanity can happen,4
31136,767번,Home Alone,8,Fantastic funny Christmas classic,1
31137,767번,Home Alone,8,Home Alone is an awesome movie  It isnt violent except for when the kid is fighting two burglars  It has one scary part where his furnace makes a creepy noise  There is also some mild cursing  Other then that it is fine for your kid 8 and up,5
31138,767번,Home Alone,8,A lot of humor but it can be very scary and inappropriate scenes If you dont like swearing and violence you shouldnt watch this movie,1
31139,767번,Home Alone,8,Age Rating My Opinion  PG  13 A,1
31140,767번,Home Alone,8,this was a great movie but can be violent including guns creepy movies  And very frequent language,2
31455,780번,Hotel Transylvania,6,This movie is really good I think that its hilarious and it has a really good message Ok so violencetheres really no violence besides the scary face thing that dracula does  Sexy stuff none besides two TINY kisses  Language none  Consumerism none  Drinking none  Great movie ,9
31456,780번,Hotel Transylvania,6,Greta movie for all families  I went to see this movie with my family and I thought This is gonna be a stupid little kid movie   But the movie was awesome  I normally enjoy a good PG13 comedy but this was an awesome movie  And a shout out to autisticcaregvr Really You have nothing better to do You make it sound like paranormal activity or a slasher movie Parents Do not listen to his review  This movie was meant to be a movie about a coming of age movie  Not a demonic movie,9
31457,780번,Hotel Transylvania,6,This is a cute movie but the kids 5 and under might not get he humor  There is some love not an overdose more like Disney Princess and a lot of stars in this movie The reason why I put language is because of the slight potty humor  teeheehee but at least the boys will be happy Overall a really sweet family movie and a great addition to the movie collection,3
31458,780번,Hotel Transylvania,6,Vampires Bloodsuckers only make appearances in Rrated and PG13rated movies  Ive never seen a vampire movie for kids but I didnt like it  Sexy and I Know It by LMFAO is played in some scenes and I despise LMFAO,5

31463,780번,Hotel Transylvania,6,dracula was funnymavis is hotjohnathan can be annoying at times and the other characters were generally likeable except for the witches and especially the stupidugly unappealing zombies,1
31464,780번,Hotel Transylvania,6,It is a really good movie   It is really funny  I saw it two times and it even made my parents laugh out loud   My mom covered my eyes when she saw kissing   I took her hands off my eyes   There is a little story where there is fire   Also the mom in the movie gets killed but the dad remains alive   There is some scary music   For little kids there might be some scary parts but otherwise I think it is a really good movie,9
31573,788번,How to Train Your Dragon,7,This movie is great for kids with imagination or really anyone  It serves as a reminder that social outcast is no good and shows some kickass dragons along the way  If you havent seen it yet I dont know what your doing Give it a watch with your kid or by yourself you wont regret it,4
31574,788번,How to Train Your Dragon,7,I think that for 10 and up This shows a lot of caring and kind  It is also good for history,2

31579,788번,How to Train Your Dragon,7,I have been watching this movie since it came out when I was four years old  I really like that even when every viking expected the main character to kill a dragon he was brave and refused to do it  There was a cheesy crush that the main character had on a girl  The three minor things that I would warn about are 1  Teens talk about the scars they hope to get by battling dragons  2  The main characters Dad gifts him a helmet made from his Mothers old breastplate  3  There were some filler words like the common sense review said such as Thor almighty  I recommend this great movie to anybody who is thinking about watching it,10
31580,788번,How to Train Your Dragon,7,The end was scary so if you have any little kids ask them if they need to take a break   It has some sad parts but this is a kids movie so it will have a happy ending,2
31986,804번,Ice Age,8,The movie was terrible for me  I think it is only suitable for under 5 year olds who dont understand it and over 8 year olds who are already older  I was very sad about some scenes  I will never forget the movie,4

31991,804번,Ice Age,8,I will says that is some but jokes but they will mostly hear those butt joke in daycare and school   The are some insane seen   It will teach your kid to trust and working together   Also have reabiltiy to trust again   It is aslo teach kids to not follow in peer preasure  It is funny    I will say it will be good starting shows for those who are learning to talk   It is always better to start earlier    I think those you rate 18 and plus are insane   The seen is a right amount of violence   I am okay to allow the acess with all kids   I seen many parents not supervising the kids and this how crazy you are so dont blame on you   It is better to keep this acess to kids and safe enviroment   I will mind keep your opion and my opion in oppositions    I think this will kids the improtant of trust  workship  teamword  and different meanings of family or herd or flock or school  fish   My 2nd grade teacher said  We are family and spread to school like a wild fire after from the ice age and we litimed to only one bully but he is not as bad as normal school bullys in other countries and states   It stay with also new added motto which is pretty similar to we are family   By the end of the day  We all are just the same  like water and rain,18
31992,804번,Ice Age,8,Very good movie,1
31993,804번,Ice Age,8,Ice Age is one of those newer classics   My brother and I love Sid the sloth a lot  He just cracks us up We also like when Diego says Wheres the baby There he is   It was peekaboo   I still feel bad for Manny that he lost his parents to humans but this movie is SO good  I understand why it got 82 in the reviews,7
31994,804번,Ice Age,8,Parents can know that i like this film  It is amazing Especially if you are a Wooly Mammoth or a Giant Ground Sloth  I know you will like it   oh and by the way it was swell if you like california where they made the film  Bye earthlings  Im just so excited for my next review  My aliens and earthlings I bid you well  Oh and bye the way i like you  Bye,10
31995,804번,Ice Age,8,As of 2020 there are five Ice Age movies and with the fifth being a failure it doesnt look like it will continue anytime soon,1
31996,804번,Ice Age,8,Nobody should ever have to lay eyes on that monstrosity of a baby,1
31997,804번,Ice Age,8,DO NOT let your children watch this terrible movie it truly is an abomination  The Ice Age Baby is maybe the worst thing ever and teaches a terrible messages  Parents should not even watch this they would  probably die,3
31998,804번,Ice Age,8,I enjoy this film and think the cgi holds up  Has some violence but overall an enjoyable story that the family can watch  I thought it was good but surprised how big the franchise is now,3
31999,804번,Ice Age,8,This movie is one of the best movie I seen on 2001 Its so unique and it really put the message out and what do you do for a family or your friends that you protect them from danger I think this is a really nice message to this and the movie is so awesome and the best I have seen when I was young,3
32000,804번,Ice Age,8,Its a toddler movie theres no other way to put it  But the reason for 5 stars is because its one of them special kids movies that all ages can watch  Be curious with toddlers of 2 or under though there is some scary scenes,3
32001,804번,Ice Age,8,I like this movie  It is about animals adventure,2
32002,804번,Ice Age,8,Sort of cute movie but Manny is so annoying  Its a pretty cliche movie  Manny reminds me of Calliou and it sounds like his nose is clogged up the whole time    I strongly dislike this movie but the other ones are ok  Sid is just gross he makes me naseous but    MANNY RUINS IT ALL Do not watch,6
32003,804번,Ice Age,8,okay this was one of the most boringest movies of all time its just so stupid dont watch this stupid movie I shut it off in the first 30 minutes  dont waste your money or time watching this,2
32004,804번,Ice Age,8,Title says all,1
33166,825번,Inside Out,8,When I saw the trailerI thought it was boringbut my parents really wanted to watch the movie in theatersso we went there to watch the movie and let me tell youit was amazing I watched it like 3 times now thanks to Netflix  I Like the Animation and story because it just explores your inner emotionsand family  I had a few giggles and laugh but also a little tear at the end  I Highly recommend it to all families World wide Because its my favorite Pixar Movie So far,6
33167,825번,Inside Out,8,Cute with kind and friendly characters,1
33168,825번,Inside Out,8,Some mild swearing such as stupid idt etc  and unkindness  One scene involves Riley shouting shut up at her parents,3
33169,825번,Inside Out,8,Do you really want to teach your childern to get bad habits like swearing when they are angry Would you want them to learn sexist stereotypes trust me you do not want to watch time movie,2
33170,825번,Inside Out,8,Completely appropriate for almost any age  Beautiful animation good lesson  I love this movie,3
33171,825번,Inside Out,8,If it is not as good as Toy Story 3 or Lion King it is a close 3rd or 2nd this is one of my favorite films  Kids will love the colorful backgrounds and funny humor and middle and older people will love the powerful messages and jokes  Best Pixar film you can watch it now,3
33172,825번,Inside Out,8,I thought it was a good movie it was fun funny and also has a good message that both kids and adults can understand and like even if the message is deep  One part that parents might want to know about is one of the core memories include a babys bum being showed with her diaper on her head  It is only shown for a couple seconds as her goofball island part of herself,3
33173,825번,Inside Out,8,Inside Out is pretty good but sometimes I just think about it like I do with The Good Dinosaur and think    why Dont get me wrong it is a good movie and had good scenes here and there but the whole idea of Inside Out is just weird  It is still kind of creative but I feel like this was the point that Pixar was running out of ideas  It also raises some unanswered questions  The emotions are in peril throughout the movie but that raises the question Can they die If they die how would that effect Riley Bing Bong died so does that mean the emotions could die  Another question I thought was near the end  In the end the mind workers installed a new console for Rileys teen years  It raised the question What happened when they took out Rileys old console That just feels weird and dark  Even though this was Pixars meh its still better than a LOT of Pixar films  Toy Story A Bugs Life Monsters Inc  Finding Nemo The Incredibles Toy Story 3 Cars 2 and Monsters University were ALL worse films than Inside Out  Still Pixar didnt need to make this  If they were gonna make it they couldve at least added more to it,13
33174,825번,Inside Out,8,I watched this movie and I think its good but BingBong Rileys imaginary friend that is not an emotion in the movie gets forgotten and at the end and all the Emotions are happy but noone knows what happens to BingBong and if hes even happy  Noone knows if Joy kept her promise  I think its quite sad and probably for 9 yrs  up a bit too sad for small kids  It shows what puberty could be like and it kind of scared me  Also there is talk about using swear words plus there is a bit of puberty stuff  I found that the part when Riley decides to LEAVE HOME which I found SCARY is too much for little kids to process  One last thing is that there is one scene is where toddler Riley shows her bum to everyone who is watching  DONT SHOW TO LITTLE KIDS,9
34297,837번,Iron Man,8,My brother and I where covering our eyes the entire time,2
34298,837번,Iron Man,8,AmazingOne of the best MCU movies there are,1
34299,837번,Iron Man,8,I love this movie Iron Man is my favorite Marvel character  He is a playboy so there is some suggestive stuff he says but it would probably go over their heads  There is one scene where they are rolling around in bed but nothing is shown and it is quick and skips to morning  There is swearing but not too much for a mature kid  And the violence is not too bad again for a mature kid,5
34300,837번,Iron Man,8,Yeah there is some violence and me and my older sister did have to skip the part where Tony and Christine are in bed but I would say its a great film Also I kind of disagree with what Common Sense Media had to say about the bad guys being clearly evil in regards to Obadiah Stane because at first glance hes a very nice man who cares for and wants to help Tony  Nevertheless this is a very great movie indeed,3
34301,837번,Iron Man,8,I think that iron man is a good movie but it was kind of boring in the middle  I didnt see this one first but it was good  Violence was kind of heavy with a few deaths and blood and a shooting  Sex wasnt much beside the part where the main character has a hookup,4
34302,837번,Iron Man,8,Iron Man was a amazing movie Rdj Robert Downey Jr does an amazing turn on iron man  Some innuendo as flirting bare backs kissing and assumed sex  Violence is very realistic with terrorism kids held at gunpoint torture among Tony Stark and terrorists  Some alcohol drunken at parties and Tony Stark drinks whiskey very frequently  Tony gambles and flirts at a casino  Iron mans suit is packed full of tank missiles lasers and machine guns  Tony best friend betrays him and uses his technology against him  Overall amazing comic book film with violence and some innuendo,9
34303,837번,Iron Man,8,I personally love this movie  Its not horribly violent though there are some scenes that I would not recommend a younger kid see  Its funny too  A great movie to watch if youre new the Marvel universe,4
34304,837번,Iron Man,8,As the first movie in the MCU this one is a favorite for most  It relies less on CGI and more on true facetoface fight scenes  Very stylish  Of course Robert Downey Jr  is the PERFECT man to play the part  Violence isnt too bad but enough to keep the plot rolling  Humor at its finest  Language was mild mostly strong at some parts  Sex was iffy girls wearing croptops and lingerie when drinking with Tony Stark and a few crude statements nothing that would make your kids questions anything  Tony has a reputation as a playboy  Drinking is recreational and mild Tony gets drunk comical but still drunk  A couldbe frightening medical scene  I loved this movie and your kids will too,12
34305,837번,Iron Man,8,Parents need to know that iron man is a superhero movie that starts it all the MCU  Like all superhero movies there is definitely some intense violence with lots of punching and high tech machines and gun use  There is also quite a bit of war violence on the other hand  There is one scene around 35 seconds of iron man and a random girl making out and implied that they   yeah  Then later appears with barely any clothes  This makes sense later why they put more language and less sexy stuff  Some very mild language including damn one possible a and hell  But he is iron man very funny but may be a iffy choice for young kids Lots of products placements and marvel merchandising,9
35011,848번,It,8,I watched this movie for the first time just the other day and i anticipated it to be very scarybut i was wrongthe only major bad things are some blood and thats a given with scary movies Also with the swearingyes there are kids swearing but my dad told me that kids would swear in the 80s all of the timewhich is where its set in I am very sensitive to scary stuff because of my anxiety and this was ok for meso just dont watch it if you are a sensitive person,1
35012,848번,It,8,Right off the bat Im going to say that I say 13 because I watched with friends  My review would probably be different if I watched it alone  I found it kind of scary but being with my friends made it easier  If I were alone Id probably be making this 14 or something  The story is so good and the casting is amazing  Eddie is a sweetheart Ritchie is a king Beverly is a queen and Bill is sweetiepie  Mike and the other dude are kind of lame  Its much less inappropriate than the book  I totally recommend   This was one of my first horror movies and boy was it a great one,10
35013,848번,It,8,This review has no spoilers  This movie was great and as a horror fan it was even better  I didnt put spoilers in this because i definitely suggest you watch this movie for yourself  Its funny scary kinda suspensful and overall enjoyable  If your over ten and you dont mind scares this is the movie for you,5
35014,848번,It,8,I was wreally swary I took my 2 year old to see it and they said Best movie EVER  Favourite character was for sure the gay kid he was INSPIWING,2
35015,848번,It,8,I watched it when I was 11 I thought it was pretty good if your child is scared easily id wait a few years  I love the movie and watch it quite often  Pennywise is a bit creepy for people who do not like clowns  But I would still recommend If you have not watched already I would watch the only part that I wouldnt want little kids to see is when one of the bullys stabs his dad in the neck after pennywise tells him too,5
35016,848번,It,8,If you say its not scary okay youre fine I hated this movie rude characters young teens say swear words Georgies arm was bitten by Pennywise and a abusing teen girl named Beverley  Pennywise is an Alien dressed up as a clown not his species is a clown  Imagine that It was a SciFi horror movie  These clowns are creepy or not too creepy Not for school people  These creators dont know when they can allowed to say swear words  I thought it was PG13 but its R  It has tons of blood and gore  I love Halloween but this was so trash If you love this movie then shame on you Just stop loving this movie Maybe Rebecca Spark will probably hate this,12
35017,848번,It,8,Honestly I dont know who would want to watch such movies  The creepy Halloween decorations they have out in the stores scares ME a little still but Im just a sensitive teen,2
35018,848번,It,8,The origonal IT is ok for kids but not the new one because  it to violent there you go dudes,1
35019,848번,It,8,yes  IT wouldnt be the best movie to pick if your afraid of clowns but if your not I think IT would be perfect the movie is about 7 outcasts who got bullied previously  fighting this bully but then one of there brothers Georgie denbrough  bills brother goes missing  taken from pennywise the 7 losers go out searching for Georgie and fighting pennywise  the contest behind the movie is to be who you want to be and know that you dont have to be popular to be the star  I will say throughout the movie there is a lot of language and talk on health and there isnt a lot of blood  the movie has the perfect amount of horror and comedy  I personally love the film with a passion,3
35020,848번,It,8,This movie is great except for the language I think thats why they rated it R  Violence is like in a superhero movie and the little bit of sexual content is supposed to be comical,1
35245,850번,James and the Giant Peach,8,Ive seen some kidsteens say its one of the worst movies  Okay I can respect that Holly R says this movie is just creepy,3
35246,850번,James and the Giant Peach,8,These reviews you see around you are by a bunch of snowflakes who cant take anything slightly scary  For me this is a classic Ive loved since I was 4 and something that families will be happily watching together  Everything is great from the visuals the character design the stopmotion animation the simple but fun songs and great messages of family friendship and conquering your fears  This movie managed to elevate and expand upon the original book that Ill always see this as the definitive version of the story  Same with director Selicks other triumphant classics of Coraline and The Nightmare Before Christmas,5
35247,850번,James and the Giant Peach,8,This movie was terrible It was so boring,1
35248,850번,James and the Giant Peach,8,Its on the older side of animation but overall and funny movie great for kids 8  This movies does contain the word ass but thats about it for language  Can scare young or sensitive children  Very little sexual references the centipede flirts with the spider repetitively there is also a scene where the cricket asks the centipede its longitude and latitude but the centipede mistakes the question as asking him the size of his yknow  The centipede replies to the cricket with thats very personality information,5
35249,850번,James and the Giant Peach,8,Ive loved this movie since I saw it when I was 8,1
35250,850번,James and the Giant Peach,8,I like this movie but I dont think it is appropriate for kids 9 because the aunts try to kill James with an axe and they also abuse him,1
35251,850번,James and the Giant Peach,8,As a Tim Burton fan i think the movie was awsome a piece of art,1
35252,850번,James and the Giant Peach,8,Okay so first let me say the book is AMAZING  Fun heartwarming and just weird enough to be memorable  The movie though   ugh  First the beginning is TERRIFYING  I wasnt allowed to watch this when I was little and I see why  I mean a giant rhinoceros appears from the sky and basically murders a kids parents leaving him in the hands of his abusive and repulsive aunts  Family entertainment at its best  And the rest of the movie just doesnt make sense  I fell asleep partway through and when I woke up they were   in space And yet I honestly dont feel like I missed out on much  Even the songs are weird somewhat tuneless and add nothing to the plot  I USUALLY love Tim Burton movies but this one was just a disappointment  I only gave it that extra star because the grasshopper glow worm and centipede are hilarious and add just a little whimsy to an otherwise unsettling and skippable movie,13
35253,850번,James and the Giant Peach,8,A great movie but the Aunts are really mean and we dont like that bit but I know that its only for he movie and they arent like that in real life and they are just acting  I really like when James is in the peach and having the adventures,2
35254,850번,James and the Giant Peach,8,This movie was great   I would have to say that the bugs arent really creepy but thats just my opinion   The movie was an interesting kind of weird   My brother who is 6 says the movie was good and actiony,4
35410,854번,Jaws,8,this movie is not scary  I heard that some people were afraid to have a BATH after this movie what  there is only a little blood and the scariest thing was hoping my mom would not come in on those parts,3
35411,854번,Jaws,8,So many parents who watched it in their day  Talk this movie up so much  It is not scary and I think a baby could handle this  But some things to realise is that their are complete idiots in this movie and I know people allergic to jerks  If you thought that was real you shouldnt be thinking about watching jaws ,4
35412,854번,Jaws,8,Jaws although being old is very scary  There are TONS of graphic shark attacks including a man being eaten alive while he screams in agne and spits up blood  There is also a scene where a sunken boat is found and a dead mans head appears without an eye  Although it isnt that realistic it is incredibly disturbing  The first scene also shows a girl getting naked and then jumping into the water  Jaws is violent but one of the best movies I have ever seen,6
35413,854번,Jaws,8,This was a fantastic movie Im not a fan of anything bloody but I really did enjoy watching it I think you should wait until 11 or 12 depending on what you can handle  The first scene in the movie is a girl who is attacked by a shark and then a child does which is really sad and we do see some remains of a shark victim that is disturbing dead people and a really disturbing scene of a man tragically be torn to bits by a shark on a boat but other than these things it isnt too horrible  A few jump scares but nothing sexual or to harsh  I just think parents should watch with their children but other than that a pretty good movie,6
35414,854번,Jaws,8,I think Jaws is a really good movie to watch with family  It can be a little scary at times but it is over all not that scary  There is not that much gore or very graphic deaths  I think it is a great movie but if your kid is more scared of the ocean and sharks then I would say this movie is not for them,4
35415,854번,Jaws,8,This movies special effects are amazing  The first time I watched this movie I didnt really know what to expect but I actually thought that everything in the movie couldve actually happened  This movie does show blood and people by the shark though the blood is basically only in the water  The movie also shows the characters drinking   I think this movie should probably be watched by 12 because there are a lot of kids who arent exposed to certain things like drinking till theyre older  Over all I think this is an amazing movie 1010 would recommend,6
35416,854번,Jaws,8,Jaws is an excellent shark film but be aware there is blood violence and smoking  This classic movie does not disappoint as Steven Spielberg movies never do There are a few bloody attack moments but not all shark attacks show blood as well as some few intense jump scare moments that may be to intense for younger viewers  Overall its a great movie to watch,4
35417,854번,Jaws,8,This is a GREAT classic film  This film In my opinion Is suitable for kids 11 and up  There is some blood and gore but otherwise it should be just fine as long as your kids dont get frightened too easily,3
35418,854번,Jaws,8,Great horror movie about the hunt for a deadly great white shark,1
35419,854번,Jaws,8,This an amazing movie and I really do think anyone who is mature,1
36049,870번,Jurassic Park,8,Jurassic Park is a movie about an island that is inhabited by dinosaurs that are kept in cages and enclosures  The dinosaurs were brought back by dna found in a bug that was encased in amber  The park gets visitors and during this tour the power gets cut and dinosaurs go rampant taking over the park and killing scientists and tourists  Alan is one of these tourists and he starts using his skillset to keep two children alive while they fight to get the dinosaurs back in containment,4
36050,870번,Jurassic Park,8,I think this movie is great and that the dinosaurs are done really well  There is a lot of action and a few bloody scenes but nothing that bad,2
36051,870번,Jurassic Park,8,This is a great movie It might be a little scary at points but that just adds to the suspense action and terror Some violent areas like a man getting eaten off a toilet and a severed arm on a womans shoulder  Overall a GREAT movie though Hope you enjoy,6
36052,870번,Jurassic Park,8,jurassic park is a movie that has dinosaurs in a park that shows what they look like and how they act but they get fre and take over the island,1
36053,870번,Jurassic Park,8,Where do I even begin Its amazing  The plot is amazingly original the characters are very enjoyable and than theres the action  Where do I begin The Dinosaurs look AMAZING and the action is excellent creative and amazingly exciting  The acting is spectacular  I cant even put it into words how good the actors did  Flawless,8
36054,870번,Jurassic Park,8,Must see I bet you parents seen this but you are not sure for kids well easy there is chomping the main bad guy Denis died not at the end you think the TRex is bad but you relies the tRex is good and saves the day by eating 4 raptors and the best  classic WHEN DINOS ROARED THE  EARTH banner falls when the tRex roars  A car chase happens and just to say its a exiting scary story that will fill any body up with exiting action even if you hate dinosaurs as you they roared the earth once and not fully a dinosaur movie,2
36055,870번,Jurassic Park,8,Iv seen both Jurassic Park and JawsI personally think JAWS is a little bit better and like both of them  It is intense with some body parts falling off but fine for kids 10,2
36056,870번,Jurassic Park,8,This movie is one of works of the legendary director Stephen Spielberg and special effects designer Stan Winston the made behind the Terminator Jaws Edward Scissorhands and many more  The movie was released to the world in 1993  Based on the novel by Michael Crichton published in 1990 this movie is a watch for the whole family  It was filmed in Kauai one of the Hawaiian Islands,4
36057,870번,Jurassic Park,8,I loved this movie had violence but not so bad and langauge and drinking and smoking and a half naked girl in her bra and panties,1
36111,870번,Jurassic Park,8,This is a very entertaining movie as well scary but not that scary  I really enjoyed this movie my 7 year old sister was a bit scared at some points but I think its fine  I personally think 9 is a,3
36112,870번,Jurassic Park,8,Jurassic Park is about a theme park full of dinosaurs  Before it can go public it needs to be proven safe by a lawyer a mathematician and 2 dinosaur experts  The grandkids of the parks creator also tag along for the ride  And as you might expect everything goes wrong,4
36113,870번,Jurassic Park,8,I watched this movie when I was 7 and it was fine  If your trying to find a movie to watch with your family pick this Only part that may be frightening for young children is when the tRex eats the guy off a toilet LOL,3
36114,870번,Jurassic Park,8,I think this movie should have been rated M or PG 13 cause some scenes may be a bit scary  Also towards the end it swung to close to the horror genre,2
36115,870번,Jurassic Park,8,Jurassic Park is a movie classic with peril and slim to none gory violence  The story is about archaeologists that get a opportunity to work at a dinosaur theme park but when a monsoon rolls into the island the dinosaurs in habitat escape  Lots of dinosaur jump scares but most kids and pre teens would be able to handle it  Characters use tranquilizer guns as well as machine guns  Dinks kill each other and humans through biting venom saliva spit and pouncing onto humans dinos  A character loses a arm and scares a main character which could be scary to younger kids  Kids get electrocuted and are in peril through the movie  Mild cursing such as son of a btch sht and damn  Overall great movie that older Kids and pre teens will love,9
36116,870번,Jurassic Park,8,the is a brilliant movie but also good for younger kids because it could never happen in real life  highly reccomended as long as your kid is not too sensitive  there are positive adult role models  enjoy,4
36117,870번,Jurassic Park,8,Great movie but not for young children,1
36118,870번,Jurassic Park,8,The Movie includes alot of scifi violence  There are scenes where dinosaurs kill people but it is not gory  Also some language Samuel L  Jackson so it is not for small ones  Great for 1015 year old,4
36119,870번,Jurassic Park,8,Parents need to know that this amazing film by Steven Spielberg is amazing  There is definitely lots of violence some of it quite gruesome involving a severed arm  Lots of terror as well and some language including a few ST and hells and damns and more  Positive role models and messages and helping them from dying of course and some product placements and of screen merchandising,4
36137,870번,Jurassic Park,8,The classic Jurassic Park is a great movie with some fake animal violence,1
36138,870번,Jurassic Park,8,Jurassic park is a good movie with some blood children in constant peril and realistic dinosaurs  Overall fine for tweens,2
36139,870번,Jurassic Park,8,Astounding film filled with epic and memorable scenes  A great first PG13 film for kids,2
36140,870번,Jurassic Park,8,Jurassic Park is the ultimate combination of great acting terrific special effects and a script that really couldnt get any greater than it is  Since that script is about dinosaurs eating people it can be a very intense movie for some  I wouldnt call it scary as there isnt more than one true jumpscare but the rest of the intense scenes are played out very realistically with a real sense of grittiness and peril  The most brutal scene involves a man getting eaten whole by a T rex but as with all the other scenes theres not much blood  Language never goes too vulgar goddamn son of btch hell one big pile of sht etc  and even at that its few and far inbetween,6
36141,870번,Jurassic Park,8,All the Jurassic Park movies are amazing but this one is by far the best  Older tweens and teens should be able to handle it  The dinosaurs are very realistic and might scare some younger kids but if they can handle scary things then they should be fine  Theres a lot of violence most if it isnt too bloody but it can still get a bit gruesome  The swearing is pretty mild for a PG13 movie at least compared to more recent PG13 movies it is  The swearing is mostly hell and damn with sht in there once or twice as well as religious profanity like oh my God etc  As long as kids know that dinosaurs arent real and scientists arent going to bring them back they should be fine,7
36142,870번,Jurassic Park,8,Whoever cab87670 is They are a liar,1
36143,870번,Jurassic Park,8,This movie was the best but I dont think anyone under 14 should watch it it has some blood and gore lots of violence swearing and frightening scenes we also see a bloody animal leg land on a car  Its not your average dinosaur movie  But for 14 and up its awesome,3
36144,870번,Jurassic Park,8,great classic spielberg film violence may disturb younger audiences and the swearing is a little much,1
36145,870번,Jurassic Park,8,I watched it with my papaw and i thought it was really good One of my favorite movies overall  The parts i would look into was that When the goat was gone A bloody legarm of a goat landed on the car  The second part is when The girl goes to the shack to get the power to come back on she runs because the raptor chases her and mr arnolds arm slides out on her shoulder she walks forwards and its his arm that had been bit off and was very bloody  they say a few cuss words like 2 or three they say sh and bi,5
36156,870번,Jurassic Park,8,This is a spectacular movie  The special effects of this movie are astounding and the dinosaurs are extremely realistic   the first thirty or forty minutes of this movie are mostly touring the park which some kids may find boring and want to stop the movie   But make sure they stick with it  because this movie turns into a fantastic thrill ride with suspense aplenty   In this classic thriller characters are almost always in danger   People are killed in this movie but most of the violence is not bloody in fact most of the deaths are not even fully shown   Only for or five people die in the entire movie   There are only two slightly violent scenes in which a goats leg is thrown on a window by a dinosaur and when a decapitated and rather fake looking arm is grabbed by a character which she drops almost immediately and is not shown again   Some blood is shown but it is mostly just scrapes and cuts on the people who survive   Language is scarce and I thought that this film was not scary at all but younger viewers may disagree   Overall I would say that this movie is a great family film and you only might want to preview it  for extremely young and sensitive children,11
36157,870번,Jurassic Park,8,Jurassic Park is a classic fun film for older kids  This film brings awe and wonder with its nice use of animatronic and CGI dinosaurs but with that brings terror and violet imagery  Even as  a mostly blood and goreless film expect character deaths from dinos big and small  While most deaths arent graphic or are done off screen there is one main exception with a scene involving a large dino that jumpscares you and a severed arm landing on another character  Even with the lack of extreme violence its still an intense movie involved peril and pursuit throughout   Sexual content is limited with the main one being a woman in a bikini on one of the staff members computers  Language is moderate with usual curses and 12 uses of the word st  Overall you really have to know your kid  Some kids may be fine with the violence but think its too scary  Others might not like some of the mildlyintense death scenes  I recommend you give it a viewing before letting your kid see it,10
36158,870번,Jurassic Park,8,This is truly one of the greatest movies ever although the violence is high there a severed arm shown and some swearing to also people are eaten and a mans face is eaten off screen but you see the raptor on the guy getting eaten a man is eaten off of a toilet and a bloody leg is shown but overall its a must see movie,1
36159,870번,Jurassic Park,8,This movie is definitely strong at some points and weak at others  I felt like in the first act of the movie was dull boring horribly written and not well acted but the second act was absolutely great It had amazing peril and just what i was looking for out of this movie but act three didnt get off that lucky because it gets worse by a bit but overall definitely a movie people should see,3
36160,870번,Jurassic Park,8,Really nothing to worry about  I watched it when I was six I was more fascinated then frightened  Parents Its good to let kids watch cool scifi violence and know a good movie to recommend and discuss with friends Its actually imaginationbuilding and not letting them watch movies can leave them very behind when theyre older Not appropriate for momsthough   My friends parents wouldnt let her watch Harry Potter when she was younger and now shes so set back on all the new action movies everyones talking about at school and very depressed about it,6
36161,870번,Jurassic Park,8,The movie Jurassic Park is about an islandamusement park with  living dinosaurs  This movie is a classicactionscience fiction movie  The movie centers around two paleontologist that are asked to come see the park by its founder and creator  This movie is about dinosaurs that look very realistic this could be frightening for younger viewers  Characters swear  frequently throughout and one main character smokes throughout the movie  Overall this is a very exciting and well made film  I think it would be great for 13 and up depending on the maturity of the 13 year old,7
36162,870번,Jurassic Park,8,Good film but definitely not for little children  I tried to show it to my 6 year old brother and he got bored at the start  Then I remembered the about the dinosaurs and turned it off   Not that scary but you need a good attention span to pay attention te some of the dialogue at the start   It is not a 12 or it would be a 12 on the box I watched this when I was 10 and that was a good age  Its a PG,5
36163,870번,Jurassic Park,8,I watched this movie a year or two ago and I still love it to today  This movie is pretty fake but worth watching  The dinosaurs I have an exception for the incredibly realistic giants that are the main reason of this movie,3
36164,870번,Jurassic Park,8,theres some swearing like sht crap hell  damn son of a bch   dodam  and some blood people shooting dinosaurs  and dinosaurs eating humans,1
36384,878번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,I watched this with my aunt who is all about girl power and the strength of women  I was visiting her once and when we went to a movie store I found this movie and I have really wanted to see it It was her first time watching Miyazaki and thought it was wonderful  Kiki goes off on her own to live as a young witch and work to help the new community she lives in  Even though it was hard she works hard and tries to do the right thing to benefit everyone  This is probably the best Miyazaki for girls,5
36385,878번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,everyone can what it  not scary except at the end for little ones no sexy stuff no swearing other than a few insults  great movie  no drinking drugs or smoking,4
36386,878번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,i thought it was really cool to watch especially if your in the UK and cant get your hands on this DVD   anyway if you like cartoons and a bit of flying magic you will definitely enjoy this its one of my favourite DVDs please watch it,2
36387,878번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,This is an awesome movie for all ages  It is a very entertaining movie to watch with a good story about a young witch trying to discover who she is  There is no violence or swearing there are some suspenseful moments when Kiki is on her broom stick but nothing scary that will keep kids up at night  It has many good lessons about helping others and being yourself also many good role models  It is still fun to watch for older kids so if your family has older kids and younger kids this is an awesome movie to watch,5
36388,878번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,Well I couldnt have predicted this After the unabashed feebleness of My Neighbor Totoro I cant say that I was too hyped to watch Kikis Delivery Service  But out of the clear blue sky Ive found a Miyazaki movie that I like even more than Princess Mononoke It shocked me as well  Kikis Delivery Service doesnt share Princess Mononokes grander or epic story telling  But then again it doesnt collapse around itself in the third act Mononokes main problem  The final product is so very whimsical I couldnt help but grin the entire way through,7
36389,878번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,awesome educational movie,1
36390,878번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,I was actually hesitant to watch this movie but it did not disappoint  It was very fun and beautifully done  I love how Studio Ghibli always makes it feel like youre in that time  One of my favorite scenes was when Kiki and Tombo ride the bike together very cute  Good scenery animation as usual,5
36391,878번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,People always say That if I Was Any Movie Character Id Be Kiki  This Movie Is The 4th Miyazaki Film I Have Ever Seen Out of 9 and It So Edge of Your Seat and The Animation is Breathtaking I Think Kikis Delivery Service is One of The Top 30 Best Movies Ever Made,2
36392,878번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,My family and I loved this movie Kikis so sweet and the same goes for Osono and Jiji This has to be one of my favorite studio ghibli movies,3
36393,878번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,I love this movie,1
36541,889번,Knives Out,8,Great movie love the mystery and comedy  This movie is one of my favorites but it has a little too much language that didnt need to be in the movie,2
36542,889번,Knives Out,8,Very entertaining with a great cast and plot  Its a bit slow at times but the plot twists and ending make up for it,2
36543,889번,Knives Out,8,Context when I walk into a movie theater I automatically have a negative opinion on the movie  This had gotten to the point where I wasnt sure if this was a good strategy as there was always SOMETHING that made me dislike a movie   And then    there was Knives Out,3
36544,889번,Knives Out,8,This movie is a murder mystery film it has violence and some cussing  However the characters are wellrounded and clever this is a very good murder mystery movie that is a must watch if you like comedy and thrillers,2
36545,889번,Knives Out,8,I personally love this movie  I think most kids in 6th grade and up should see it  The cast is phenomenal  Its not surprising but the story line is,4
36546,889번,Knives Out,8,I LOVED the movie my parents and I saw a ad and we just had to watch it I wasnt very surprised when they said who it was  Your welcome for not spoiling but I think everyone knew who ACTUALLY killed him kind of obvious,1
36547,889번,Knives Out,8,Plot Google it yourself ,1
36548,889번,Knives Out,8,cool movie an excellent mystery followed by excellent acting Daniel Craig and Chris Evans A fascinating funny mystery Its cool and epic and for sure a must watch,1
36549,889번,Knives Out,8,This movie is great fun and great everyone over 11,1
36550,889번,Knives Out,8,This movie is sooo goood Its so funny but you always are wondering what happened and how did the detective know But parents need to know that there is an affair medicationdrugs a tiny bit of violence and scariness smoking drinking a tiny bit of bloodetc  this movie is good but for kids who can handle that and kids who can handle that only For ages 14 shouldnt have to be mature,5
36657,893번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,I loved this movie  One of the best of the year  The animation of course is gorgeous and flawless the voice acting is great the action sequences were exciting and surprisingly brutal the score is beautiful and the storytelling is amazing with the main character telling stories with origami  The 3D is unnecessary  Grade A,5
36658,893번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,Impeccable and majestic beauty Laika is already a strengthened production studio of distinguished films that combine traditional animation with a reserved use of digital technology obtaining an air more craft and realistic technique present in feature films such as the gloomy Coraline or the terrifying ParaNorman Laika has established a great fortitude and prestige in a world in where Pixar prevails year after year Kubo and The Two Strings consolidates the essence of prior all films of the studio while adding something extra courtesy of a timeless visual and narrative magnificence an eloquent feat of 2016 and openly a direct nominated to The Academy Awards,1
36659,893번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,Kubo is one of the best films I have seen in a long time and I have no doubt it will be nominated for an Oscar much less win  The visuals are absolutely stunning a mix of stopmotion and animation that creates a visual masterpiece  The story and plot are complex and is told in quite a beautiful way  That being said it is a very dark tale right from the beginning with many deaths one very unexpected and sad one many many scenes of peril and VERY intense violence with blood and injuries  Many scenes have very creepy ambiance and tone  The language is pretty tame although there is one use of the word hell in reference to how humans live compared to how another character does  I would say this is for about kids 10 who can handle it  My sensitive 10 yearold brother had nightmares but there were other other younger children who did just fine  However dont let that shy you away from this stunning film as it is also pretty funny and sweet and has a great message about family and love  For more mature audience this is an absolute mustsee,10
36660,893번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,This is now my favourite movie,1
36661,893번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,This was a great fantastical movie  Its about a young boy named Kubo who has a mysterious power to make paper shape into little creatures when he plays his shamisen guitarlike instrument ,2
36662,893번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,In a year of talking animated animal movies Kubo may be far one of the best next to Zootopia  While Kubo isnt exactly a talking animal film Other than a beetle and a monkey this strange stop motion piece of art is really neat and beautifully done,2
36663,893번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,It is great and I loved it  Something Ive never seen before but doesnt stray too far away from normal  Good lure and original story,3
36664,893번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,I have to say that the visual affects on this movie is spectacular and good  But on the down side this movie could have been better and not so forced pushed in the end their were some parts that were spiritual in a way also  and also there is a lot of violence for a PG movie  ,4
36665,893번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,It was cute but the childish characters and the boring slow pace ruined it for me  Also it does get a bit too disturbing but not too depressing,2
36666,893번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,Scary,1
36667,894번,"Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter",8,This is not some nice snowy film with an adventure  Its some depressing story you dont want to watch and doesnt make you feel inspired either,2
36668,894번,"Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter",8,So if you are hoping for an uplifting snowy adventure NO this is NOT what you are looking for at all  It is so depressing it is too long uneventful  So half of the movie she has done nothing except be in her town she is a mentally ill lady who goes into the wilderness to find treasure from Fargo the movie lets down kindness twice throws her rabbit on a train spitting into her boss tea stole his credit card A TERRIBLE MOVIE  and then,3
36669,894번,"Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter",8,My ratingPG for mature scenes,1
36697,896번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,Before I say what Im about to say this movie is awesome  The music is great humor is great character development its just great There isnt any concerning violence and other content stays within the PG range  Now that Ive said all of that Im going to say what caused me problems when I first watched this  Part of the plot has to do with Pos past and what happened to his mother and all of that made me cry  But not during the movie but several weeks after  I would literally cry myself to sleep with my mom at my bedside to try to sooth me  In other words be aware of your childs sensitivity when considering this movie  Im okay now and I think the movie is great,9
36698,896번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,This movie has a little bit more violence and the message is mildly worse  but the movie is my favorite of the 3,2
36699,896번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,Awesome  I think kids aged 6 and up will love this movie,3
36700,896번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,I saw this in theaters years agoand I wil sayits awesome  Just like the 1st movieit has a good messageand has great humor  Really worth watching overall,3
36701,896번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,Out of all the Kung Fu Panda movies this one is without a doubt my favorite and it has always been that way,1
36702,896번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,I loved Kung fu panda   so why not watch the second one it was a really good sequel   it is a little  Violence    but who cares it was AMAZING it gets you into the Kung fun spirt   so grab a pillow watch the series,1
36703,896번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,This movie has a deep message that all people should remember no matter what your past is you can choose who you are now  The animation is done very well  Very funny and a beautifully written script  It is centered around Po the panda trying to discover his past so he can find peace  It is inspiring when he finds peace even when he knows Shen was responsible for the killing of his parents  Its a must watch for families  However if your child is adopted you should consider sitting with them while the movie plays because it shows Pos parents abandoning him and this may negatively affect your adopted child,7
36704,896번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,A bird uses lots of gunpower,1
37209,915번,Leap!,6,This movie had such a rich and powerful message it brought me to tears by the ending credits  It was by far the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life  The music really contributed to the overall feel of the movie  I definitely recommend this movie,4
37210,915번,Leap!,6,So Im 13 and I personally loved this movie  My 7yr old sister came in my room and turned on this movie  I was doing homework but ended up sitting down and watching it with her  I actually think I enjoyed it more that my sister  There is a bar scene but there is no blatant drunkenness the main plot of the scene is to show  Felici dancing  The movie emphasizes hard work and the importance of forgiving others  I give this a 10 out of 10 a must see,7
37211,915번,Leap!,6,I saw this movie with a bunch of other teenage girls  We predicted every plot twist and laughed at the cheesy dialogue but thats what made it good  It is definitely unrealistic and silly from many aspects but you have to accept that and enjoy it for what it is  One of the last scenes was a bit scary for little kids  Camilles mother is chasing Felicie with a giant hammer  It would be scary for a young child but other than that it is a pretty safe movie  The messages are good  The protagonist makes mistakes must own up to them and over comes them  Overall this was a good movie,9
37212,915번,Leap!,6,Makes me want to jump off the roof  Great familyfriendly adventure for 6 years olds  Some scary parts though  LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPP Role models are GREAT,5
37213,915번,Leap!,6,Great movie for everyone,1
37214,915번,Leap!,6,I watched this movie in the theatre and I loved it It is a lovely film that mostly follows Felicie on her journey to become a Ballerina  Although the movie glosses over some of the time it took for her to become a ballerina we dont actually know how long it skipped as she practiced all we got was a rehearsal and practice montage and I thought it worked really well I would be able to watch it so many more times and not get tired of it  Also with the homocidal mom my mom told me that in Japan it is so competitive to get your kids into a good preschool that some moms have actually killed other kids  So in a way the movie mom kind of makes sense because she believes Camilles future is ruined  Great Movie,7
37215,915번,Leap!,6,I first saw this movie on a plane It was called Ballerina  I liked it so much I saw it 3 more times It inspired me to join Ballet classes and Im really enjoying them  The movie  has great messages and role models  It has very little violence and nothing inappropriate for kids It is definitely a very good family movie,7
37216,915번,Leap!,6,I would say that its good for anyone   But the boy is more of a backup character   And if there are people who mostly want movies about boy inventors then I wouldnt suggest this,3
37217,915번,Leap!,6,Good for boys and girls  I liked it,1
37354,919번,Lemonade Mouth,8,This movie is all about how a band comes together and becomes famous all from getting into detention dont go to detention kids even though you could end up being famous like these guys but that is highly unlikely sorry to burst your bubble anyway the songs are so good and its a BOP  There is nothing bad but it does include language they speak english but I bet theres versions in different languages tooo,2
37355,919번,Lemonade Mouth,8,Probably the best Disney Channel movie ever,1
37356,919번,Lemonade Mouth,8,it has everything singing  craziness silliness and makes you happy,1
37357,919번,Lemonade Mouth,8,I would say this movie wasnt amazing but its better than any other Disney Channel movie  A lot of the other movies often star a cheerful but annoying tween who has practically no social skills plus almost any main guy character in those movies is almost purely a love interest,2
37358,919번,Lemonade Mouth,8,I absolutely ADORE this movie and I am almost 15 years old  Its AMAZING and filled with great messages great music and great role models  There is a little bit of romance although I wouldnt exactly call it that  I have no other word  One of the main characters has a boyfriend and she kisses his cheek but there is no lip on lip kissing  She later finds her boyfriend with another girl whos wearing his jacket and touching his bicep  Another main character tells a girl that he likes her but its no big deal,7
37359,919번,Lemonade Mouth,8,What can I say This movie when I watched it seemed perfect  Despite being GPG rated different sources say different ratings they didnt hold back from adding emotional and tougher scenes which now that Im older I enjoy more and more  As much as I loved it now I dont know if I would have loved it as much if I were younger  I recommend it for kids eleven and up although its great for a movie night with the entire family ,5
37360,919번,Lemonade Mouth,8,This movie in my opinion is really cheesy and is not worth watching  I mean in one scene out of the clear blue sky everyone starts playing  a song when they just meet as if they have been practicing for YEARS  And in another before theyre first performance a main character Olivia is feeling nervous and then as if it will make the world perfect one of her band mates passes her some lemonade and then POOF Everyone can move on with their wonderful lives  Some of the music was kind of good but in my opinion not good enough to make up for the unrealistic story line,5
37361,919번,Lemonade Mouth,8,Really good,1
37362,919번,Lemonade Mouth,8,It is a really good movie with lots of cool songs  I havent seen it in a few years but I still remember Determinate  Also it has a lot of good messages such as defend your friends from bullies and stand up for what you believe in,3
37814,930번,Lightyear,7,This Is a very nice movie  Love the teamwork and the action  It is a little funny but it is a family movie,3
37815,930번,Lightyear,7,This is a fun space movie  I have a couple qualms about it however  The movies intro notes that the movie in from 1995 but ironically its the best animated Pixar film to date in my mind  Secondarily and this is not the movies fault people have been interpreting the scene where there is a samesex kiss as a heavily sexualized scene but this is not true  The characters kiss for 0 2 seconds and its edited out in the Disney version  Additionally people seem to not care whether or not straight couples kiss in movies so I dont see the big deal  The movie has a great cast of voices featuring Chris Evans as Buzz doing an OK job replacing Tim Allen James Brolin as a redesign of Zurg Buzzs enemy from Toy Story 2 Keke Palmer as Izzy Hawthorne the grandchild of Buzzs friend Alisha and Taika Watiti as Mo Morisson a hapless space recruit  In terms of violence the movie is okay in the opening scenes there are vine aliens which spray green blood when attacked with a lightsaberesque weapon  Zurgs robots are semiviolent  There are carnivore bugs which attempt to eat Buzz in one scene  Several aliens are electrified on a laser shield but this is not really violent and mainly used for comedic relief  Zurg has a dangerous mech suit which shoots lasers at Buzz and grabs him with a large grappling hook  Zurg also has an evil version of Buzzs robot Sox which appears to be melty and is kind of gross  Zurgs backstory is kind of sad as he SPOILERS is an old version of Buzz who was abused by the various military commanders and went on too many time travel missions causing his friends to pass away and give him the idea he forced them away  A character is often captured by the previously mentioned sentient vines but is shown to escape another is presumably killed by the vines  There are some strange scenes involving scientific depictions of time travel which may confuse younger kids  Explosions are shown but often in a stereotypical manner  Buzz is slightly abused by a military commander who seeks to exploit his skills  Buzz steals a ship from a space headquarters to save the planet but this may be interpreted as flatout criminal activity by your children  Its a pretty okay movie for kids 8 and up and it comes with a cute robot cat so who couldnt resist,20
37816,930번,Lightyear,7,They worked too hard on the animation and not hard enough on the story  For most of the movie he just tries and fails to get back to his home planet  And then he gives up in the end  The End  Blah  The animation is pretty good though But other than that blah,7
37817,930번,Lightyear,7,The whole movie had an objective and they didnt even achieve that objective  Started out strong but got weaker and weaker,2
37818,930번,Lightyear,7,This is an amazing movie  I found it funny and actionpacked  Sox carried the whole movie  The only reason people said it was inappropriate is because there was a 0 2 second same sex kiss That was cut on Disney,4
37819,930번,Lightyear,7,I is so good buzz lightyear has a amazing adventure throw space it is a family film and you can learn a lot about space from this film which is why I rated this film 5 stars,1
37820,930번,Lightyear,7,Dont know what the fuss is all about  Great film my 8yearold was a bit confused with the plot thats why I put 9 and older,2
37856,934번,Lilo and Stitch,8,If you enjoy 00s Disney films this is a great pick for you  Has many nostalgic elements from many childhoods  I recommend this for ages 6 and up because some scenes can be frightening for younger viewers  Great film,4
37857,934번,Lilo and Stitch,8,So Im a teen mom with a 2 year old running around my house I watched this movie when I was a kid and I personally think its a good movie for kids around 5 maybe even younger with their parents around  It is important that they know its not ok to talk to strangers and its not ok to fight but this movie is something for the kids and parents to sit and watch WITH THEM  My little girl can learn values from the movie like family strength,3
37858,934번,Lilo and Stitch,8,I changed my mind  I really love Lilo  Stitch because theyre so cool But theyre sister Hona is rude and bossy  But shes okay  The Music is Amazing The Opening was Fantastic The Animation is Awesome And The Characters are very funny I saw this movie when I was a little kid  And I liked it  I laughed at the funny parts of this hilarious and action packed movie This movie is very funny for kids 5 and up,9
37859,934번,Lilo and Stitch,8,I have this movie on DVD and think its really touching it teaches kids that sometimes in life things might not always go the way you planned them  it also teaches to respect people for who they are even if there an alien  I also love the connection between stitch and lilo in this movie  the bit were stitch leaves because he feels like he doesnt feel right in lilos world made me cry  really good movie,5
37860,934번,Lilo and Stitch,8,Some rude words like stupidhead and butt but I think its good for 6 and up  Some violence but I thought it was great 4 and a half stars,3
37861,934번,Lilo and Stitch,8,Most of the reviews here seem to swing dramatically one way or the other  Taken for what it is its a great movie  Its funny sweet a bit of a tearjerker and I just love the round comfortablelooking character design Pretty much every character is likable too even the antagonistic ones are trying to do the right thing,4
37862,934번,Lilo and Stitch,8,i love ohana means family and family means no one gets left behind or forgotten and its such a cute movie,1
37863,934번,Lilo and Stitch,8,Its good for kids like me yes,1
37864,934번,Lilo and Stitch,8,This movie has cute characters many positive role models and laughs,1
37865,934번,Lilo and Stitch,8,I think it is a good  comedy for kids 6  Sometimes they yell    There  also a war scene  with shooting cannons and guns  You  should watch this film right now,5
38278,958번,Lost and Found,4,Im not exaggerating this movie is GORGEOUS  But it might scare or depress little kids  Ex  the graphic and very realistic storm at sea giant octopus rises from the water and turns out to be a freind My sister was scared of the octopus  And tears exploded from her eyes in an emotonal storm when the boy was looking for the penguin  GREAT movie would watch any time  3 stars left out two for the sadness scariness,8
38279,958번,Lost and Found,4,Nothing is scary in this movie  There were really adorable characters that treat each other sweetly  I love that penguin The octopus looked scary for 1 minute but they were sleeping on the bottom of the boat and the octopus helped them because he was great,4
38292,963번,Love & Mercy,8,If your ideal movie is a terrible story that has no plot action or conflict I would recommend this one to you for sure  There is nothing bad in the movie a toddler could watch it  The movie is just not good  Its boring as hell,4
38293,963번,Love & Mercy,8,I love the Beach Boys but not Mike Love  And this biopic kinda missed the mark for me  The 60s scenes were so enjoyable the 90s not so much  If it had been only the 60s I probably wouldve liked it more although I understand the importance of Brian Wilsons life in the 90s  So this is worth a watch  For half of it at least,6
38294,963번,Love & Mercy,8,This film is absolutely amazing and very different  This movie contains some language especially in one scene and a lot of pot use  There are also some very intense scenes when Brian is having panic attacks and hallucinating  But I highly recommend this film,4
38295,963번,Love & Mercy,8,My ratingPG13 for racy referencessome languageand drug use throughout,1
38565,973번,Luca,5,This film has some scary moments but kids will still enjoy and is a positive movie,1
38566,973번,Luca,5,I am 11 years old watched it with my father and my 6 year old brother,1
38567,973번,Luca,5,yes,1
38568,973번,Luca,5,Educational a lot of positive messages such as dont be overprotective parent looks doesnt matter  what you do does teams can do everything follow your dreams,1
38569,973번,Luca,5,It was a pretty good movie  I had low expectations so I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was better than I thought it was going to be  It has really good meaning and the music is excellent,3
38570,973번,Luca,5,I watched this with my mom and sister it was good I liked the part when Lucas uncle comes over its really funny Some of the fishing supplies Knives hooks spears and nets were a little creepy because they were all around the town  I enjoyed this movie I hope you do too,4
38571,973번,Luca,5,i actualy liked this movie  theres nothing wrong with it,2
38572,973번,Luca,5,A funny movie that gets everybody in the family belly laughing Luca is a brilliant Pixar feature  I would recommend it to any family who enjoy films like Inside Out Zootopia or really any of Pixars amazing movies  But although all the family will deeply enjoy it and want to watch it again and again only 9 will really appreciate the emotional ending,3
38573,973번,Luca,5,This is a really fun and wholehearted movie that kids will love Its about a young boy who is a sea monster ventures out into a small Italian town to make a new adventures,2
38574,973번,Luca,5,i still love it maybe a little intense with the fighting and everything but it is still great,2
38888,989번,Maleficent,8,Maleficent was truly magnificent though I wouldnt recomend it for 7 and under because the scenes are a bit dark and have a little violence  Other then that it was good  The only things that I think relate to sleeping beauty are the set up and cast but Maleficent is a movie in itself  Angelina Jollie and Elle Fanning did a great job as Maleficent and Princess Aurora  My absolute favorite character had to be Maleficent for her brilliant acting  I think it is a good family movie and if I had the chance to I would definitely go see it again,6
38889,989번,Maleficent,8,When Maleficent was fighting it was a bit too violent but there is a good message later on in the film,1
38890,989번,Maleficent,8,It was just a dark retelling of Sleeping Beauty  Nothing extraordinary but still good,2
38891,989번,Maleficent,8,Maleficent is a great movie based on the original fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty but from the villains point of view  The movie does have some violence and some scary scenes which could be disturbing for some children  However Maleficent is a very creative version of Sleeping Beauty that shows a totally different side of the story,3
38892,989번,Maleficent,8,I saw this movie with my family and it was better than I was expecting  Such a great movie with heartwarming scenes  Although some of the scenes SPOILER ALERT were a bit intense for some kids in my opinion like when Maleficent wakes up and realizes her wings have been cut off and cries out in distress and when Maleficent is trapped in a net which is hurting her  But these scenes are not too intense from my perspective  Another thing is when ANOTHER SPOILER rescues a crow he turns him into a naked man But NOTHING below the waist is shown so it is not that innaproprate  at all and nothing sexual is seen or done  This movie is pretty good and has great messages like not letting anger make you a horrible person and that some men are not as nice as they seem,6
38893,989번,Maleficent,8,Im ten and I LOVED this movie it is beautiful and surprising not like any other movie Ive ever seen   Very intense and includes a VERY powerful message   I would recommend 910 year olds for good reasons Maleficents anger is overpowers her and can scare younger kids as can the battle scenes but the battle scenes are not as scary as some of the reviews have said  This movie is not quite as scary as some of the reviews have said including the one that says there are decapitated people and a bloody stump which by the way you have to look SUPER close to see any of that,5
38894,989번,Maleficent,8,Okay the violence is the only thing thats not for younger kids  This movie was very good and the graphics special CGI effects were just awesome  Okay for 10,3
38895,989번,Maleficent,8,I saw this delightful movie with some friends for a birthday party and we were overwhelmed by how extraordinary this film was  It was about love but not romantic  It was funny at times but a little scary for younger kids  It was a bit violent at times but we went with my friends 7 year old sister and she loved it I was worried when she began crying but she said it was because she was happy that Maleficent didnt die  In the scary scenes she wanted to hide her eyes behind my purse but it was ok  over all it was completely amazing  Maleficent was the best movie Ive seen in years I love this film so much that I am going to watch it again,8
38896,989번,Maleficent,8,The movie has a good message is funny somewhat saddening exciting and beautiful at the same time  Angelina Jolie was amazing at her part  Great twist on a classic tale,3
38897,989번,Maleficent,8,Great movie The only bad part about it is when Maleficent gets her wings cut offno blood though just sad  The movie is worth going too  My eleven year old sister and I really enjoyed it,4
39084,995번,Manny,8,My rating PG13 intense sequences of violence and language,1
39593,679번,Coco,6,The best,1
39594,679번,Coco,6,This movie was really good  Its probably one of my favorite marvel movies  I recommend this movie,3
39595,679번,Coco,6,So good it made me cry,1
39596,679번,Coco,6,I remember watching this back in late 2017 to early 2018,1
39597,679번,Coco,6,If you still have encanto fever try watching this  it might be fine for a mature 6 year old but i recommend 7 pretty much the reason why is because younger kids 4 to 6 years old may be scared of some things like the images and death it also has murder from posion and murder from pushing off heights nongraphic no blood and no injurys shown for both the boy who was pushed also was saved before he hit the ground in it skeletons ect  mild crude humor that kids may not get but it has pretty good representation as it has tons of mexican culture,3
39598,679번,Coco,6,I dont mind this movie but I did find it quite boring  The storyline was great though  I dont understand why people find this scary but it really isnt and I feel they are just being dramatic,3
39599,679번,Coco,6,Beautiful  Great representation of Mexican culture and so much time and effort put into the art  I love it and am having so much trouble why some people think its scary because of skeletons,3
39824,701번,Cool Runnings,7,Delightful tweenfriendly story of Jamaican bobsledders,1
39825,701번,Cool Runnings,7,I liked the movie because the bobsled races where cool and if I was there I think it would be fun  I like the lesson in the movie like if you believe in your self you can achieve your goals and dont cheat and to respaced each other and other people  and i liked the way the Jamaicans talked it was funny,3
39826,701번,Cool Runnings,7,I watched this movie with my family and while there are really positive messages like work hard for what you believe in and teamwork there also unfortunately  A LOT of swearing and a sexual reference where on of the characters says Ive known you since she asked to see your dingaling  which made me feel very uncomfortable as a 14 year old girl  I would recommend it but definetly talk with your kids about the pros and cons,3
39827,701번,Cool Runnings,7,I really enjoyed it it was so funny  So many funny jokes and comments that made me laugh  I really enjoyed the end it was very inspiring,3
39828,701번,Cool Runnings,7,Good family movie,1
39829,701번,Cool Runnings,7,Cool Runnings is an awesome movie Everyone should watch it  It has a bit of swearing but not bad  Great lesson about teamwork and never giving up  Good movie to watch on a movie night and as a family  Overall excellent movie and a must watch,6
39830,701번,Cool Runnings,7,This is a great movie  I really like it because  It is funny and  shows you can do anything if you put your mind to it       ,3
39831,701번,Cool Runnings,7,Some swearing and a little fighting but great lesson about  Jamaica and based off of a true story,1
39832,701번,Cool Runnings,7,I think this movie has a lot of swearingbut i a also learned all about Jamaica,1
40219,704번,Coraline,8,My sister had first showed me this film when I was 7 I was terrified and it caused my phobia of buttons to increase and get worse by a lot  It is a creepy film and I personally dont recommend anyone under 10 to watch it  It has a dark storyline and I didnt enjoy it  I appreciate that not everyone has a phobia of buttons but I still believe anyone under 10 should definitely beware,4
40220,704번,Coraline,8,My brother saw this alone at night when he was 6 and it terrified him  I saw it when I was 7 and  I thought it was scary but not too much  Me and my brother each love the movie  The stop animation effect is great and its always exciting We watch it together all the time now and we still love it  I think that you can see it when you are 7 but it will still be pretty scary,6
40221,704번,Coraline,8,Good for ages  and up but has some moments were might scae young children,1
40222,704번,Coraline,8,Coraline is kind of like a horror film for younger children  I was around 7 when I first watched Coraline and I was kind of scared at the time however watchiing a horror film made me feel cool and grownup which is one of the reasons I think that kids enjoy it  Theres many scary scenes in the film but nothing that is extremely disturbing  A woman in the film tries to persuade a young girl to sew button into her eyes which is incredibly creepy  The part that scared me the most and still does now sometimes is the end when a girl is being chased  by this spider like human Im not trying to go into detail because of spoilers   A part that may make parents feel slightly uncomfortable is a scene where  two old women are almost naked its for comedy not anything sexual while they are on a trapeze  f youre children are sensitive and are not used to violence and disturbing content then this is not the best thing to show them,7
40223,704번,Coraline,8,I think this movie is fine for 10 year olds and up  I watched it at the age I am now 9 in 2017 and it gave me a good scare but I think 1982s Poltergeist is way creepier than this  This film does have a killer mom than wants to sew buttons into Coralines eyes but if youve watched the Goosebumps movie The Haunting Hour TV show and Beetlejuice then youre definitely fine with this  By the way I slept in my bedroom on my own with only two lights on and I didnt have any nightmares,4
40224,704번,Coraline,8,Well its all about a monster who lures children away from their parents and tricks them into having buttons sewn into their eyes so it definitely deserves a pg13 rating but other than that its a really good movie about how you really never appreciate something enough until its gone  it is dark and disturbing and the animation somehow makes it a lot scarier,2
40225,704번,Coraline,8,Okay Im kind of a freak and have always been kind of abnormal but I freaking loved this movie when I was 5  Yeah its creepy but thats what makes it fun and it certainly will challenge a kid more than squeakyclean trash we shove down the throats of our fellow young uns  Though if your kid is a little wussI mean is more sensitive take some precautions and watch some clips first  And about the naked woman pasties partGrow up  No kid thinks its a big deal its a joke and its a suit  Not to mention the naked body is everywhere at home in art etc so is it that big of a problem,6
40226,704번,Coraline,8,Good film well animated  But scary for younger audiences  Not for sensitive children parents should watch first to be certain,3
40227,704번,Coraline,8,In this movie the parents do not help or care about the child  This might make a child think that it is common and feel scared that this might happen to them   I watched this at school sadly  My teacher gave this movie to watch and my mom would have never approved such movie  I do not see that there are important lessons or even a role model that a child like me should look up to  Another disturbing part was the button eyes  I think it is very frightening for a child to see instead of eyes buttons  My friend had nightmares after watched the movie,8
40228,704번,Coraline,8,To be honest I dont know why this movie was a PG  Even I found this scary and i hardly find ANYTHING scary  It is such a horrible idea  People with button eyes Thats bad enough  Your parents with button eyes  WOW,7
40256,704번,Coraline,7,It was very creepy and the actors were not very good  Some parts were funny like those two crazy lady but others were creepy or boring,2
40257,704번,Coraline,7,Coraline is a great movie  Although it may look like a kid friendly movie Im warning you its not what it seems  The movie is not only scary but actually very creepy  Showing people with button eyes can scare young kids  Some scenes are dark and creepy and will scare children  I recommend this movie for kids between ages 9 and 15  Great movie though very enjoyable,7
40258,704번,Coraline,7,The first time I watched this movie was when I was five  This is my most favorite movie ever I am very into creepy dark and horrorish movies tv series and books its just what I like  This movie is fun and interesting and creepy  It also has some great messages and role models  The main character shows us that you should be curious to a limit but you should still explore  The other main character shoes us to never give up and that you should always stick by your friends  This is an amazing movie in my opinion but if you are really sensitive and young then it would be probably better for them not to watch it  I hope you found my review helpfull  By the way I am 12 years old,10
40259,704번,Coraline,7,Coraline was a movie i was thoroughly dissapointed with  It was horrible and i would never tell anyone to watch it AND if they said they were going too i would tell them not too simply cause of the crappy stop motion lackluster plot and ridiculous trops that it presents definitally not worth the time,2
40260,704번,Coraline,7,This movie is definetely one of my favorites  The reviews saying that this should be for ages 13 14 and especially 17 are RIDICULOUS  I watched this movie when I was about 8 or 9 and have loved it ever sense  Maybe thats because I grew up watching horror movies and am a big strange myself  It didnt creep me out at all  If your child is anxious or very emotional maybe hold off until theyre 11  But if not really any age over 7 is good   I also think coraline is quite a role model  For a 12 year old she is very independent creative and ambitious  yes she has attitude towards her parents  but that is pretty normal,11
40261,704번,Coraline,7,5 Year olds dont understand the TRUE story to whats going on  I first watched this when I was 6 and all I could figure out was that there was an evil lady who was trying to take coraline  Now Im older Ive realized there is much more to it then that but the clues are subtle  Its a very good movie great for little kids who are into creepy things but you dont want to show them saw or something  There is no swearing in this film unless you count the cra P word to be one but its highly un noticable,5
40262,704번,Coraline,7,This movie has a great message to be happy with what you have but otherwise throw this movie inside your garbage bag  I watched this and I stayed up late cause I couldnt get to sleep  In this movie the Other Mother takes Coralines parents at the end shows gross bugs and is just plain scary and weird  The Other Mother later turns into a hideous monster who wants to put doll eyes on Coraline  Only reason I gave it 2 stars is cause of the great stop motion animation,5
40263,704번,Coraline,7,Im 14  I saw this movie when I was 7  I loved it I watched it many times and learned a lot from it  Although I was creeped out I have always been a fan of horror even when I was little and it didnt keep me up at night  If your kid is into ghosts or zombies and you think that they can handle some mature themes like dead kids absent parents etc  its a great movie  Its messed up but great  My brother on the other hand who was 9 when he saw it couldnt sleep  Hes never been a horror person and although it didnt freak him out for more than a few days he shouldve waited to see it  Evaluate whether or not your kid is a fit for the movie its worth watching if they are and you as an adult should watch it too One of my favorite animated movies,12
40264,704번,Coraline,7,I saw this movie when I was about 6 and I was so scared and I ran out of the theater and was crying because I was so scared and then my mom made me go back in and Im glad she did because it was funny and scary,1
40265,704번,Coraline,7,This movie is very creepy if you read the book,1
40335,704번,Coraline,8,its a great movie with lots of cool effects the lady with the big boobies mrs forcible WAS JUST WEARING A ZIPPER COSTUME you know like a barney costume,1
40336,704번,Coraline,8,i loved this movie I saw it when I was nine and I read the book and memorized every line from the movie my parents thought I was insane but oh well  I think this movie gave me a positive message saying things arent always as good as they may seem or be careful what you wish for  I dont think its really for kids though because some scenes are a bit scary and could possibly scar young children,3
40337,704번,Coraline,8,I love this movie It captures your attention from the beginning all the way until the end  The moral of this movie is explained by the movies slogan be careful what you wish for  Coraline discovers that the grass is not always greener on the other side  In this movie Coraline feels unloved and neglected by her parents neighbors and friend Wybie  She soon finds a little door that is bricked up  However later that night a mouse leads her to that door and a strange portal or tunnel opens up that leads to a replica of the house only everything is better  It seems as though everything is a dream come true until the other mother trys to keep her there forever  Coraline quickly discorvs the truth about the world she thought was paridice and quickly tries to escape from the spiders web,9
40338,704번,Coraline,8,Its supermelonkitty204 with your top reviews  Though Coraline might seem like a calm movie the whole film has a very creepy vibe  The story is about a young girl moving to an old apartment building in a quiet and mysterious little town  Coraline the main character travels to another dimension through a secret door in her home every night  The land is filled with succulent treats and whimsical characters  She is involved in somewhat strange activities  After several visits her other parents the ones from the other world want to sow buttons in her eyes but she refuses  When she rebels the so called wondrous land turns into a dark ruin full of hatred  Her parents are trapped and she must escape while freeing them  This strange creepy and might I say derranged movie is a stop for kids 9 and younger,10
40339,704번,Coraline,8,Which is better A movie about a girl with magical powers  bloody violence included  OR a movie about creepy people that want to sew buttons into the girls EYES then KILL her RATED R CARRIE SEEMS BETTER,2
40340,704번,Coraline,8,Be warned went I saw this when I was 8 I was freaked out of my freakin mind  It creeps me out to this day,2
40341,704번,Coraline,8,Agegroups 14,1
40342,704번,Coraline,8,I watched this when I was around nine and I freaked out  I turned it off halfway through when Coralines real parents were gone  It was disturbing and scary to me but I get freaked out easily  I wouldnt recommend it for kids below 7 though and its iffy for 89  If shehe is frightened easily then I wouldnt suggest this,5
40343,704번,Coraline,8,I myself think is an AMAZING movie  but I think it is not made for all children like for ezanple my sister  when she saw the movie she was so frittened that she cried like 5 times during the movie she even had to stay out of the theather but of course she is scared of certain things  but my brother is littler than my sister and he loved it  this is a movie I would say is for kids who are brave and enjoys a llitle scare or two  its a movie thats exiting triling mystirius and obove all scary fun  but ofcourse I am just a fan so my thoughts may be different than yours  I hope this was a help,9
40344,704번,Coraline,8,its just a little scary because of the fake mother and the trapping but overall it was really good,1
40520,704번,Coraline,4,Not for little kids,1
40521,704번,Coraline,4,I think it is a good movie but some parts are creepy  There is some parts that are disturbing like this lady who sings on stage and she is wearing almost nothing,2
40522,704번,Coraline,4,This and Up are the best animated movies I think Ive ever seen  Its absolutely incredious stopmotion animation is fantastic and the plot is formulaic and predictable but you get caught up in it  WATCH THIS MOVIE Just look out for a scene where an old woman whos extremely chesty that I think shouldve given Coraline at least a PG13 rating,4
40523,704번,Coraline,4,I love the movie and the book  Its very good for kids my age,2
40524,704번,Coraline,4,A Good Movie For Older Kids Because I Might Scare Younger Kids  But It Has A Good Message to be careful what you wish for,2
40525,704번,Coraline,4,Its a weird movie but it can grow on you  The only violent part about it is how Coraline rips out her othermothers button eyes  I know  Weird  The inappropriate scene is when Coraline goes to the elderly womens preformance  One of the women is only wearing stars over her breasts and a small pair of underwear  There arent any good rolemodels in this film because theyre all crazy and rude,7
40526,704번,Coraline,4,It was so Awesome I went to see it with my little sister and her friend and I wasnt dissapointed  I later learned almost all my friends loved it  I wanna go read the book now,3
40527,704번,Coraline,4,This movie was made by the animation maestro Henry Selick who also directed the masterpiece The Nightmare Before Christmas Tim Burton only PRODUCED people  That fact and its source material a novella by Neil Gaiman one of the darkest and best authors currently living means that this may  not be suitable for young young children,2
40528,704번,Coraline,4,We think only adults in a weird mood will enjoy it We guess its okay for 13 and up but it should not be watched by little dudes  There is one very inappropriate scene when Coraline goes to the theater and even if it is just a costume it is so wrong This should be rated PG13 Keep your kids away from creepy Coraline,4
40529,704번,Coraline,4,I love this movie    its great   and I mean its great Im 15 and notice that it is still great  Im not really 4   but listen This movie is so great so I got it for free at httpwww rewards1 comindex phpreferrerid52805,4
40787,719번,Crenshaw,8,Its really good and also long I think this book was really good and it was also my first ever book I recommend it and its also very interesting,2
40788,719번,Crenshaw,8,Love this,1
40789,719번,Crenshaw,8,I really liked the book Crenshaw because it makes the reader think a lot about the struggles of homelessness,1
40790,719번,Crenshaw,8,read it,1
40791,719번,Crenshaw,8,This book is really cute and sweet  Jackson is really funny and there is nothing bad in this book Crenshaw is my favorite character and Robin is also funny too,3
40792,719번,Crenshaw,8,I thought that Crenshaw was an interesting book  It had a lot of flashbacks which made it confusing to some  It also had a lot of things that are about being homeless and SPOILER ALERT About stealing that might make some people a little un  comfortable  All in all though I thought it was a great book with great life  lessons interesting characters and great role  models  P S There were some cool facts snuck into the books,6
40793,719번,Crenshaw,8,A book about a family with a kid who believes in facts until he gets the imaginary friend he needs,1
40794,719번,Crenshaw,8,This book is super uplifting and talks about a kid named Jackson whos is going thourgh rough times with losing their house and Imaginary friends,1
40795,719번,Crenshaw,8,What do you think it would be like to have no money and no food That is how Jacksons family is   Crenshaw is his imaginary ginormous cat friend who helps him through the building blocks of life  Read this book and I assure you it will melt your heart,4
41598,823번,Doctor Strange,8,My persomal MPAA rating,1
41599,823번,Doctor Strange,8,This movie is really good and though there is a small amount of blood it is mostly magical fighting  The main character gets in a car crash because of texting and loses use of his hands  The battle scenes are pretty intense though  I definitely recommend this movie  It is my 2nd favorite ever my first being AntMan,5
41600,823번,Doctor Strange,8,I just want to start of with the visuals  They are soooo good and you would thing it was real  For violence there are some medical operations minimal blood except in one scene  Fights with energy type weapons and weird swords  The ancient one dies from a stab and falls out of a portal onto the streets glass shattered  When the ancient one dies there are blood scrapes and scratches on her face you cand hear the monitor beep  Doctor strange is shown dying over and over again Impaled by crystal rocks smashed with giant hand energy beam all without blood though  If you see it you can see someone on the ground with a blood pool around there head they presumably live  Language such as shit damn hell ass and god oh my god or just god as a exclamation  Doctor strange and a fellow surgeon share a kiss  All in all a great addition to the MCU but not my favorite,11
41601,823번,Doctor Strange,8,If you decide violence is no object for your kids you should be 100 fine with them seeing it  No sexual content language is a little strong but notsorecurring,2
41602,823번,Doctor Strange,8,violence 710,1
41603,823번,Doctor Strange,8,I think this movie is good for ages nine and up but for kids who like action movies Id say eight and up its a really good movie I watch it again,1
41604,823번,Doctor Strange,8,I have seen other reviews that say doctor strange is bloody and gruesome but that is only when they show stuff in the hospital that strange works at  This movie is great but you shouldnt let kids under seven watch it  It a had a bit of violence but not to much  There is a car crash at about the 15 minute mark and it is quite intense  There is a time loop at the end where strange gets killed like ten times but it is not disturbing They only show how hes going to get killed but never actually show him getting killed  Theres also a lot of destruction but thats all,6
42071,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Dora the explorer is basiclly about a girl and a monkey and together they go on adventures  I loved the show when i was 36  and i think prechooler would enjoy the show  She learn kids some basic spanish like hola and bien   Parents might get irritated of the opening since the lyrics is the name  dodododora yelled randomly to the music  I dont get why everyone hates when she say things like what was your favourite part and replays It was mine too or something like that but what is she supposed to say  I hate hat part or something similar Like csm said there is a bunch of dora toys clothing  games etc  The show gets too much hate its a show for kids after all,8
42072,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Although Dora is likable to some people I am well on the contrary to that  Swiper is too scary to sensitive viewers and is a bad example to kids  He teaches them how to steal stuff from other Her shirt is too small and exposes her belly button People between the ages of 2 and 5 are too young to learn Spanish  They barely know how to talk yet  The worst part is that this show may teach Mexican children and parents how to sneak into the United States illegally due to her overinspiring nature about adventure culture and her willingness to travel the world and having too much perseverance to inspire people to become fugitives  Plus it is too dangerous to go miles away from their home alone with a monkey named Boots  They could get killed by a serial killer get lost even with map and go to dangerous places they have no idea about  Overall this show is no good at all to people,10
42073,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Dora goes to completely unrealistic places and the antagonist Swiper the Fox is a complete fool,1
42074,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,this show is anoying,1
42075,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,cuz she screams and stuff  And is violent n stuff  do nit watch,3
42076,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,OkayI used to LOVE thishad a lot of DVDS but the main problem is that the plot is always the same,1
42077,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Dora has a rabid monkey she runs into the forest with it  She doesnt tell her parents when she leaves  All in all Dora is a bad example for children,3
42078,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,All they have to do to stop Swiper is say Swiper no swiping and then he says Awwwwww meaaaaaan and he goes away  Thats absolutely stupid If Swiper is the villain why does he listen to Dora and Boots,5
42079,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,It barleys teaches spanishit steaches bad stuff like talking to strangers and playing wity animals that could he dangerous or have diseaseits anoying to dont bother,1
42080,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,It is educational for little kids,1
42081,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,i cant believe that people would let their kids watch this  HER BELLY IS SHOWING PEOPLE,3
42082,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,I Hate This Show Its Retarded  Annoying   Horrible And Bad  Children Should Never Watch This Show They Should Watch Proper Kids Shows Like Bob The Builder Or Thomas The Tank Engine And Friends Or Fireman Sam Or Pingu,1
42083,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Dora the Explorer is a really amazing show  It sends great messages for kids ages 2 to 10  Its also funny and it can teach kids to talk a little Spanish and be super nice to other people  Thats why Dora the Explorer is a really amazing show for kids to watch  There is nothing negitive about the show at all,5
42084,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,I think Dora is a great remodel for children  I would totally recommend Dora,3
42085,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Not only does it teach kids Spanish the wrong way seems to suck at pronunciation but their method is to say something in Spanish without saying what it means  It turns this otherwise unremarkable Nicktoon into barely comprehensible crap that has plenty of errors and has annoying characters bad writing obnoxious songs and mediocre animation,2
42086,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Goatworlds here  Mediocre animation bad plot no action crappy adventures pathetic voiceacting and unlikable characters  Swiper the braindead fox is horrible at stealing He gives anything back when they say Swiper no swiping Just a girl and her monkey go on crappy adventures,5
42087,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Dora wants kids to yell  Its okay for her to teach Spanish but yelling louder and teaching kids to jump of something What if kids are playing Dora and they jump of a table Do you even like the Grumpy Old Troll to scare kids with his scary lines Swiper the Fox is mean He steals something in every episode Kids will learn stealing  Shes so annoying The laet time I liked watching Dora was when I was 7 Id rather rewatch Team,10
42088,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,The show is just stupid  The characters are just stupid  There is nothing promising about this TV series  It is great for 25 year olds but then it is just idiotic  The show is part of the larger Dora The Explorer Franchise and the creators are more interested in making money off kids,5
42089,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Dont watch it much but its allright,1
42110,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Ugh this show is SO IRRATATING  It gives me a headache  A really bad one  The songs are so annoying the acting is crappy and there is NOTHING good about this crapfest,4
42111,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Parents and kids from ages 07 will love Dora but trust me things will start to change once you hit ages 817  Youll just think that its a bunch o Swiper no swiping trash  Believe me I went through that phase myself  The only reason I still watch this is because I have a 1year old sister going through the short phase in life where she enjoys Nick Jr,5
42112,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Hate it u know what I dont really know where to start but you know what Ill just talk about swiper yea wat is wrong with him when for and her friends go swiper no swiping he goes OOOO MAANN like what is it with him if he is really soo bad y doesnt he just steal it I mean cmon hes one of the worst tv characters Ive ever known about except for mike the knight he is stupid also,1
42113,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,This show is so annoying and lame  I cant stand the songs  They are stupid and annoying  The characters are so crappy  There is not 1 good thing I can think about Dora the Explorer,5
42114,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Okay I can understand some of the hate but theres no need to say its not for kids  Yes Dora does ask where certain things are when they are right behind her but shes trying to let little kids guess  Once your kid is about 6 they will start to hate Dora but toddlers will love it,3
42115,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,This show so bad its almost comical  The plot is screwed up  A girl and a monkey go on crappy adventures  The animation is HORRIBLY drawn the acting is atrocious the characters are unlikeable and the theme song is just horrible  This is the 2nd worst show ever with the worst being Incredible Crew  Please Nick Jr cancel this garbage and dont give it any reruns  Oh and parents skip this crap and try 64 Zoo Lane,7
42116,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,I bleeping hate this show  It sucks  Too much breaking the fourth wall and the songs are so stupid you might think that your brain melted  Yes its that crappy,4
42117,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY I LOVED THIS SHOW NOW WE HAVE THIS STUPIDITY TO DEAL WITH DONT BOTHER ITS BAD ITS SO BAD IT MAKES ME WANNA PUKE BECAUSE IT HAS GONE DOWNHILL DO NOT WATCH Dear God please cancel this show,5
42118,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,How can anyone like this show It is really annoying and it breaks the fourth wall too much  It gives me headaches it burns my eyes and that is my BIGGEST objection to this show  It was good when they broke the fourth wall on Blues Clues but this No way  I can go on and on but my review is just going to be 4 rants on Dora the Explorer  Is Nick Jr REALLY desperate for ratings So desperate they must put on crappy shows jamming in little kids heads Obviously so  Lastly has anyone noticed that Dora and boots walk on a road with NO SIDEWALKS They can get injured  Nick Jr needs to come up with little kid shows that has the abilty to entertain not just little kids but also older kids and adults  But instead they are making crappy shows that give you headaches  I hope this show gets cancelled  RANT 2 When I was watching this crap while babysitting it was so bad I actually felt pain in my chest  Yes it was that bad  Honestly what was Nick Jr thinking I have so many questions for the creator but I cant think of them all  Whats the deal with the theme song It is so annoying  Lastly does anyone else hate that they break the fourth wall too much In Blues Clues they made breaking the fourth wall fun  Blues Clues was my childhood and its a shame Nick Jr took it off the air  Sadly they let Dora stay on the air  No fair  Dora should be cancelled and Blues Clues should return  Blues Clues rules  Dora is moronic and dimented  Dora the Explorer is crap  Blues Clues is much better  OK rant 2 was a little too long  But still Dora sucks really badly  I love to bash shows I hate with a passion and I also love saluting shows I love  Dora is a show I really hate  RANT 3 This show is so bad it hurts  Im not joking I cant believe how bad it is  Who came up with this idiotfest I have LOTS of questions for the creators of this crap but I cant think of them all  If anyone else agrees with me ask the creators of this show some of the questions I have for them  This is the worst little kids show of alltime but its also one of my most hated shows in general  Finally I cant help but notice that they break the fourth wall on this crap  That is the biggest objection I have to Dora the Explorer  It was good when they broke the fourth wall on Blues Clues but this show FAILS at breaking the fourth wall  RANT 4 Is there some kind of inside joke in this show that im not getting This show is super painful to watch  Who came up with this junk I have so many other questions that I want to ask the creator of this show but I cant think of the all  If anyone agrees with me im honored  Lastly has anyone noticed that this show FAILS at breaking the fourth wall Blues clues did a great job at breaking the fourth wall  Dora however is the COMPLETE OPPISITE  Dora and Boots are annoying people  They are such sy characters sorry for the foul laungage  Blues Clues was my childhood and its a shame Nick Jr took it off the air  To make matters worse they put on Dora  Which is moronic crap  Have I bashed this show enough I think so,58
42119,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Well hmm          Dora is okay     but I wouldnt recommend it for kids over 6 But I love Boots I like the culture and Spanish words that they teach  So I think its better than ALOT of shows,3

42323,854번,Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!,7,This was a fantastic  comedy  for everyone to enjoy  Then again what a creepy  movie  ,5
42324,854번,Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!,7,This CGI adventure is clean for the most part and answers questions that readers have wondered for over 50 years Did the Mayor have any sort of relationship with Jojo Do the Whos know their city is a speck in space Who were Hortons friends Did Vlad feel remorse after the Whos made themselves known It just goes on and on  They also added stuff to make it longer like Hortons journey to bring the speck to safety or the existence of Morton or the good Vlad  Really fun story really fun characters and possibly the second film in movie history to exceed the book  The first was The Incredibles  The only bad part is when a malicious Senator calls the Mayor a babbling boob ,9
42325,854번,Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!,7,This is hilarious Jim Carrey was funny in this,2
42326,854번,Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!,7,I KNOW YOU GUYS THINK IS A LITTLE KIDS MOVIE BUT WHEN I SEE IT WHEN I WAS 6 I FOUND THIS FINE AND A LITTLE SCARY,1

42597,870번,Dumb and Dumber,8,If you are a teen then this is a great movie  Very funny and a must watch  Has some inappropriate scenes so 13,3
42598,870번,Dumb and Dumber,8,Even though Jim Carrey has done some pretty decent movies Ace Ventura Pet Detective Liar Liar The Mask there is nothing he does that is quite as hysterical as this one right here Dumb and Dumber,1
42599,870번,Dumb and Dumber,8,Jim Carrey was pretty good in this movie but lots of iffy stuff so be warned,1
42600,870번,Dumb and Dumber,8,The movie is good but the comedy is very immature and woman are very objectified  Sometimes the main characters stupidness is almost painful  Lyod fantasies about having sex with Mary  nothing is shown except for her top half with censored breasts and her lower butt  This is definitely for older tweens who arent very sensitive,4
42601,870번,Dumb and Dumber,8,This movie is just hysterical  I entirely recommend it Jim Carreys character is enough to make you laugh as it is but adding great script writing and just plain dumb humor it makes you burst out with laughter I enjoyed this movie a whole lot  Getting down to the age part there are a few things in this movie but its not too much in my opinion  As for language its pretty mild  The one thing I heard was ass and bitch  There are a few mild moments of sexual innuendo including Jim Carrey telling his friend to tell a girl that he has rapist wits but its used very comical   Jim Carrey also imagines what itll be like when he brings this girls briefcase back and he imagines them dating him at a diner behaving like a martial artist and attacking waiters and he rips the heart out of one guy  This whole scene is entirely comical and it doesnt feel very disturbing  After that he imagines them taking off their clothes and Jim Carrey looks down to the girls breasts and the breasts are then covered by car lights and he wakes up to see a car and that hes still driving  A girl gives Harry a carrot and two pieces of coal to put on a snow man but instead he decides to make it into a penis and testicles and puts it on the lower part of the snowman  In a bathroom scene Jim Carreys character sees a note that says Meet me at 215 in the stall so we can make manly love together and Carrey looks at his watch realizing that it is 215  The man comes in and starts forcingly trying to beat him up or forcingly make love to him but he is interrupted eventually   Some women are seen in bikinis in a car and say that theyre looking for two men to oil them up for the beach or something like that  There are a few referrences to alcohol smoking and drunk driving but its nothing too serious  In the film a man is shot and another is killed by eating hot peppers but to be honest the violence in this film is pretty mild by todays standards  But all in all great movie and I hope youll laugh your butt off watching it,18
42602,870번,Dumb and Dumber,8,Dumb and dumber is sorta funny There are references to banging and some penis jokes  Attempted rape with pubic hair visible  Harry makes a snowman a penis  A man and woman hug and you see her butt he lifts her skirt  They prepare to have sex  Tour bus scene with loads of sexual references  Brief use of shaggin wagon  Explicit boning reference  Harrys butt crack is visible in one scene  Some uses of st py and ahe  Some violence including a scene where a man rips out anothers heart  Not innapropriate  A surprisingly decent comedy,13
42603,870번,Dumb and Dumber,8,About a quarter of the way through this movie my parents realized that maybe it wasnt the best form me age 12 and my sister age 8 to watch  At one part a guy is day dreaming about this girl he likes and he pulls up her dress to see if she is wearing underwear SHE IS NOT we actually saw a close up of her butt yes it was kind of funny but I think that crossed the line  also a lot of unnecessary swears  Finally so many poop jokes  I think that a few potty jokes are funny but when it keeps going for almost two hours it becomes so crude  Do to really recommend aside to a few very funny jokes the rest wasnt too good  And it was wayyy to crude for me,9
42604,870번,Dumb and Dumber,8,So     disappointed,1
42744,873번,Dune,8,My friend told me that this movie sucked  I disagree  I really liked the cinematography and the story  The idea is pretty unique and what humor there was great  There were a lot of great actors in it also  It was kinda violent but the worst of it was a decapitation and the murderer carried the head for a bit  The most sexuality was the mention that the main characters mother was a concubine and not the wife if the father and there are a couple scenes with naked men  There is nothing exposed  Overall it was pretty good,9
42745,873번,Dune,8,This was a wonderful movie and I totally recommend it The actors were great and the scenery beautiful  The violence was not too graphic and if you are mature enough you could definitely watch it at the age of 13,3
42746,873번,Dune,8,Love timothe chalamet and he does an amazing job playing paul It stayed completly true to the book It was amazing,3
42747,873번,Dune,8,Great story effects and soundtrack,1
42748,873번,Dune,8,Dune is a rich scifi universe that I enjoy a lot   The director the same as Blade Runner 2049 makes long shots of the actors to show emotion which might make impatient viewers go insane but I personally enjoyed it,2
42749,873번,Dune,8,I thought it was a great movie  However it did feel a bit slow,2
42750,873번,Dune,8,I have never read the book I literally dont get how people can give this 5 stars and be serious about it  I watched this movie on HBO Max and I was expecting it to be entertaining  It wasnt that good at all  The fight scenes were dumb and look like a kid directed it  The story is ok  Its very confusing and incomplete  There are so many plot holes  I wanted to like it alot but I can only like bits and pieces of it,8
42751,873번,Dune,8,Compared to the awful 1954 movie this movie is a huge step up in every way This movie is definitely a mustsee if you are a scifi fan the movie has a lot of great characters and fantastic visual effects and action sequences,2
42752,873번,Dune,8,Ill keep this short,1
42753,873번,Dune,8,But there was violence but apart from that it was great and I will give it a 10 ,1
42914,882번,Easter Parade,8,Amazing Me my mom and my daddy watched it on public television  It was really funny we love making fun of old movies and there is this one moment where this women is gifted a pug puppy and she hands it to the maid and the maid makes such a disgusted face,3
42915,882번,Easter Parade,8,I watched this movie it is just incredible it doesnt involve any harmful scary violent drug drinking smoking scenes and moments some scenes may be a bit boring for younger children but it is subtitle for 6 and up,1
43331,897번,Elf,7,This movie is very funny and has messages about how you should always have a smile on your face and care about others,1
43332,897번,Elf,7,This movie is downright funny there is plenty of laughs and it never gets old This movie is one of the best Christmas ever made  not only does it keep in rage with its rating PG it is actaully a bit purecleaner than most Christmas movies well the Polar Express is cleanerpurer than this movie  I think this movie is for everyone to see  Although there is one suggestive moment with showering it is not too explicitgrpahic for young kids not to see  There is one upsetting scene where Buddys dad yells at him to get out of his life  But overall this movie delivers the fun and magic of Christmas and the true spirit of it Infrequent mild language crap piss etc  is heard but dont be too worried about that,8
43333,897번,Elf,7,Ferrells gross heartwarming fish out of water holiday story is clever has messages about differences family and belief and has spectacular goofy acting,1
43334,897번,Elf,7,This is SUCH a good film and its great for families There are some very positive messages in this film  There is some language like hell dmn son of a nutcracker up yours and shut up  And some iffy stuff like in one scene Buddy goes to a shopping mall and sees a red bra with white feathers on display and takes it and holds it up so he can see it in other scene he hears a women singing which finds out to be the girl he likes and yet shes singing in a shower naked  nudity is not shown but bare shoulders and arms are  There is also a bit of drinking  Buddy is as great role model because he is joyful and nice and has the Christmas spirit  This movie gets 5 stars and is intended for kids of the age nine and up,6
43335,897번,Elf,7,Elf is amazing It teaches kids to love themselves no matter how different they may be and it teaches kids to value family over everything else The worst it gets is a scene with some alcohol in it but besides that it is cleaner than a germaphobes house,3
43336,897번,Elf,7,Its a great movie perfect for Christmas time I watch it yearly and it never gets old  Not to mention it is very funny  The only reason I rated it 7 is because children under 7 might not understand certain parts of it   It also has a good message in it to always remember the meaning of Christmas and to spread Christmas cheer whenever you can  The father in this movie is a very mean person at the beginning and then changes for the good at the end  That is a good role model,7
43337,897번,Elf,7,This is a funny entertaining classic with good characters and writing  id recommend it for families looking for a fun Christmas movie  My suggested age rating would would be PG parental guidance for mild violence and some rude humour,3
43338,897번,Elf,7,Elf is the story of Buddy the Elf  a man who grows up making toys for Santa in the North Pole  He decides to take a trip to New York City to find his biological father and has several misadventures upon his arrival  This movie is adorable sweet and funny with a couple of iffy spots here and there   Its probably best not to show this to kids who still believe in Santa Claus  Aside from that there is a scene where Buddy innocently goes into the womens locker room so he can listen to the girl he likes singing in the shower and a couple of fight scenes  Other than that its a great movie that your kids will probably love,6
43339,897번,Elf,7,I thought Elf was funny It really shows the Christmas spirit,1
44192,929번,Epic,8,A good plot formed movie however it is not that epic in my opinion,1
44193,929번,Epic,8,Epic is a visually appealing movie but sadly has a derivative storyline  The Positives are The Voice acting Believable acting and most of all each actor fits the character that it portrays the animation Visually appealing nicely designed and fittingly gorgeous the music it fits the movie and is at times on cue with the emotions at hand the pace very fast and finally the messages I liked how it showed that Relationships are important never give up and always forgive  The Negatives are the derivative storyline Pretty much steals Narrative ideas from Avatar The Littles and Honey I Shrunk the Kids the lack of character development Pretty much no characters are developed typical bad guy Nothing about him stands out as well as his background isnt explored clichd fatherdaughter relationship and finally the movie wasnt epic The title is epic and in No way was the movie actually that and was rather small in scope  I would not recommend this film,4
44194,929번,Epic,8,It has good messages as well as not nice swear words,1
44195,929번,Epic,8,In my opinion it didnt quite reach the level of epic but it was good  The scenery was quite magnificent and creative with its majestic colours  Furthermore it was violent but nothing like gore and blood just sword fighting very awesome  Also there was funny scenes but mostly they involve with a slug a very dashing and cool one  However I was disappointed of the way they put the moral out  The character kind of went a bit of track in the solution of defeating the evil and didnt give me a powerful message but a very weak one  All in all the movie had colourful scenes and had a sense of humor but they didnt quite put the moral out very well as for the romance was a bit bad I have to mention and a boring time to time  Thats my opinion though,8
44196,929번,Epic,8,good sometimes boring  i only liked ais ansari,2
44197,929번,Epic,8,Im 10 and this movie was pretty good  it might be a little to violentscary for kids under 7  its not bloody or any thing intense its little guys and the bad guys try to destory the forest  If i could chose the MPAA rating and reason it would be this film is rated PG for Mild Action and scary events for young kids,3
44198,929번,Epic,8,Its a really good movie and it doesnt have any rude parts Some of the parts are really funny Children you celebrities well will probably know Beyonce so kids will be crazy about it but tell the kids that she is only there for beginning part because after that she dies,1
44199,929번,Epic,8,Epic is a nice movie that can create a franchise once again for Blue Sky  It is a very different story and is a fun movie for kids  BottomLine It is fun movie for kids as it has a different story,3
44200,929번,Epic,8,My sister who is 4 years old was very scared of the part of the movie that was about decay and minimen in dead rat bodies but for me it was the best movie of 2013 because I love nature and archery and it has a lot of this in the movie,1
44803,968번,Far from the Madding Crowd,8,My ratingPG13 for racy contentand gory images,1
44804,969번,Far from the Tree,7,you should watch it,1
45525,1000번,Finding Dory,8,I saw it in the theaters for my birthday present  When i saw it I LOVED IT I will tell you that this is one of the best animated drama movies of the year that it was made  For like twenty years or something of all drama films this one is awarded for  APPROPRIATENESS FOR KIDS OF ALL AGES  I mean little kids with no taste of emotion would want to see itMan Im talking like preschool  I think Dory starring in place of Nemo would be something the kids would want to see  Plus the characters during Dorys search for her parents inspire the kids  So lay down on the couch turn on the tv and watch some Finding Dory,9
45526,1000번,Finding Dory,8,This movie is very well appropriate for kids that love adventure  A good part that I saw was a funny part where the otters drove a van Mildly scary no violence at all  I recommend it,4
45527,1000번,Finding Dory,8,I thought finding dory was a good and funny movie because dory cant find her family  she stayed with marlins family until she can find her family she thought her family was dead and final her family was alive,2
45528,1000번,Finding Dory,8,Its supposed to be funny and cheery for little 5 and 6 year olds but honestly I nearly cried at some bits AND IM 11 But they did hide an obvious sexual joke at the start    5 and 6 year olds definitely would not understand  Families When your 5 or 6 year old asks about mummies and daddies and babies blame Pixar and Disney,3
45529,1000번,Finding Dory,8,I think that it is a great film with a great message about teamwork  there is no bad language and it isnt too sad,2
45530,1000번,Finding Dory,8,I find the content in the movie quite offensive  It is definitely not the Pixar I am used to,2
45531,1000번,Finding Dory,8,This movie has you laughing from the first scene to the last one  It is very humorous for kids and adults alike  My mom and I couldnt stop imitating Bailey once we walked out of the theater  The story is about young dory trying to find her parents and introduces a lot of good life skills to kids such as what to do if you encounter a whale shark  Excellent movie and family friendly,6
45532,1000번,Finding Dory,8,I watched Finding Nemo when I was about 4 years old and loved it When this came out 13 years later it was well made  It had a different plot new loving characters plus some very emotional moments  Dory is a great role model because although shes forgetful she never gives up on finding her family and always refers to her childhood to help her in sticky situations  Plus some other characters play great role models like Destiny who always warns and helps Dory and her friends  The film also has great messages involving not giving up and family and sticking together is important  Although there are a couple of scenes that may disturb young children such as when Dory gets separated or a giant squid chases Dory and her friends  Overall amazing made sequel and is a great choice for kids age 6 and up,8
45533,1000번,Finding Dory,8,On par with Finding Nemo,1
45534,1000번,Finding Dory,8,it is a very very good sequel to finding memo  you have to watch finding memo to understand the movie,1
45652,1005번,Finding Nemo,8,Finding Nemo is a really good movie  It can teach children how aquatic animals interact with each other and what they look like  There is one scary scene that involves a menacing angler fish,3
45653,1005번,Finding Nemo,8,This movie is funny not boring so it keeps moving  This movie has very little intense scenes  Bruce the antagonist the shark maybe a little scary for youngsters but I think that Dory and Nemos dad handle it very well  This is a positive well made family movie that is a classic still to this day,4
45654,1005번,Finding Nemo,8,Loved this movie and it also taught me lots about the ocean,1
45655,1005번,Finding Nemo,8,Pixar has made a lot of amazing films but this may just be just the best one yet   Nemo Dory and Marlin are some of the best movie characters for children ever   One thing for parents to understand is that there is a lot of suspense and action throughout that may upset younger viewers   6 sounds about right   By the way theres very little consumerism,5
45656,1005번,Finding Nemo,8,Finding Nemo is a pretty good movie great messages  its a little educational showing all the ocean animals but not too much   Has some scary parts like sharks wanting to eat the fish and at one point some bombs under water go off so some kids might be scared also some moments where some beards try to eat the main characters and a lot of sad moments so I didnt like the movie too much because it was kind of sad a lot but I think a lot of other people would still like it,2
45657,1005번,Finding Nemo,8,Finding Nemo is a fun family film but its important to know that this film has some very dark moments,1
45658,1005번,Finding Nemo,8,I Would Rate This 0 Stars If I Could  First Of All  When Coral And All But One Baby Get Eaten By A Shark I Thought What Why Cant Coral Just Have To Go Somewhere Else For Some Reason And Could Take All But One Baby  The Next Thing Thats Wrong With It Is The Violence  I Mean When Blood Is Shown It Leads To A NearDeath Shark Attack  Also Did They HAVE To Give Darla A Reputation For Killing Fish Beacause She Shakes The Bag Too Hard Why Cant Nemo Just Not Want To Go With Her Beacause He Was Afraid Hed Never See His Father Again Also Does Nemo Have To Be Kidnapped In The First Place Why Couldnt He Just Have Something Special Taken Away From Him The Last Thing Is Its Just Plain Old Boring The Only Reason Why Ive Seen It Twice Was To Try Out The Movie Then I Had To Watch It Again Beacause I Was At Summer Camp  Its Just Plain Old Terrible  Dont Bother,12
45876,1013번,First Day,8,This show is amazing I watched it all in a day and it was short and sweet  The representation is spectacular and shows characters have good character development  I think this show is for 10 because some concepts younger children may not understand  I definitely recommend,5
45877,1013번,First Day,8,Really touching TV series about transgender girl,1
46990,1076번,Frozen 2,8,Boring  Most of it is music and the music is not even good,2
46991,1076번,Frozen 2,8,Loved it quite emotional at some points though,1
46992,1076번,Frozen 2,8,Even though the visuals were great Olaf was at his prime and Panic at the Discos Into the Unknown is excellent the story itself falls short  Also there was too much focus on Elsa  The whole Elsa this and Elsa that was annoying  Anna shouldve been the fifth spirit,4
46993,1076번,Frozen 2,8,This is totally child friendly  There are no bad words or anything inappropriate  There is a lot of singing which kinda made it feel like there was not a main plot but I like this movie and my sisters watched this and they loved it  The characters are silly and creative  There are some intense parts but theyre not really intense but it may be to some really sensitive kids  There are two characters that are a couple which some parents may think that it is not for younger kids and it kinda just depends,6
46994,1076번,Frozen 2,8,Frozen is a good movie in my opinion  Its good at showing the relationship of two sisters its story is standard for a Disney princess movie but it is a good modern interpretation  Frozen 2 is not anywhere near the first  The less focus on characters makes the amazing cast feel seperated  Every B story has almost nothing to do with the final plot points and could be summarized in a sentence  I think some of the stuff with the forest people and Arendelle is good but its few and far between,6
46995,1076번,Frozen 2,8,So this movie has much better quality and the animations are a lot better  The songs are catchy and the plot is really awesome  My jaw dropped a lot when I saw this in theaters a year ago,3
46996,1076번,Frozen 2,8,I really liked it better than the first movieFrozen wasnt really as much of a story OK i gave it 4 stars because it was slightly scary  I have a fear of movies there are only 3 movies i like including this So NEVER take a little kid because Im 100 sure that theyll be scared unless you have a 1ina billon sibling  who is REALLYREALLY brave,2
47122,1076번,Frozen 2,6,I WOULD DEFINITELY SEE IT  ITS SO POSITIVE AND GREAT FOR EVERYONE  I COULDNT STOP LAUGHING  I ALSO SANG MY LUNGS OUT,4
47123,1076번,Frozen 2,6,i loved this movie it had an awesome plot and great music it was just as good as the first movie if not better i loved it and it was so good it really kept me in the plot the whole time,5
47124,1076번,Frozen 2,6,frozen 2 is WAY better than the first one  it answers so many questions about the old movie  and for the parents with younger kids a war is mentioned and elsa almost dies  thats all i have to say,4
47125,1076번,Frozen 2,6,Frozen 2 is a surprisingly good movie I expected it to be half par not near as good as the first one   I went into it expecting the happy sing along mild peril feature that the first one had been  I am here to tell you that this is not the same as the original,4
47126,1076번,Frozen 2,6,Has a few emotional scenes that made everyone in the theater cry      songs were good        new characters were GREAT        I liked it and definitely recommend it,2
47127,1076번,Frozen 2,6,Flawless,1
47128,1076번,Frozen 2,6,No spoilers The whole thing was seriously interesting and engaging Im 16 now and it actually gave me a similar feeling of interest excitement and nostalgia after seeing it that the first one did when I was 10  A lot of teens try to seem cool by acting like theyre too old for movies like these but to me these kinds of movies are all I could really wish for in this world nowadays  The songs are great the score the soundtrackbackground music is great  It could be a little scary at times depending on the kid but my 4 year old sister made it though and loved it despite the moments that she claims she got a little scared  Good amount of everything that makes a movie good family friendlywell made  They did a really good job of carrying the magic over and conveying it in a way that got the teens experiencing the same pleasure and excitement they felt when they saw the first film those 6 years ago  I highly recommend it and any of you too old kids go ahead and give it a chance,8
47129,1076번,Frozen 2,6,I kinda like this because     Well theres a horse,2
47278,1077번,Frozen,8,I think frozen is a nice movie for young children amazing songs a very good movie,1
47279,1077번,Frozen,8,Frozen has SPOILER ALERT tragic not graphic parent death early on  Later the sisters grow up apart and isolated from each other  Also Elsa has to hide her power going so far as to always wear gloves  This is later resolved when Elsa sings the powerful number about being ones true self  Anna meanwhile gets engaged to a man she met on the first day only to learn hes a monster figuratively and goes on to learn that love takes time and trust and honesty  This movies themes are self acceptance sisterly love understanding love takes time and we need each other  All in all its an amazing movie with important themes and wonderious music,7
47280,1077번,Frozen,8,This movie was very exiting,1
47281,1077번,Frozen,8,There is literally nothing worthwhile in this movie  I like the feminist message but its terrible  Dont bother its not worth it,3
47282,1077번,Frozen,8,No Role Models  Its All About Violence And Sex,2
47283,1077번,Frozen,8,I really liked this movievery interesting plot  Cute charactersfantastic animation   Olaf is probably my favourite character  The let it go song was great and had awesome visuals  I really liked this movie for sure,5
47284,1077번,Frozen,8,GREAT family movie Love the characters The movie starts with Elsa and Anna being great friendssisters but Elsas magic makes them drift apart,1
47285,1077번,Frozen,8,Nothing more nothing less,1
47286,1077번,Frozen,8,this movie is forking mint  NOT for children  ELsa shoots her sister almost killing her  this movie encurages kids to MURDER their siblings  Not good for your children  Good for only children to teach them the importance of being an only child,6
47287,1077번,Frozen,8,In the Film i Like olaf the snowman he sings summer melts in a fireplace But stops melting In a home with trolls olaf tells anna to run        while he distrasts them says Hi Im Olaf and I Like Warm Hugswarning these are spoilers so if you have not seen the movie yet maybe stop reading,4
47429,1077번,Frozen,8,Its okay in parts but its a bit slow to start off with  Theres just to many songs and not enough plot I ended up a bit bored  Ana the main character is a bit stupid and aggrees to marry a guy the evening the meet  Elsa is taught to do the exact opposite of what the troll guys say at the beginning and learns to fear her powere  The snowman was a bit annoying and overall I cant really see what everybodies raving on about,5
47430,1077번,Frozen,8,I watched this for the first time in august with my family online for free  While I was watching it I saw the part where Elsa sings Let it go  I thought that was the best part of the movie but everything else Nuhuh  Personally I think the 80s anime series Saint Seiya is better,5
47431,1077번,Frozen,8,Frozen is a great Disney animated movie that will be loved by all ages Both of the Royal sisters send positive messages to viewers  Queen Elsa has a powerful ice magic gift but is too scared to use it for fear of hurting the ones she cares about specifically her younger sister Princess Anna  However once her powers are revealed Elsa soon learns that its okay to be different and others will accept het for who she is  The hit song Let It Go performed by the spectacular Idina Menzel shows that no matter who you are you should never be afraid to just let it go and show off what you can do  Princess Annas strong passion for her sister urges the young girl on a dangerous mission that she might not return from  She teaches people that no matter what family is everything and if you stick together you can acomplish anything from climbing a mountain to surviving a Frozen Heart,7
47432,1077번,Frozen,8,this movie is great  it tells you about sister life,3
47433,1077번,Frozen,8,I saw this movie in a theater and I liked it but I wouldnt recommend it for all kids though but it may be ok for most,1
47434,1077번,Frozen,8,Im not trying to be a sourpuss but well I am a teen girl and unlike most teen girls I hated this movie  There are so many scary scenes think should a 36 year old be watching a character freeze to death a princess almost get stabbed have there hear frozen  Stick with the classics like Beauty and the beast one of my favorite movies  The only character I liked was Sven  And this is not the first movie to teach girls that you dont need a man beauty and the beast Mulan Brave,5
47435,1077번,Frozen,8,Yes I know a modernised take doesnt sound too great but actually I was quite surprised to find out this film was a perfect family film  It has entertaining characters a strong story and       well its just a lovely film and if I was younger I would be happy to call this my childhood film,2
47436,1077번,Frozen,8,bad movie so dont even bother it was 52 good and 48 bad  ViolenceViolence is when a girl which is cursed makes ice spikes and when a girl safe fire at wolves and an ice monster shouts at someone Language not a problem Sex not a problem,2
47437,1077번,Frozen,8,Your daughters will LOVE this movie if they love disney animation princess movies like this one  The movies animation is stunning and beautiful especially the opening sequences with the snowflakes  The animaters did a superb job with the animation in the movie  You also learn that you dont need a guy to save you in this movie  You will love the characters  Elsa is the oldest sister  She is very protective of her family and friend particularly her younger sister Anna  Elsa also melts frozen peoples hearts with love  Elsa loves her sister Anna  She wants to be the person she truly is even though she has ice powers  She wants to let it go and be the person she truly is  Elsa is voiced really well by Idina Menzel  Elsa is a great big sister in the movie and youll clearly see why  Anna is her little sister  Anna wants to find true love but later on in the movie learns what true love really is  Love is putting someone elses needs before your own  Anna is also clumsyloves chocolateand longs for adventure  Anna is a great little sister especially in one scene in the movie  Olaf is a snowman who says  Hi everyone Im Olaf and I like warm hugs   Olaf is a very likable snowman  Hes funny in the movie and a very likable character  You can clearly see why  The movie is based off of Hans Christian Andersons The snow queen  Frozen has more positive messages and isnt dark unlike the story it was based off of  You learn a lot of messages about the importance of sisterhood and family in the movie  Frozen grossed over 1 billion dollars worldwide  Good job Disney You will love the soundtrack in the movie as well as the animation Definitely deserves an A  You will not be disappointed in this film  Its also a classic for Disney princesses all over the world,30
47438,1077번,Frozen,8,The movie is amazing Everything is appropriate the songs are really catchy and it has funny characters Olaf of course,2
47475,1077번,Frozen,8,I thought frozen was a very boring and dissapointing movie  It had 2 princesess  Very girly,3
47476,1077번,Frozen,8,viewers need to know that frozen is an animated movie based on 2 sisters whos parents pass away  there is a really good story behind the movie it tells girls that you dont need a by to love you,2
47477,1077번,Frozen,8,I love the movie but common sense are such liars,1
47478,1077번,Frozen,8,I just love this movie because it teaches little children about love and care for each other and that love is something that happens in a couple days not in love at first sight,2
47479,1077번,Frozen,8,I think Frozen is a beautiful funny and adventurous movie  It contains love but the love is sisterly love between Elsa and Anna  I love it when Olaf says gasp I have my own personal flurry,4
47480,1077번,Frozen,8,it was an ok movie but everyone says its all girl power and thats the most inaccurate thing ive EVER heard first off all the girls have heads too big for their bodies and giant eyes whereas the guys look HUMAN and anna couldnt have made it into the mountains without the dudes help what was his name  and elsa was made out to be a coward  plus im the only person in the world who doesnt like let it go,5
47481,1077번,Frozen,8,It was okay but really wasnt as good as I expected when I saw the trailer  I like the whole moral about true love and I do like that the girl is saved by the girl instead of the boy,2
47482,1077번,Frozen,8,Nothing too scary just some swords and kissing 2 moments but overall you should be fine to take anyone to this movie   But if you take a little 5yearold they might just want to buy everything Frozen after the movie,2
47483,1077번,Frozen,8,it is a good family film  i recermend you to watch it,2
47484,1077번,Frozen,8,This movie is amazing although I wish they didnt make Hans the bad guy I thought Hans was going to end up with Elsa and kristoff and Anna were going to end up together but over all I think it was the best Disney movie ever,1
47534,1077번,Frozen,7,This is one of the best animated movies I have ever seen and I have seen a lot It has great morals and has very high replay video  I saw this movie twice on a computer and once in theaters  This is for all ages,4
47535,1077번,Frozen,7,The movie is so much fun The messages are great and Id recommend it for all ages The movie is so funny and the songs are very catchy  The plotline is original and even adults enjoy it  The songs are so much fun and Olaf has many funny quotes  Amazing movie,6
47536,1077번,Frozen,7,This movie is awesome  Both of the girls are really tough and the animation and songs are both awesome  I can have a song stuck in my head really easily,3
47537,1077번,Frozen,7,I really loved this movie  Unlike an original Disney princess movie its not about finding a prince  Frozen has great lessons and messages but there are also some parts that little kids might be scared of such as spoiler the snow monster Marshmallow and the fight between Hans and the guards and Marshmallow  Otherwise its a great movie,4
47538,1077번,Frozen,7,This instant classic is already a hit with Disney fans around the world  Once you see it you wont be able to get the songs out of your head  For days  Yes it is that good  With quite possibly the biggest plot twist except for that WreckItRalph shocker in Disney history this movie will send chills down your spine every time you see it  The only issue was the condensed story to fit the limited time frame  It seemed so rushed and unplanned  Overall though this movie never fails to impress both the younger and older audiences with both breathtaking animation and showstopping tunes that your daughter wont stop singing,8
47539,1077번,Frozen,7,Sweet movie  I loved it  I might be a dilettante when it comes to movie reviews but this stressed the love between sisters  So sweet,4
47540,1077번,Frozen,7,Perfect for the whole family   Disney movies who knew,2
47541,1077번,Frozen,7,Some scenes may be scary for children A main character almost dies but overall theres no gore virtually no sex related stuff just one kiss no swearing and this is actually a really good movie as a 13 year old I still enjoyed it the songs were pretty good,1
47542,1077번,Frozen,7,I love it I would give it five out of five stars  The movie is about two sisters one has ice powers and the other one is ordinary  Have you seen Tangled If so then you should definitely see frozen  I am totally sure that you will love it,5
47635,1084번,Furious 7,8,I think that this is too much for younger children under 12 I just dont think that younger children would watch this but what I think it is its really just a porn movie,1
47636,1084번,Furious 7,8,Lots of action packed scenes with explosives and car crashes   Some fight scenes with guns   Only a couple curses   The movie itself is very good   Also the soundtrack is really good to   A sad movie that you wont want to miss,6
47637,1084번,Furious 7,8,The 7th fast and furious film says farewell to Paul walker  With great action and extreme stunt  But not for kids not teens as there is swearing and intense peril,3
47638,1084번,Furious 7,8,loved every moment non stop action plenty of car chases few girls in bikinis great stunts bit of swearing,2
47639,1084번,Furious 7,8,Furious 7 was one of my  most anticipated movies EVER  And it did not disappoint  Violence language and moderate nudity with lots of sexual references  Violence some blood explosions gun fights fist fights and plain mayhem  Language Lots of s words 30 probably  15 d words 22 a words 1 f word 12 b words and some others  Sex Pretty strong nudity with rear female nudity for about 1015 minutes with gstring bikinis dancing on poles in a Dubai club scene  Lots of drinking and great models makes this movie a A excitement action flick,8
47640,1084번,Furious 7,8,Violence510,1
47641,1084번,Furious 7,8,A great movie Everything was amazing  I watched it in the cinema with my cousin and younger siblings  My little sister was irritated by the disturbing content but my brother and I loved it,3
47642,1084번,Furious 7,8,This is the sequel to the 2013s hit Fast  and Furious 6except this time there fighting the bad guy Owen Shawns  brother  This sequel is insanely violentcharacters are stabbedshotbashedhave there skulls crackednecks brokenheads bashedother characters fall to there deathlose there limbsor explode to bits  Even though none of the violence is graphic or even realistic is still overthetop  There is also lots of nudityscantily clad womenbreastsand bottoms are seen through panties and brastheres also tons of innuendo and sexual references  There is tons of frequent strong language including 1 fk 20 st ahole bh and son of a bh  This movie is very thrillingawesomeslickand no where near boring but it still is to violent for even the oldest teens  My ratingR for strong violence throughoutbloody imagesdisturbing imagesand some sexual contentnudity,6
48130,1113번,Ghostbusters,6,very very weird pretty bad graphics too  more comedy than scary  not scary at all,3
48131,1113번,Ghostbusters,6,This is a really great classic movie  Its not a masterpiece obviously but its really funny A few scenes needed for skipping like implied sexual content that is never shown but you definitely can tell what is going on  We skipped these scenes obviously so I recommend you do the same  The language isnt too bad  This move now days I believe would be rated PG13 but its still really funny and I think everyone should watch it because its such a  classic  One more question for you     who you gonna call,7
48132,1113번,Ghostbusters,6,This movie was disappointing because of the sexual content and notevencomical stupidity  PG is not a good rating for this movie,2
48133,1113번,Ghostbusters,6,You need to know at the 3rd scene there is a really scary ghost its about 10mins in the movie its when the ghostbusters come to check the library and near the end off the scene the ghost screams and turns in a skeleton and theres another scene when one of the ghostbusters dreams of a ghost and it is not appropriate for younger kids,1
48134,1113번,Ghostbusters,6,This is a really funny movie but has some questionable material,1
48135,1113번,Ghostbusters,6,Good for ages 11  It has some violence sex and swearing,2
48136,1113번,Ghostbusters,6,Ghostbusters is an awesome movie but theres plenty of swearing  I would rate this movie PG13 for the language  Also in most scenes one of the ghostbusters is smoking a cigarette  For a mature audience I definitely recommend this movie,5
48137,1113번,Ghostbusters,6,A LITTLE SCARY FOR KIDS ,1
48138,1113번,Ghostbusters,6,The ghosts look really good animated and so are the proton streams,1
48158,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,My rating pg13 for some violence implied sex some language including 2 dks and smoking,1
48159,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,This movie was just average to me  It was nothing too special just a little comedy that tries a bit too hard  But with all i can say about this movie I can definitely say that this is a classic just because of the stay puft marshmallow man  Over all just a decent movie,4
48160,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,Good movie,1
48161,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,This iconic movie may appear to be a scary horror movie however when you actually sit down to watch it you will realise that it is not at all scary other than a few brief appearances of ghosts  It is worth noting however that there are many hidden sexual innuendos in this movie but whether this movie is suitable for children depends upon whether they understand the sex jokes or not  All in all it is a great and hilarious classic,3
48162,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,Classic comedy is alright but lacks something     ,1
48163,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,I dont feel I even need to write a full review  Its a creative original fun and action packed classic  If you havent already then what are you still doing here GO see it right now,4
48164,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,I LOVE Ghostbusters 1 and 2,1
48165,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,This is my favorite movie but there are a few negative elements I suggest vidangeling out ghost oral sex launguege  This has great messages including teamwork and friendship,2
48166,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,This film is from the 80s and like most films from that timeline it has language the s word is said at least 5 times in the film one of the characters has a dream where he gets Oral pleasure from a ghost  And Peter is a borderline sexual predator  overall great film but not for small kids,3
48167,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,I liked the movie but it can be scary for younger kids It also includeslanguageLots of smokingand in some scenes lots of sex Crude humor is in Ghostbusters too,1
49595,1159번,Goosebumps,7,I love this movie SLAPPPPPYYYY,2
49596,1159번,Goosebumps,7,I went to go see this in the movie theaters when I was seven years old  I thought it was creepy but the laughs are extremely frequent  Now that Im turning ten this year 2017 and Ive watched Poltergeist Coraline The Sixth Sense and The Others this movie is not scary for me,3
49597,1159번,Goosebumps,7,Some monsters may be creepy but nothing to worry about  Not much else to say,2
49598,1159번,Goosebumps,7,it is scary because it is horror,1
49599,1159번,Goosebumps,7,RL  Stine movie is based on a book of goosebumps,2
49600,1159번,Goosebumps,7,This movie was outstanding and amazing  It takes all of R  L  Stines creations and makes something great out of it  The plot and characters are awesome and incredibly likeable and its the cast was great with people such as Jack Black  The animation is amazing and great to watch  There is a bit of kissing and someone brings up drugs once but its not that bad  Its a good movie and has everything a good movie needs  I can not express how much i love this movie  Im sure theres a lot more to say but im just drawing a blank right now  Simply this movie is awesome,9
49601,1159번,Goosebumps,7,This movie is great but includes monsters coming to life  It also has a creepy ventriloquists dummy that comes to life with that horrifying smile of his  But the movie is also very funny  But there is a killer clown in some scenes named Murder  This could scare kids because of the new clown sight reportings  There are also falling in love scenes like a boy and a girl kissing each other on the lips  But other then that this movie is hilarious  ,8
49602,1159번,Goosebumps,7,A very well designed movie starring Jack Black  The only reason I didnt give this five stars is because I wish that it included more of the monsters  I could see myself screaming with happiness if they had the creeps or madam doom in the movie  Any fans of the books will like it will be very happy but anyone who likes a good scare and is NOT a fan of the books might be dissapointed  However there are three particularly scary parts very close together  First the mantis strikes the bus R  L  Stine  is in and a bomb goes off  Next Slappy finds Stine hiding in a amusement park and releases the blob which traps him  Finally the 3 kids are in a ferries wheel and Zach has just finished the story when the hinges go loose and the wheel goes rolling off into the woods  Good but dont show to the little ones,9
49603,1159번,Goosebumps,7,I love this movie,1
49604,1159번,Goosebumps,7,Really good but could be better  Pretty scary for kids under seven   They could use more monsters in it though  The monsters look  real   So good,6
50145,1173번,Gremlins,8,I found out that Santa was not real when I was 9  The gremlins die in a rather violent way but mature 9 year olds can handle this only if they know about Santa,2
50146,1173번,Gremlins,8,My family and I were looking for a good 80s movie  We went to Netflix and saw Gremlins  At first we didnt want to watch it but then when it started it got really funny  Especially Gremlins swinging on the fan,4
50147,1173번,Gremlins,8,This movie is an amazing classic  What people need to know about Gremlins is that there is some violence but most is just gremlins getting killed   There is some blood but most is gremlin blood which is green this might make it seem less violent   Most of the gremlin blood is shown in a few scenes where a mother fights off a small group of gremlins   The only human blood is mostly just scratches attained by character who survive the movie   There is a little language but nothing really bad   In one part gremlins smoke and drink beer   The final confrontation with the last gremlin might scare young kids   Overall this movie isnt necessarily scary and a great classic that is definitely worth watching,9
50148,1173번,Gremlins,8,This film is not your typical boygetspet style film  This came out before PG13 ratings  If it was rerated it would be PG13 like Jaws  This film is intense and surprisingly frightening but a well done job by Steven Spielberg  Gremlins are gruesomely killed along with grizzly human deaths and attacks  Humans are bitten scratched and killed by gremlins  Gremlins mainly jump onto humans and cling on and start attacking  A old woman is killed by them thinking theyre demons trying to take her by her elevating chairs wires are tampered with by gremlins and send it spiraling it up the stairs at about 80 mph and send her through a window  Many car crashes  A man tries to lure out a gremlin with a candy bar he is then bitten and is shown with him lying on the ground with a syringe in his butt never revealed if he was killed or unconscious  Gremlins chase a couple into a house with a snowplow they survive  Most human deaths are off screen leaving the viewer to imagine extremely gruesome deaths  A gremlin is killed in a blender green bloodslime spews everywhere  Another one is repeatedly stabbed off screen  A gremlins shoved into a microwave and explodes into a green bloodslime pulp all over the inside of the microwave  Another gremlins decapitated its head is show burning in a fire place  A kid shoots gremlins with a sling shot off his roof  He fights off another one by cutting Christmas lights leaving the gremlin to fall  It doesnt show if the gremlins die from the fall in this scene  Gremlins burn to death and then explode when a gas leak is lit in a movie theater  Gremlins shootthreaten with guns  A man is shot is the arm with a crossbow by Spike and is then attacked with a chainsaw  SPOILER The leader gremlin Spike is killed when exposed to sunlight  His skin melts off revealing muscle tissue his eyes roll into the back of his head and wails in pain  His corpse falls into a fountain his bones jump out and then melt into a goo  SPOILER OVER Gizmo is somewhat of a good role model of how he follows the rules and refuses to eat after midnight unlike the other gremlins  Once the gremlins turn they become creepy instead of cuddly and may scare young children  Some jumpscares  Constant usages of hell dmn god Jesus Jesus Christ etc  But its mild  Gremlins drink like fishes and smoke  Some gremlins are clearly wasted  Worst in sexual stuff is a gremlin flasher but they dont has visible genitals so is not that bad  One kiss scene  Mild flirting  This is a must see film but for tweens and up  Fine for 11,37
50149,1173번,Gremlins,8,Gremlins was the first horrorcomedy that I watched and I watched it 5 years ago and it didnt scare me  It doesnt have any swear words the violence is tamer than most kids films  Good movie for the family,3
50150,1173번,Gremlins,8,It is so cute when Gizmo drives the little car and when he waves the flag I really enjoyed this movie,2
50151,1173번,Gremlins,8,Okay lets be fair this movie was made before pg 13 was invented but that story about that girls father is devastating to me I really hate storys were people get stuck in there own house and no one knows  I watched this movie when I was like 5 or 6 and I dont remember that part I watched it again and that part was just awful I wouldnt recommend it to any one under 11,2
50152,1173번,Gremlins,8,Cool movie  Its not my favorite but my 7 year old brother really likes it  Hes obsessed Summary WARNING SPOILER ALERT,4
50153,1173번,Gremlins,8,Good movie,1
50154,1173번,Gremlins,8,I think gremlins is a good movie but best for tweens and teens because it has quite a bit of violence and scariness but this is my favorite movie of all time,1
50386,1181번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,So the movie started out a little weird but then it was the usual Rocket Racoon Baby Groot StarLord and Gamora  There are also lot of funny scenes with baby Groot   Then they start fighting bad guys  Later they get attacked but win  Character drama happens here and there  There was a lot of family reunion stuff along with references to the 1st movie  I think any 10 year old should be allowed watch this movie,7
50387,1181번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,This was an amazing sequel and yet again it had a great plot great acting but had more humor and scifi action The film does contain plenty of language including several uses of st dk plus more  Also the film contains plenty of suggestive content  This involves sexual tension between several characters and some mild sexual references  However this film does not skimp on the scifi violence and action and definitely amps it up are than the first film  Just like the first film there is plenty of combat swords guns tasers and shootouts and explosions plus a high body count  Overall this is a great sequel that is great for kids 12 and up,7
50388,1181번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,so awesome  there wasnt anything too bad except for a few fks and st  it was also very funny,3
50389,1181번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,I had no idea what was going on This could have been due that I did not watch the first  It was also very silly in a ridiculous way and there were lots of curse words,3
50390,1181번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,ANOTHER CLASSIC action comedy  with great messages burderned by some content still entertaining,2
50391,1181번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,This movie was hillarious and amazing  It had enough sex jokes to give it its rating but it also had some family friendly jokes that the younger aundience would get  There is one part that I would cover my kids ears for  There is one scene when Star Lords father was talking about his mother and how Star Lord came to Be and Drax asked him if he had a penis and full details about them having sex  He also said that his father would tell him stories when he was a child about him making his mother pregnant  Thats really it for the sexual content  Language is really what you would expect to see in a PG13 movie  St Dough bag Dk ass ass hole Bch bastard and danmmit  I think that this movie is appropiate for kid who know what sex and when it is appropiate for it to happen and can hanndle some language  Hope this helped,10
50392,1181번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,i think that this was even better than the first one i also think that that one review about how it was not good for kids and it lowers  a girl self esteem   newsflash  those girls in the club were robots therefore in my opinion  it was fine  by the way i also watche this in the cinema with my younger brothers ages 8 and 5   and they were not affected at all,4
50393,1181번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,This action packed sequel was more funny than the first movie but the plot was more confusing and not quite as interesting  In the first spectacular film I laughed out loud about two times  In this great add on I must have laughed at least ten more  Baby groot was so much more funny than ordinary groot and he had a hilarious role in the opening scene  Chris Pratt had some very good acting and Rocket the raccoon actually got emotional in a few scenes  The profanity in this movie was not as frequent however it ended up having about the same amount  as the first movie because it was very very long  This movie also had some dazzling effects but it was sometimes pretty brutal  The plot of the movie was a little more confusing because the team split up for some of the movie and it kind of changed about one third through the film  Other than the violence I think something to know that this movie has some sexual content some subtle while some is pretty obvious such as one reference to a mans body parts  However if your child is mature than that would not be an issue at all  There were a few sad scenes and as common sense media already stated a character dies but he does it to save his friends which I thought was a good twist  My favorite character was actually not Groot and in fact a new character named Mantis who is an alien who can sense the emotions of living creatures and even change them  The funny thing is that when she is not using her powers she does not understand emotions so she often gets them mixed up such as a character calls her ugly and this makes her happy  Another major role in the movie is the addition of eighties music which is still used very often in this movie  This is a great movie for a family movie night or to see in theaters with a friend  Thank you for reading my review,16
50576,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,This is one of the best marvel movies I saw ever besides ant man it had action laughs and it was just fun a great marvel movie,1
50577,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,This movie is awesome so let a lot of tweens see this  The violence and swearing is like most other superhero movies,2
50578,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,This is the best marvel movie ever Great comedy great action great storyline Im gonna watch Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol  2 tonight  Im hoping its gonna be good,5
50579,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,It is a great movie but there is a lot of violence and swearing  There is a little consumerism when the movie shows that Peters music player is Sony brand,2
50580,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,This movie is unlike most other Marvel movies in that it has a less dark tone  There is more humour than you may expect and there are several cheerful and upbeat songs to relieve moments of tension  However there is also a lot of fantasy violence which is expected from a Marvel movie set in outer space   There is some strong language and one sad moment however the overall message is positive,4
50581,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,A gang of space oddballs unite to save the Galaxy,1
50582,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,Although being an almost Unknown comic  Marvel did a great job bringing it alive in an entertaining humorous film  If I were u I think u should start watching this franchise,2
50583,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,Quality This is a really good movie and I cant wait for its sequel  Just like all marvel movies its hardcore action but its also hilarious seriously apart from the first scene every scene had at least one joke that made me laugh out loud  Great movie entertaining all the way through I really recommend that you see it,3
50584,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,There are lots of reviews that say that this movie has lots of violence sex etc  But there is really not too many things that are or should be concerning  This movie is definitely one of the least violent marvel movies  I do not know why people are saying that there is so much violence and sex and drugs and swearing,4
50585,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,Great movie but not for the younger children a lot  of swearing in s  t and f  k but very funny and exciting i think this is a movie many people will enjoy,1
50791,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,This movie lacks excessive foul language and sexual themes but is very gruesome and violent  Shows intense bloody and mangled bodies but if you can handle it I would recommend for mature kids 13,2
50792,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,WAY TO VIOLENT NOT JUST NOT FOR KIDS,2
50793,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,This film is fantastic I have nothing bad to say about it  Mel Gibson has definitely proven himself as a high quality director if that was not already evident  Desmond Doss amazing true story is truly inspirational and he represents a good role model for kids  However this movie is way to violent for kids and I would not show it to anyone who is at least 15  The war violence is about as graphic as Saving Private Ryan so it gets pretty bloody apart from that this movie is definitely great for a movie night given that your children can handle the graphic violence,5
50794,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,It is one of Mel Gibson best movies along with passion of the Christ and braveheart  Be AWARE this movie has extremely disturbing violence along with a few swords and a sexual implication,2
50795,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,Hacksaw Ridge is a true story about a man who saved 75 wounded soldiers from battle  The film is extremely violent in a way that kind of affects your soul  There are woundeddead soldiers everywhere there is one shoot of a dead body with intestines coming out  In one scene which I believe was the most affecting and violent scene in the film a mans feet are blown off he looked like someone dipped his feet in a mincer  The man was screaming in pain and some soldiers where saying to let him die  The fact that this stuff actually happens is heartbreaking  This is by far the most violent movie I have ever seen  The profanity isnt so bad  The worst thing said is the Sword  There is one sex scene between a married couple with no nudity and another scene where a naked man is seen training for battle  His bottom is seen about two or three times however it is pretty funny  This movie shows how bad war actually is I usually underestimate the horrors of war since I obviously havent been in a battle  It is mainly about loving your neighbor AND ENEMIES as your self and doing the right thing  If your like me and love war movies then this movie is CERTAINLY for you,14
50796,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,Its a VERY GOOD movie Desmond Doss got the honor he very much deserved But    ITS VERY GORY AND GRUESOME Including a man getting half of his head and brains blown out on to another guy who also gets his chest shot out People flying in the air on fire and screaming in agony a guy on the ground with his legs reduced to strings of blood and flesh and a Japanese leader getting his head chopped off Another thing there is a little bit of nudity not that bad though just a guy naked but it only shows his buttocks  And thats not even all yet its a masterpiece and I highly recommend watching it if your 13 or older  I was 13 when I watched it and I have no regrets watching it at all Well thats all I have to say  I hope this helps you decide to watch it,10
50797,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,This movie is quite good but definitely and this isnt like the exaggerated call of duty reviews  PARENTS IT IS GORY IM NOT JOKING  This movie is extremely gory I know allot of things are but the scenes are quick for the gore they are long  They make sure you can see the gore  So parents definitely 15 or 16  This movie is not for kids it wasnt meant to be  Good movie though,7
50798,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,it is the most inspirational movie you can watch and has amazing role models in it,2
50799,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,This is an amazing film and I would recommend it to everyone  However it does have extreme violence and upsetting scenes that arent appropriate for young teens,2
50800,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,but too much bad violence scenes,1
51489,1206번,Happy Feet,8,I keep seeing all the same things on herea bunch white conservative super religious moms who are flipping out over how offensive and perverted this movie is  Like would you please let it go and shut up already  Lookthe movie has like one or two innuendos in it like a lot of movies do  Get over it  People watching this apparently seem to forget that when the penguins talk about finding a mate they mean finding love and happiness  And when penguins become mates they have sex  Any joke you find too offensive your child will likely be too young to understand  Having sex and mates is what penguins too in the wild  Dont listen to the other reviews telling you how awful this movie is and how its too perverted  The penguins sing to each other  One or two of the lyrics are a bit sexual  Thats about it  Move on and get over it  Your kid will probably enjoy this movie just be aware of a few scary scenes witha leopard seal and youre all good  Please stop getting offended over a bunch of penguins singing old pop love songs to each other  Your kid is eventually going to learn about sex anyway,16
51490,1206번,Happy Feet,8,pengguins shouldnt talk,1
51491,1206번,Happy Feet,8,This my favourite movie of all time,1
51492,1206번,Happy Feet,8,I watched this in school and Ill be honest  it was rather disappointing  While the characters were cute and the message good there were not just innuendos but scenes entirely centered around penguins mating  Personally I feel like the adult humer was a bit over the top,3
51493,1206번,Happy Feet,8,This movie is simply adorable  Lots of cute penguin power with a powerful message of being unique  Definitely a great movie for families  WARNING Only a smidge of scarinessintense scenes  Movie focused around penguins finding mates  film suitable for older children,5
51494,1206번,Happy Feet,8,I saw this movie when I was only three and loved the singing dancing and animals  The message convey in the story is very true in reality today  The songs are live songs so yes they have sexual refreances but the kids wont catch on unless you make a big deal about it  The antichristinan message is not what the movie show rather that believing that someone that doesnt nessassery follow the guidelines is causing all the trouble is very wrong and that everyone is different their own speical way  Perfect for young viewers and older viewers as well  Plus mating is nature stop making a huge deal about it  All animals do it and alot sing to get a mate and keep the circle of life going,7
51495,1206번,Happy Feet,8,Parents if youre are bringing your child to see this movie I think my opinion you should  Why You may ask because theyre children and  the adult jokes will just fly over their heads and they shouldnt be scared of the movie I read that in the parents review its a freaking kids movie Theres nothing to be afraid of And if they do get scared just wait until theyre older,5
51496,1206번,Happy Feet,8,I saw this movie with my family at home and I just couldnt believe all the innuendos packed into this kids movie  It made me extremely uncomfortable  There was no reason for the filmmakers to include so much inappropriate stuff in what could have otherwise been an innocent fun kids movie  This stuff wont just fly over kids heads  Theyll be able to tell by their parents shocked faces that this isnt something they should be watching  DO NOT watch  Very disappointing  I really do think that the only people who should be watching this movie are adults or very mature teens   But even then who would want to watch it anyway Along with the innuendos there are also many racial stereotypes and the movie portrays humans as these monsters that are destroying the planet  All in all this movie is so filled with bad things that no kid will ever get the intended message of being yourself ,11
51497,1206번,Happy Feet,8,This is a KIDS Movie  Bad Parents and some kids,2
51805,1217번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,This film has an interesting storyline but I think its quite gory for younger kids  Ron coughs up slugs and words are painted in red on the walls  Also there is blood on the sword when Harry stabs the basilisk and blood flowing out when Harry stabs a book,3
51806,1217번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,This movie is amazing and it is so cool to watch Harry find out more and more about the wizarding world  Another good thing is that the book is short so they can literally fit everything into the movie,2
51807,1217번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,Yes I know only one scary bit and one cringey bit the scary bit is where the camera is shaking and Rons youngest sister was riting on the walls with blood and the cringey bit is the Phoenix pecking the eyes out of the snake  kinda of camera kinda not in a shadow I dont remember swear words they might be I dont remember and the whomping willow might scare some young kids and other Bits like Children being super scared by the snake including Collin and also Malloy gets hit on the head with a plank of wood and Ron gets sick and like spit slugs Because he had a broken wand and backfired also gildory Lockhart took his wand and he lost hes mind and never know who he was forever  he is a conman,1
51808,1217번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,Chamber of Secrets is grossly underrated  This is a more bloody violent adventure but nonetheless one told beautifully,2
51809,1217번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,This is ok to me it couldnt be any more innapropriate than the first,1
51810,1217번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,It was a really good movie  You like it two But be careful because some scenes give me the wiggles because they are scary Right I hope you like it  Well bye dudes  I just love it when I fly in the ocean,7
51811,1217번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,I preferred the movies while Chris Columbus was directing  They were kinda more childcentered  So 1 and 2 were easier to watch for me but I like all of them  There were a lot of funny things like Fred and Georges faces when they got yelled at for flying the car  And Rons when he got the Howler  The darker and scarier aspects arent that bad either  But nothing can beat the book and thats why theres four stars  There are great messages and role models like all the books and movies  And the violence is very light,9
51812,1217번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,I really liked the book so I decided to watch the movie  I loved it although I pictured a lot of things differently in my head  There was a part near the end that was really scary  All the special effects were really cool But it is very long  Overall I think this is a good movie for families with kids 8 and up due to some scary scenes  Thanks for reading this review and I hope you try this movie,7
51813,1217번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,It is not too scary but the last 15 minutes are scary you may want to skip the last 15 minutes,1
52023,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,I had it for movie night and me and my little brother both loved it  There were only a couple of nasty bits,2
52024,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,Read the book then see it  It is dark and not vary good fore under 13,2
52025,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,Really good movie but it leaves out a lot  Its a little scary someone cuts off his hand harry gets stabbed in the arm and a boy is killed so its definitely not for younger kids,2
52026,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,This is a great movie but there are a few scary scenes,1
52027,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,My sister watched this movie when she was 5 years old  If you watched Prisoner of Askaban you can certainly watch this movie  It is a great movie about teamwork and helping a friend in need  It does show an unconscious body and does have the killing curse in it  There are two final scenes in the film that you have to worry about  One includes Harry and a boys father screaming in peril after his son died  Another is that there is a scene SPOILER ALERT where mad eye moody turns back into his real form without the polyjuce potion and there is a brief moment where his transformation is disturbing  Other than those two I think youll be OK,8
52028,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,It is the BEST movie ever my little brother is 6 and never looked away Some intense scenes and suspense but amazing movie,2
52029,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,I think that the harry potter series are the best books ever written,1
52039,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,Not too much from the book version appeared in this movie  I was really looking forward to the veelas but guess what It got skipped Another major thing they left out were the characters Ludo Bagman and Winky the house elf   I think you should read the book first  Although many parts werent used this film was incredible and we all loved it  Nothing too scary at least not for me and my 5 year old brother,7
52040,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,This is a good movie  I watched the whole Harry Potter series when I was like 10  Watch it with you kids if you think theyll get too scared or skip over the bad parts  If things are inappropriate most likely your kids will not get it unless theyre old enough too  Parents sensor kids too much sometimes,5
52041,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,This movie is epic  I think there is to much violence for younger kids but not much blood,2
52042,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,Scary Most of this movie is kid appropriate but the end is very very scary Good movie though and kids 9  14 will enjoy it,3
52043,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,HARRY POTTER 4 contains mild violence  Thats all parents will need to know,2
52044,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,Although its a bit violent I think that kids will see this movie without your permission I recommend you to watch it with them so you can talk about the message in this movie instead of making them watched behind you backs that is way much worse than watching a bit of violence also kids have seen much more violence than in this movie,1
52045,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,I watched this with my family and I chose not to watch harry getting sliced of the cutting off the hand but honestly it wasnt that scary at all  My sister is 7 and she watched it all,2
52046,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,I think that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was too scary for my little brother who was 4 and was scared in his bed after watching  Spoiler alert The part with the dark lord was a very dark scene and when the dark lord came out of the cauldron it was too scary,2
52357,1219번,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,Harry potter  and the HalfBlood prince book and movie was incredibly awesome We can relate a lot from Harry Potter and learn  great lessons from the series,2
52358,1219번,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,but its ok for what it is  See you on a two parter review,2
52359,1219번,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,I love the Harry Potter books but when it comes to the movies its a complete different story  Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince dived into more of a romance story  Sixteen year olds finding true love and all  But was it a good love story between Harry and Ginny in the movies No Seriously they made Ginny almost emotionless  Book Ginny would never do a thing like having awkward kiss moments and tie shoelaces at the weirdest moment  Not the actresss fault because she did what was on the script  Not just Ginny but Ron too  The screenwriter and director mustve hated Ron because now they give all the credit to Hermione for comforting Harry and Ron just sits there daydreaming at the last scene,10
52360,1219번,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,I thing that this was a great movie It had a good plot line and everything  I saw this when I was about 11 or 10 and I loved it  Now I was reading some of the parent reviews and I thought that it was weird that they thought someone being killed on screen was bad  Now I get your point but it showed no blood or any odious sign that they were dead other than a lifeless body I think this is a great movie for kids 10 because of what I just described  Thanks for reading,7
52361,1219번,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,I think 9 is fine if they are watching with a parent or someone above 12  This movie has violance but not to muchto be scared of  Their is some kissing but the plot is immpecable  I love this movie so much    its my favorite one  I think the whole harry potter franchise should be 10 it isnt bad at all,5
52362,1219번,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,Harry Potter and the HalfBlood Prince is so good only one thing that scared me was the  Inferi   Dumbledores death was also a little scary but over all this is a good movie,3
52727,1220번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,Should be watched  A bit of violence,2
52728,1220번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,I hate this movie  It is very scary  DO NOT WATCH IT,3
52729,1220번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,When writing the book this was my least favorite because to show Harrys puberty she spend hundreds of thousands of words just on the drama in Harrys emotions  But well skip to the movie,2
52730,1220번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,I think this film is very fun to watch with families and has an intense storyline  Personally its one of my least favourites from the series but its still amazing  Should definitely watch,3
52731,1220번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,Ohmygodsogood Even though it was darker than the previous films you find out more about Voldemort  Harry gets angry but his friends help him  Continues the recurring theme of friendship and defeating evil  Ron swears a loooot again but nothing too bad  Again soooo gooooood 10 at least very scary the death eaters and Voldemort kinda freaked me out but thats just me ,7
52732,1220번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,This is a epic movie but there is quite a scary bit near the end with Lord Voldemort  but if you look closely he looks quite funny  There is a new character introduced called Luna Lovegood,2
52733,1220번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,This movie is so good The tension started in the very begging and you want to watch more and more  This movie is appropriate for ages 8 and up  It is outrageous that CSM rated this film 12 and up,4
52734,1220번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,Some violence and fantasy but overall its a great film and I love it   Good female role model in Hermione too,2
52735,1220번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,Harry sauve    de detraqueur le minister de la magie ne le croi pas Voldemort est de retourune nouvelle gerre commenceDombeldor cre L ordre du phnix,1
54148,1250번,Hercules,7,Lighthearted but scary stuff is too much for littlest kids,1
54149,1250번,Hercules,7,I have no Idea how adults come up with the gory and gruesome ratings They is simply animated figthing I think a two year old would find this scary,1
54150,1250번,Hercules,7,This movie was incredible I really like the graphics and editing  I give it a 5star WHAT PARENTS NEED TO KNOW Its a great movie but not so much for young children  I would recommend at least 7 and older to watch  There are partial scenes where Herculess trainer Phil treats girls in a nonappropriate way  Although you cant get mad at Disney  The movie setting is located in ancient Greece so its very common to see things like that  There are scary scenes where Hades forces monsters and terrifying creatures to try to kill Hercules  Which they all end up failing  There is another scene where Hades tricks Hercules into saving two little boys trapped under a rock  The two little boys are actually Hadess helpers Pain and Panic  Of course Hercules ends up getting the rock off of them but then we see a huge monster appear out of the cave and Hercules ends up having to battle it  The monsters or so called Titans are released by Hades which then he makes them try to kill Zeus so he can rule  These monsters might come off as scary to some children  Throughout the whole movie there is no sign of blood  Just bruises and scratches  Some children might find it scary when people die  Their soul comes out of their body and sometimes screams  When Hades enters the underworld he has to feed this threeheaded dog  This might be scary  MY RECOMMENDATION If you are a child 6 years old or under please watch with parent supervision  Other than that it is my favorite movie and I definitely recommend watching it,24
54151,1250번,Hercules,7,This Disney movie is   different,1
54152,1250번,Hercules,7,A not sensitive kid could watch this  Hades is not scary because he is too funny I love his hair too lol  Hercules is tryna find where he belongs and then hes like GASP IMMA GOD or something and meets Meg  Shes disturbingly skinny btw but nice  The little narrator ladies are very cute  Phil chases ladies but hes cool  xd  You should watch One violent scene is when Hercules chops off a hydra head and then more grow back and he almost dies but you can skip over that little part  ,9
54153,1250번,Hercules,7,So I love this movie a lot but its definitely not for younger kids  It had a great story but got really off topic from Greek mythology and could be offensive to that culture  The violence could be scary if a little kid watches it  Also Hercules boyfriend  the best Disney character in my opinion is very sexual and cracks some jokes that are funny but most kids wont understand  This movie has a lot of positive sides and good messages but the violence and sexuality might be too much for some kids,5
54154,1250번,Hercules,7,Loved this film and its perseverance towards what it wants to be  Greek Gods is the way,2
54155,1250번,Hercules,7,Very good Disney classic should be on the low end of PG  This movie is not light on peril and being scary  Not for the littlest to watch,3
54156,1250번,Hercules,7,Im 15 and this has to be my favourite Disney  movie I have absolutely loved it to bits ever since I first saw it,2
54709,1272번,Hocus Pocus,8,As a SUPER fan of Hocas Pocas is the best Halloween movie ever  As everyone has already said it has a lot of the word virgin thrown in  The witch gets a little cuddly with a bus driver but it is honestly not that bad and is comical  If your sensitive with gore you might think that witches talking about tourchering and sucking childrens souls out is bad  But even that is not bad at all  Scary funny and awesome,6
54710,1272번,Hocus Pocus,8,Parents should know,1
54711,1272번,Hocus Pocus,8,This is a great movie  I first watched it when I was 5 and my 3 year old brother watched it with me  Me and him both loved it  When I was little I didnt really remember them talking about virgin,4
54712,1272번,Hocus Pocus,8,For most people Halloween is just Halloween but for some people in Salem Massachusetts its a bit more  The Sanderson sisters are a legend to the people in Salem  It is said that they sucked the life force out of kids to retain their youth  They were caught one day and were hung but it is said that a virgin will bring them back  This movie is a fun Halloween movie for the whole family  There is mild violence but I think most older kidstweens should be able to handle it  There is no sex but there are a few references to being a virgin and a few other mild sex innuendos  Most kids however would not notice it  Mild language is also present in the movie  All in all Hocus Pocus is a really cute movie  I definitely recommend it for anyone during the Halloween season,11
54713,1272번,Hocus Pocus,8,This movies is about 3 witches who come back after 300 years when a boy lights a candle,1
54714,1272번,Hocus Pocus,8,Hocus Pocus is an okay movie  I thought it was pretty funny and sometimes cool  The movie is about 3 kids who go to an old shack that belonged to three witches long ago  They light a candle and the witches come back to life wanting to suck childrens souls out to regain their youth  It is a fun adventure movie but can be scary at times  Fortunately the scariness is funny and not like the scariness in horror movies like Stephen Kings It,6
54715,1272번,Hocus Pocus,8,There is alot of Sx cuz maxs little sister mentions something about something max said that is weird the Madonna outfit is also weird and an elderly couple get in a fight because one of them dances with the blonde witch,1
54716,1272번,Hocus Pocus,8,I think this is a great film but wouldnt recommend it to people who dont want their child to ask what a virgin is because there i slot of talk about that  There is also a part when the kids try to burn the witches to death  I think that this is a great film and you should defiantly watch this,3
54717,1272번,Hocus Pocus,8,It is really funny but there are some scary scenes like there is a zombie that gets his head torn off but still I think it is mostly funny and it is not very scary at all,1
54933,1276번,Home Alone,8,This is a great comedy classic it includes violence and some language,1
54934,1276번,Home Alone,8,0,1
54935,1276번,Home Alone,8,so so good but there are burglurs and the sound of a gunshot and traps over all it is a great movie,1
54936,1276번,Home Alone,8,Fun Movie  There is a spider  Some swearing like st bitch and ass,3
54937,1276번,Home Alone,8,It is a great movie but too much swearing   WAY too much  but it  has a good moral,2
54938,1276번,Home Alone,8,and i recommend it for all ages though the only bad effects is the fire and the iron and buckets though i bet young viewers would laugh,1
54939,1276번,Home Alone,8,Super funny holidaythemedslapstickcomedymovie  Great main character and creative plot  Some of the slapstick parts might be disturbing to really young kids,3
54940,1276번,Home Alone,8,Super funny language is fine and the violence is funny   Honestly this is the best holiday movie ever,2
54941,1276번,Home Alone,8,GREAT,2
54975,1276번,Home Alone,8,It is a great movie and all with funny humor and situations but even with actually especially with the first say ten minutes there is a lot of disrespect going on in the Mccalister home I probably spelled that wrong  No body seems to like Kevin as they call him names like disease jerk le incompetent and so on  There are a few mild swearing as well  Its really not hard to see why they hate Kevin because hes really a brat  He gets angry about stupid things and even calls his mom dummy and comments Families suck He of course learns his lesson and for the rest of the movie the swearing is taken down a notch as well as the insults  The traps he sets for the burglars are comical but sometimes very painful to watch  Most kids might laugh at it but others might just cover their eyes  Overall I think its a good movie just be careful what age you decide to show it to,9
54976,1276번,Home Alone,8,This movie is quite violent at the end with the villains getting burned hit in the head falling down stairs and more  I first watched this when i was six and I was terrified of it  Lots of namecalling and some swearing but there arent any movies without that these days  Ive watched it about ten times none of them because I had to watch it in school or anything and I only watched the Grinch  liveaction twice once in school  Not the best role models but Kevin does tend to be quite independant,5
54977,1276번,Home Alone,8,Words like Hll ss And Dmn  If your kid has heard these words its fine  If not maybe skip it  They also say Shut up Les incompetent Your kids probably wouldnt understand that Stupid and say Ya filthy animal ,4
54978,1276번,Home Alone,8,This movie is really funny and its one of my favs  There isnt a lot of cursing but there is one scene where Santa is smoking a cigarette  It gets violent a little more than half way through the movie but its the best Part A must see,4
54979,1276번,Home Alone,8,Great Family Christmas movie probably saw it the first time when I was 6 years old  There is a lot of comedic violence and a few scenes where 8 year old Keven looks at his 14 year old brother Buffs Playboy magazines  But other than that a great funny entertaining movie the entire family will enjoy,3
54980,1276번,Home Alone,8,This film is so funny  It has cartoonish violence and slapstick comedy  I watch this most Christmass and I never get bored of it  It has occasional use of mild swearing and may be unsuitable for younger children  Love this film,6
54981,1276번,Home Alone,8,This is a mustwatch Watch this movie you will cry for how funny it is This is a great movie for kids  family Although if your child is scared of bad guys sneaking into the house they may want to wait longer because that is what happens although Kevin the main character beats them up and tries to get rid of them in funny ways,4
54982,1276번,Home Alone,8,To be honestthis movie is really funny Nothing is really major except for language,2
54983,1276번,Home Alone,8,it is a great  film for kid 11    It is a comedy that is so funny  it will knock your socks of it has violence language  and no sex  you better watch  soon,4
54984,1276번,Home Alone,8,A great Christmas  classic  It includes funny fails  Tricky traps and endless fun Beware of the language Kevin is mean at first  We dont like when he calls his mom a bad name   Good for responsible 8 year olds,7
54985,1276번,Home Alone,8,Fun and quick witted Caper that will introduce kids to more advanced Heist movies,1
54986,1276번,Home Alone,8,This movie is a survival story about being left home  Kevin the main character had an annoying family and wanted to be home alone  The next day the family left home for Paris in a hurry but forgot Kevin  He began to learn what life was like alone along with the pesky Wet Bandits  At the end the family returned and everyone was happy,5
54987,1276번,Home Alone,8,This is not a bad movie  I love this movie but their is so much profanity I feel like it cannot be just flown by like it is no big deal  The way the parents and the kids talk to each other is unacceptable I would still watch it but mute some of the parts where you can tell profanity can happen,4
54988,1276번,Home Alone,8,Fantastic funny Christmas classic,1
54989,1276번,Home Alone,8,Home Alone is an awesome movie  It isnt violent except for when the kid is fighting two burglars  It has one scary part where his furnace makes a creepy noise  There is also some mild cursing  Other then that it is fine for your kid 8 and up,5
54990,1276번,Home Alone,8,A lot of humor but it can be very scary and inappropriate scenes If you dont like swearing and violence you shouldnt watch this movie,1
54991,1276번,Home Alone,8,Age Rating My Opinion  PG  13 A,1
54992,1276번,Home Alone,8,this was a great movie but can be violent including guns creepy movies  And very frequent language,2
55522,1305번,Hotel Transylvania,6,This movie is really good I think that its hilarious and it has a really good message Ok so violencetheres really no violence besides the scary face thing that dracula does  Sexy stuff none besides two TINY kisses  Language none  Consumerism none  Drinking none  Great movie ,9
55523,1305번,Hotel Transylvania,6,Greta movie for all families  I went to see this movie with my family and I thought This is gonna be a stupid little kid movie   But the movie was awesome  I normally enjoy a good PG13 comedy but this was an awesome movie  And a shout out to autisticcaregvr Really You have nothing better to do You make it sound like paranormal activity or a slasher movie Parents Do not listen to his review  This movie was meant to be a movie about a coming of age movie  Not a demonic movie,9
55524,1305번,Hotel Transylvania,6,This is a cute movie but the kids 5 and under might not get he humor  There is some love not an overdose more like Disney Princess and a lot of stars in this movie The reason why I put language is because of the slight potty humor  teeheehee but at least the boys will be happy Overall a really sweet family movie and a great addition to the movie collection,3
55525,1305번,Hotel Transylvania,6,Vampires Bloodsuckers only make appearances in Rrated and PG13rated movies  Ive never seen a vampire movie for kids but I didnt like it  Sexy and I Know It by LMFAO is played in some scenes and I despise LMFAO,5
55526,1305번,Hotel Transylvania,6,hotel transilvania is a funny movie about draculas daughter who turns 118 years old she wants too see the world and see goes in the end hotel transilvania is a movie about a bond between a daughter and her father,1

55529,1305번,Hotel Transylvania,6,Hotel Transylvainia is suitable for kids 7 and up with some minor scary parts,1
55530,1305번,Hotel Transylvania,6,dracula was funnymavis is hotjohnathan can be annoying at times and the other characters were generally likeable except for the witches and especially the stupidugly unappealing zombies,1
55531,1305번,Hotel Transylvania,6,It is a really good movie   It is really funny  I saw it two times and it even made my parents laugh out loud   My mom covered my eyes when she saw kissing   I took her hands off my eyes   There is a little story where there is fire   Also the mom in the movie gets killed but the dad remains alive   There is some scary music   For little kids there might be some scary parts but otherwise I think it is a really good movie,9
55723,1320번,How to Train Your Dragon,7,This movie is great for kids with imagination or really anyone  It serves as a reminder that social outcast is no good and shows some kickass dragons along the way  If you havent seen it yet I dont know what your doing Give it a watch with your kid or by yourself you wont regret it,4
55724,1320번,How to Train Your Dragon,7,I think that for 10 and up This shows a lot of caring and kind  It is also good for history,2
55725,1320번,How to Train Your Dragon,7,Funny intense may scare younger kids great messages and role models gooood,1
55726,1320번,How to Train Your Dragon,7,This movie is a work of art  Everything just fits together in the end and the characters have great development and the story is incredibly outstanding for a kids film,2
55727,1320번,How to Train Your Dragon,7,How To Train Your Dragon is an animated blockbuster film in which a young boy named Hiccup who befriends a dragon named Toothless  It is a good movie for 6 and up,2
55728,1320번,How to Train Your Dragon,7,It is a very interesting movie its fun and entertaining I have a lot of things in my head and heart that I cant type but I can say that I love that movie and I recommend it to a lot of people please watch the 3 movies and the 2 series,1
55729,1320번,How to Train Your Dragon,7,I have been watching this movie since it came out when I was four years old  I really like that even when every viking expected the main character to kill a dragon he was brave and refused to do it  There was a cheesy crush that the main character had on a girl  The three minor things that I would warn about are 1  Teens talk about the scars they hope to get by battling dragons  2  The main characters Dad gifts him a helmet made from his Mothers old breastplate  3  There were some filler words like the common sense review said such as Thor almighty  I recommend this great movie to anybody who is thinking about watching it,10
55730,1320번,How to Train Your Dragon,7,The end was scary so if you have any little kids ask them if they need to take a break   It has some sad parts but this is a kids movie so it will have a happy ending,2
56162,1331번,I Am Legend,8,Great movie but the bleakest film I have ever seen  The CGI was poor but ok  The film didnt make me feel great to be alive  This only has jump scares and not much gory violence  Good but bleak,5
56163,1331번,I Am Legend,8,Pretty good  nuff said,2
56164,1331번,I Am Legend,8,This film was so good better than expected to be honest I found this pretty emotional like when they all die i cried soo much  it was violent but personally it did not scare me at all just a little violent  Anyway a definite watch oh it also depends on you wether you like this type of stuff for me it was a no scare but if you dont like things that jump out id say it was a no for you,2
56165,1331번,I Am Legend,8,this movie is very violent,1
56166,1331번,I Am Legend,8,This is good I just got this on blu ray at target for 7 50  I watched it and liked it  I thought some scenes were kind of scary  No people get shown eaten  Will does shoot zombies sometimes with no blood  There is no language or sex in this movie  Will is a good role model  I would not recommend this film to kids under 12,9
56167,1331번,I Am Legend,8,intense and very scary but good  some disturbing and sad scenes  also some jumpscenes,3
56168,1331번,I Am Legend,8,I think this is a very good movie  It is for kids from 10  It isnt too fright as they say  It just haves a lot of suspence  The mutants arent that scary  Kids WILL like this movie,6
56169,1331번,I Am Legend,8,Some scary parts  If you cant take that movie go watch my little pony,2
56416,1346번,Ice Age,8,The movie was terrible for me  I think it is only suitable for under 5 year olds who dont understand it and over 8 year olds who are already older  I was very sad about some scenes  I will never forget the movie,4
56417,1346번,Ice Age,8,The cat guy is really weird WALLEGO4MOlover,2
56418,1346번,Ice Age,8,Ice Age is FUN More Fun Than The New Ice Age Movie Collision Course I Recommend Watching The First Ice Age Movie,1
56419,1346번,Ice Age,8,Ice age is one of the best animated  films that I have ever seen it has great laughs great story score and cast too highly recommend it,1
56420,1346번,Ice Age,8,I love Ice Age,1
56421,1346번,Ice Age,8,I will says that is some but jokes but they will mostly hear those butt joke in daycare and school   The are some insane seen   It will teach your kid to trust and working together   Also have reabiltiy to trust again   It is aslo teach kids to not follow in peer preasure  It is funny    I will say it will be good starting shows for those who are learning to talk   It is always better to start earlier    I think those you rate 18 and plus are insane   The seen is a right amount of violence   I am okay to allow the acess with all kids   I seen many parents not supervising the kids and this how crazy you are so dont blame on you   It is better to keep this acess to kids and safe enviroment   I will mind keep your opion and my opion in oppositions    I think this will kids the improtant of trust  workship  teamword  and different meanings of family or herd or flock or school  fish   My 2nd grade teacher said  We are family and spread to school like a wild fire after from the ice age and we litimed to only one bully but he is not as bad as normal school bullys in other countries and states   It stay with also new added motto which is pretty similar to we are family   By the end of the day  We all are just the same  like water and rain,18
56422,1346번,Ice Age,8,Very good movie,1
56423,1346번,Ice Age,8,Ice Age is one of those newer classics   My brother and I love Sid the sloth a lot  He just cracks us up We also like when Diego says Wheres the baby There he is   It was peekaboo   I still feel bad for Manny that he lost his parents to humans but this movie is SO good  I understand why it got 82 in the reviews,7
56424,1346번,Ice Age,8,Parents can know that i like this film  It is amazing Especially if you are a Wooly Mammoth or a Giant Ground Sloth  I know you will like it   oh and by the way it was swell if you like california where they made the film  Bye earthlings  Im just so excited for my next review  My aliens and earthlings I bid you well  Oh and bye the way i like you  Bye,10
56425,1346번,Ice Age,8,As of 2020 there are five Ice Age movies and with the fifth being a failure it doesnt look like it will continue anytime soon,1
56426,1346번,Ice Age,8,Nobody should ever have to lay eyes on that monstrosity of a baby,1
56427,1346번,Ice Age,8,DO NOT let your children watch this terrible movie it truly is an abomination  The Ice Age Baby is maybe the worst thing ever and teaches a terrible messages  Parents should not even watch this they would  probably die,3
56428,1346번,Ice Age,8,I enjoy this film and think the cgi holds up  Has some violence but overall an enjoyable story that the family can watch  I thought it was good but surprised how big the franchise is now,3
56429,1346번,Ice Age,8,This movie is one of the best movie I seen on 2001 Its so unique and it really put the message out and what do you do for a family or your friends that you protect them from danger I think this is a really nice message to this and the movie is so awesome and the best I have seen when I was young,3
56430,1346번,Ice Age,8,Its a toddler movie theres no other way to put it  But the reason for 5 stars is because its one of them special kids movies that all ages can watch  Be curious with toddlers of 2 or under though there is some scary scenes,3
56431,1346번,Ice Age,8,I like this movie  It is about animals adventure,2
56432,1346번,Ice Age,8,Sort of cute movie but Manny is so annoying  Its a pretty cliche movie  Manny reminds me of Calliou and it sounds like his nose is clogged up the whole time    I strongly dislike this movie but the other ones are ok  Sid is just gross he makes me naseous but    MANNY RUINS IT ALL Do not watch,6
56433,1346번,Ice Age,8,okay this was one of the most boringest movies of all time its just so stupid dont watch this stupid movie I shut it off in the first 30 minutes  dont waste your money or time watching this,2
56434,1346번,Ice Age,8,Title says all,1
57736,1390번,Inside Out,8,When I saw the trailerI thought it was boringbut my parents really wanted to watch the movie in theatersso we went there to watch the movie and let me tell youit was amazing I watched it like 3 times now thanks to Netflix  I Like the Animation and story because it just explores your inner emotionsand family  I had a few giggles and laugh but also a little tear at the end  I Highly recommend it to all families World wide Because its my favorite Pixar Movie So far,6
57737,1390번,Inside Out,8,Cute with kind and friendly characters,1
57738,1390번,Inside Out,8,Some mild swearing such as stupid idt etc  and unkindness  One scene involves Riley shouting shut up at her parents,3
57739,1390번,Inside Out,8,Do you really want to teach your childern to get bad habits like swearing when they are angry Would you want them to learn sexist stereotypes trust me you do not want to watch time movie,2
57740,1390번,Inside Out,8,Completely appropriate for almost any age  Beautiful animation good lesson  I love this movie,3
57741,1390번,Inside Out,8,If it is not as good as Toy Story 3 or Lion King it is a close 3rd or 2nd this is one of my favorite films  Kids will love the colorful backgrounds and funny humor and middle and older people will love the powerful messages and jokes  Best Pixar film you can watch it now,3
57742,1390번,Inside Out,8,I thought it was a good movie it was fun funny and also has a good message that both kids and adults can understand and like even if the message is deep  One part that parents might want to know about is one of the core memories include a babys bum being showed with her diaper on her head  It is only shown for a couple seconds as her goofball island part of herself,3
57743,1390번,Inside Out,8,Inside Out is pretty good but sometimes I just think about it like I do with The Good Dinosaur and think    why Dont get me wrong it is a good movie and had good scenes here and there but the whole idea of Inside Out is just weird  It is still kind of creative but I feel like this was the point that Pixar was running out of ideas  It also raises some unanswered questions  The emotions are in peril throughout the movie but that raises the question Can they die If they die how would that effect Riley Bing Bong died so does that mean the emotions could die  Another question I thought was near the end  In the end the mind workers installed a new console for Rileys teen years  It raised the question What happened when they took out Rileys old console That just feels weird and dark  Even though this was Pixars meh its still better than a LOT of Pixar films  Toy Story A Bugs Life Monsters Inc  Finding Nemo The Incredibles Toy Story 3 Cars 2 and Monsters University were ALL worse films than Inside Out  Still Pixar didnt need to make this  If they were gonna make it they couldve at least added more to it,13
57744,1390번,Inside Out,8,I watched this movie and I think its good but BingBong Rileys imaginary friend that is not an emotion in the movie gets forgotten and at the end and all the Emotions are happy but noone knows what happens to BingBong and if hes even happy  Noone knows if Joy kept her promise  I think its quite sad and probably for 9 yrs  up a bit too sad for small kids  It shows what puberty could be like and it kind of scared me  Also there is talk about using swear words plus there is a bit of puberty stuff  I found that the part when Riley decides to LEAVE HOME which I found SCARY is too much for little kids to process  One last thing is that there is one scene is where toddler Riley shows her bum to everyone who is watching  DONT SHOW TO LITTLE KIDS,9
59067,1408번,Iron Man,8,My brother and I where covering our eyes the entire time,2
59068,1408번,Iron Man,8,AmazingOne of the best MCU movies there are,1
59069,1408번,Iron Man,8,I love this movie Iron Man is my favorite Marvel character  He is a playboy so there is some suggestive stuff he says but it would probably go over their heads  There is one scene where they are rolling around in bed but nothing is shown and it is quick and skips to morning  There is swearing but not too much for a mature kid  And the violence is not too bad again for a mature kid,5
59070,1408번,Iron Man,8,Yeah there is some violence and me and my older sister did have to skip the part where Tony and Christine are in bed but I would say its a great film Also I kind of disagree with what Common Sense Media had to say about the bad guys being clearly evil in regards to Obadiah Stane because at first glance hes a very nice man who cares for and wants to help Tony  Nevertheless this is a very great movie indeed,3
59071,1408번,Iron Man,8,I think that iron man is a good movie but it was kind of boring in the middle  I didnt see this one first but it was good  Violence was kind of heavy with a few deaths and blood and a shooting  Sex wasnt much beside the part where the main character has a hookup,4
59072,1408번,Iron Man,8,Iron Man was a amazing movie Rdj Robert Downey Jr does an amazing turn on iron man  Some innuendo as flirting bare backs kissing and assumed sex  Violence is very realistic with terrorism kids held at gunpoint torture among Tony Stark and terrorists  Some alcohol drunken at parties and Tony Stark drinks whiskey very frequently  Tony gambles and flirts at a casino  Iron mans suit is packed full of tank missiles lasers and machine guns  Tony best friend betrays him and uses his technology against him  Overall amazing comic book film with violence and some innuendo,9
59073,1408번,Iron Man,8,I personally love this movie  Its not horribly violent though there are some scenes that I would not recommend a younger kid see  Its funny too  A great movie to watch if youre new the Marvel universe,4
59074,1408번,Iron Man,8,As the first movie in the MCU this one is a favorite for most  It relies less on CGI and more on true facetoface fight scenes  Very stylish  Of course Robert Downey Jr  is the PERFECT man to play the part  Violence isnt too bad but enough to keep the plot rolling  Humor at its finest  Language was mild mostly strong at some parts  Sex was iffy girls wearing croptops and lingerie when drinking with Tony Stark and a few crude statements nothing that would make your kids questions anything  Tony has a reputation as a playboy  Drinking is recreational and mild Tony gets drunk comical but still drunk  A couldbe frightening medical scene  I loved this movie and your kids will too,12
59075,1408번,Iron Man,8,Parents need to know that iron man is a superhero movie that starts it all the MCU  Like all superhero movies there is definitely some intense violence with lots of punching and high tech machines and gun use  There is also quite a bit of war violence on the other hand  There is one scene around 35 seconds of iron man and a random girl making out and implied that they   yeah  Then later appears with barely any clothes  This makes sense later why they put more language and less sexy stuff  Some very mild language including damn one possible a and hell  But he is iron man very funny but may be a iffy choice for young kids Lots of products placements and marvel merchandising,9
59803,1424번,It,8,I watched this movie for the first time just the other day and i anticipated it to be very scarybut i was wrongthe only major bad things are some blood and thats a given with scary movies Also with the swearingyes there are kids swearing but my dad told me that kids would swear in the 80s all of the timewhich is where its set in I am very sensitive to scary stuff because of my anxiety and this was ok for meso just dont watch it if you are a sensitive person,1
59804,1424번,It,8,Right off the bat Im going to say that I say 13 because I watched with friends  My review would probably be different if I watched it alone  I found it kind of scary but being with my friends made it easier  If I were alone Id probably be making this 14 or something  The story is so good and the casting is amazing  Eddie is a sweetheart Ritchie is a king Beverly is a queen and Bill is sweetiepie  Mike and the other dude are kind of lame  Its much less inappropriate than the book  I totally recommend   This was one of my first horror movies and boy was it a great one,10
59805,1424번,It,8,This review has no spoilers  This movie was great and as a horror fan it was even better  I didnt put spoilers in this because i definitely suggest you watch this movie for yourself  Its funny scary kinda suspensful and overall enjoyable  If your over ten and you dont mind scares this is the movie for you,5
59806,1424번,It,8,I was wreally swary I took my 2 year old to see it and they said Best movie EVER  Favourite character was for sure the gay kid he was INSPIWING,2
59807,1424번,It,8,I watched it when I was 11 I thought it was pretty good if your child is scared easily id wait a few years  I love the movie and watch it quite often  Pennywise is a bit creepy for people who do not like clowns  But I would still recommend If you have not watched already I would watch the only part that I wouldnt want little kids to see is when one of the bullys stabs his dad in the neck after pennywise tells him too,5
59808,1424번,It,8,If you say its not scary okay youre fine I hated this movie rude characters young teens say swear words Georgies arm was bitten by Pennywise and a abusing teen girl named Beverley  Pennywise is an Alien dressed up as a clown not his species is a clown  Imagine that It was a SciFi horror movie  These clowns are creepy or not too creepy Not for school people  These creators dont know when they can allowed to say swear words  I thought it was PG13 but its R  It has tons of blood and gore  I love Halloween but this was so trash If you love this movie then shame on you Just stop loving this movie Maybe Rebecca Spark will probably hate this,12
59809,1424번,It,8,Honestly I dont know who would want to watch such movies  The creepy Halloween decorations they have out in the stores scares ME a little still but Im just a sensitive teen,2
59810,1424번,It,8,The origonal IT is ok for kids but not the new one because  it to violent there you go dudes,1
59811,1424번,It,8,yes  IT wouldnt be the best movie to pick if your afraid of clowns but if your not I think IT would be perfect the movie is about 7 outcasts who got bullied previously  fighting this bully but then one of there brothers Georgie denbrough  bills brother goes missing  taken from pennywise the 7 losers go out searching for Georgie and fighting pennywise  the contest behind the movie is to be who you want to be and know that you dont have to be popular to be the star  I will say throughout the movie there is a lot of language and talk on health and there isnt a lot of blood  the movie has the perfect amount of horror and comedy  I personally love the film with a passion,3
59812,1424번,It,8,This movie is great except for the language I think thats why they rated it R  Violence is like in a superhero movie and the little bit of sexual content is supposed to be comical,1
60046,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,Ive seen some kidsteens say its one of the worst movies  Okay I can respect that Holly R says this movie is just creepy,3
60047,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,These reviews you see around you are by a bunch of snowflakes who cant take anything slightly scary  For me this is a classic Ive loved since I was 4 and something that families will be happily watching together  Everything is great from the visuals the character design the stopmotion animation the simple but fun songs and great messages of family friendship and conquering your fears  This movie managed to elevate and expand upon the original book that Ill always see this as the definitive version of the story  Same with director Selicks other triumphant classics of Coraline and The Nightmare Before Christmas,5
60048,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,This movie was terrible It was so boring,1
60049,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,Its on the older side of animation but overall and funny movie great for kids 8  This movies does contain the word ass but thats about it for language  Can scare young or sensitive children  Very little sexual references the centipede flirts with the spider repetitively there is also a scene where the cricket asks the centipede its longitude and latitude but the centipede mistakes the question as asking him the size of his yknow  The centipede replies to the cricket with thats very personality information,5
60050,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,Ive loved this movie since I saw it when I was 8,1
60051,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,I like this movie but I dont think it is appropriate for kids 9 because the aunts try to kill James with an axe and they also abuse him,1
60052,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,As a Tim Burton fan i think the movie was awsome a piece of art,1
60053,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,Okay so first let me say the book is AMAZING  Fun heartwarming and just weird enough to be memorable  The movie though   ugh  First the beginning is TERRIFYING  I wasnt allowed to watch this when I was little and I see why  I mean a giant rhinoceros appears from the sky and basically murders a kids parents leaving him in the hands of his abusive and repulsive aunts  Family entertainment at its best  And the rest of the movie just doesnt make sense  I fell asleep partway through and when I woke up they were   in space And yet I honestly dont feel like I missed out on much  Even the songs are weird somewhat tuneless and add nothing to the plot  I USUALLY love Tim Burton movies but this one was just a disappointment  I only gave it that extra star because the grasshopper glow worm and centipede are hilarious and add just a little whimsy to an otherwise unsettling and skippable movie,13
60054,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,A great movie but the Aunts are really mean and we dont like that bit but I know that its only for he movie and they arent like that in real life and they are just acting  I really like when James is in the peach and having the adventures,2
60055,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,This movie was great   I would have to say that the bugs arent really creepy but thats just my opinion   The movie was an interesting kind of weird   My brother who is 6 says the movie was good and actiony,4
60432,1436번,Jaws,8,this movie is not scary  I heard that some people were afraid to have a BATH after this movie what  there is only a little blood and the scariest thing was hoping my mom would not come in on those parts,3
60433,1436번,Jaws,8,So many parents who watched it in their day  Talk this movie up so much  It is not scary and I think a baby could handle this  But some things to realise is that their are complete idiots in this movie and I know people allergic to jerks  If you thought that was real you shouldnt be thinking about watching jaws ,4
60434,1436번,Jaws,8,Jaws although being old is very scary  There are TONS of graphic shark attacks including a man being eaten alive while he screams in agne and spits up blood  There is also a scene where a sunken boat is found and a dead mans head appears without an eye  Although it isnt that realistic it is incredibly disturbing  The first scene also shows a girl getting naked and then jumping into the water  Jaws is violent but one of the best movies I have ever seen,6
60435,1436번,Jaws,8,This was a fantastic movie Im not a fan of anything bloody but I really did enjoy watching it I think you should wait until 11 or 12 depending on what you can handle  The first scene in the movie is a girl who is attacked by a shark and then a child does which is really sad and we do see some remains of a shark victim that is disturbing dead people and a really disturbing scene of a man tragically be torn to bits by a shark on a boat but other than these things it isnt too horrible  A few jump scares but nothing sexual or to harsh  I just think parents should watch with their children but other than that a pretty good movie,6
60436,1436번,Jaws,8,I think Jaws is a really good movie to watch with family  It can be a little scary at times but it is over all not that scary  There is not that much gore or very graphic deaths  I think it is a great movie but if your kid is more scared of the ocean and sharks then I would say this movie is not for them,4
60437,1436번,Jaws,8,This movies special effects are amazing  The first time I watched this movie I didnt really know what to expect but I actually thought that everything in the movie couldve actually happened  This movie does show blood and people by the shark though the blood is basically only in the water  The movie also shows the characters drinking   I think this movie should probably be watched by 12 because there are a lot of kids who arent exposed to certain things like drinking till theyre older  Over all I think this is an amazing movie 1010 would recommend,6
60438,1436번,Jaws,8,Jaws is an excellent shark film but be aware there is blood violence and smoking  This classic movie does not disappoint as Steven Spielberg movies never do There are a few bloody attack moments but not all shark attacks show blood as well as some few intense jump scare moments that may be to intense for younger viewers  Overall its a great movie to watch,4
60439,1436번,Jaws,8,This is a GREAT classic film  This film In my opinion Is suitable for kids 11 and up  There is some blood and gore but otherwise it should be just fine as long as your kids dont get frightened too easily,3
60440,1436번,Jaws,8,Great horror movie about the hunt for a deadly great white shark,1
60441,1436번,Jaws,8,This an amazing movie and I really do think anyone who is mature,1
61491,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Jurassic Park is a movie about an island that is inhabited by dinosaurs that are kept in cages and enclosures  The dinosaurs were brought back by dna found in a bug that was encased in amber  The park gets visitors and during this tour the power gets cut and dinosaurs go rampant taking over the park and killing scientists and tourists  Alan is one of these tourists and he starts using his skillset to keep two children alive while they fight to get the dinosaurs back in containment,4
61492,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,I think this movie is great and that the dinosaurs are done really well  There is a lot of action and a few bloody scenes but nothing that bad,2
61493,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,This is a great movie It might be a little scary at points but that just adds to the suspense action and terror Some violent areas like a man getting eaten off a toilet and a severed arm on a womans shoulder  Overall a GREAT movie though Hope you enjoy,6
61494,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,jurassic park is a movie that has dinosaurs in a park that shows what they look like and how they act but they get fre and take over the island,1
61495,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Where do I even begin Its amazing  The plot is amazingly original the characters are very enjoyable and than theres the action  Where do I begin The Dinosaurs look AMAZING and the action is excellent creative and amazingly exciting  The acting is spectacular  I cant even put it into words how good the actors did  Flawless,8
61496,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Must see I bet you parents seen this but you are not sure for kids well easy there is chomping the main bad guy Denis died not at the end you think the TRex is bad but you relies the tRex is good and saves the day by eating 4 raptors and the best  classic WHEN DINOS ROARED THE  EARTH banner falls when the tRex roars  A car chase happens and just to say its a exiting scary story that will fill any body up with exiting action even if you hate dinosaurs as you they roared the earth once and not fully a dinosaur movie,2
61497,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Iv seen both Jurassic Park and JawsI personally think JAWS is a little bit better and like both of them  It is intense with some body parts falling off but fine for kids 10,2
61498,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,This movie is one of works of the legendary director Stephen Spielberg and special effects designer Stan Winston the made behind the Terminator Jaws Edward Scissorhands and many more  The movie was released to the world in 1993  Based on the novel by Michael Crichton published in 1990 this movie is a watch for the whole family  It was filmed in Kauai one of the Hawaiian Islands,4
61499,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,I loved this movie had violence but not so bad and langauge and drinking and smoking and a half naked girl in her bra and panties,1
61553,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,This is a very entertaining movie as well scary but not that scary  I really enjoyed this movie my 7 year old sister was a bit scared at some points but I think its fine  I personally think 9 is a,3
61554,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Jurassic Park is about a theme park full of dinosaurs  Before it can go public it needs to be proven safe by a lawyer a mathematician and 2 dinosaur experts  The grandkids of the parks creator also tag along for the ride  And as you might expect everything goes wrong,4
61555,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,I watched this movie when I was 7 and it was fine  If your trying to find a movie to watch with your family pick this Only part that may be frightening for young children is when the tRex eats the guy off a toilet LOL,3
61556,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,I think this movie should have been rated M or PG 13 cause some scenes may be a bit scary  Also towards the end it swung to close to the horror genre,2
61557,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Jurassic Park is a movie classic with peril and slim to none gory violence  The story is about archaeologists that get a opportunity to work at a dinosaur theme park but when a monsoon rolls into the island the dinosaurs in habitat escape  Lots of dinosaur jump scares but most kids and pre teens would be able to handle it  Characters use tranquilizer guns as well as machine guns  Dinks kill each other and humans through biting venom saliva spit and pouncing onto humans dinos  A character loses a arm and scares a main character which could be scary to younger kids  Kids get electrocuted and are in peril through the movie  Mild cursing such as son of a btch sht and damn  Overall great movie that older Kids and pre teens will love,9
61558,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,the is a brilliant movie but also good for younger kids because it could never happen in real life  highly reccomended as long as your kid is not too sensitive  there are positive adult role models  enjoy,4
61559,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Great movie but not for young children,1
61560,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,The Movie includes alot of scifi violence  There are scenes where dinosaurs kill people but it is not gory  Also some language Samuel L  Jackson so it is not for small ones  Great for 1015 year old,4
61561,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Parents need to know that this amazing film by Steven Spielberg is amazing  There is definitely lots of violence some of it quite gruesome involving a severed arm  Lots of terror as well and some language including a few ST and hells and damns and more  Positive role models and messages and helping them from dying of course and some product placements and of screen merchandising,4
61579,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,The classic Jurassic Park is a great movie with some fake animal violence,1
61580,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Jurassic park is a good movie with some blood children in constant peril and realistic dinosaurs  Overall fine for tweens,2
61581,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Astounding film filled with epic and memorable scenes  A great first PG13 film for kids,2
61582,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Jurassic Park is the ultimate combination of great acting terrific special effects and a script that really couldnt get any greater than it is  Since that script is about dinosaurs eating people it can be a very intense movie for some  I wouldnt call it scary as there isnt more than one true jumpscare but the rest of the intense scenes are played out very realistically with a real sense of grittiness and peril  The most brutal scene involves a man getting eaten whole by a T rex but as with all the other scenes theres not much blood  Language never goes too vulgar goddamn son of btch hell one big pile of sht etc  and even at that its few and far inbetween,6
61583,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,All the Jurassic Park movies are amazing but this one is by far the best  Older tweens and teens should be able to handle it  The dinosaurs are very realistic and might scare some younger kids but if they can handle scary things then they should be fine  Theres a lot of violence most if it isnt too bloody but it can still get a bit gruesome  The swearing is pretty mild for a PG13 movie at least compared to more recent PG13 movies it is  The swearing is mostly hell and damn with sht in there once or twice as well as religious profanity like oh my God etc  As long as kids know that dinosaurs arent real and scientists arent going to bring them back they should be fine,7
61584,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Whoever cab87670 is They are a liar,1
61585,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,This movie was the best but I dont think anyone under 14 should watch it it has some blood and gore lots of violence swearing and frightening scenes we also see a bloody animal leg land on a car  Its not your average dinosaur movie  But for 14 and up its awesome,3
61586,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,great classic spielberg film violence may disturb younger audiences and the swearing is a little much,1
61587,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,I watched it with my papaw and i thought it was really good One of my favorite movies overall  The parts i would look into was that When the goat was gone A bloody legarm of a goat landed on the car  The second part is when The girl goes to the shack to get the power to come back on she runs because the raptor chases her and mr arnolds arm slides out on her shoulder she walks forwards and its his arm that had been bit off and was very bloody  they say a few cuss words like 2 or three they say sh and bi,5
61598,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,This is a spectacular movie  The special effects of this movie are astounding and the dinosaurs are extremely realistic   the first thirty or forty minutes of this movie are mostly touring the park which some kids may find boring and want to stop the movie   But make sure they stick with it  because this movie turns into a fantastic thrill ride with suspense aplenty   In this classic thriller characters are almost always in danger   People are killed in this movie but most of the violence is not bloody in fact most of the deaths are not even fully shown   Only for or five people die in the entire movie   There are only two slightly violent scenes in which a goats leg is thrown on a window by a dinosaur and when a decapitated and rather fake looking arm is grabbed by a character which she drops almost immediately and is not shown again   Some blood is shown but it is mostly just scrapes and cuts on the people who survive   Language is scarce and I thought that this film was not scary at all but younger viewers may disagree   Overall I would say that this movie is a great family film and you only might want to preview it  for extremely young and sensitive children,11
61599,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Jurassic Park is a classic fun film for older kids  This film brings awe and wonder with its nice use of animatronic and CGI dinosaurs but with that brings terror and violet imagery  Even as  a mostly blood and goreless film expect character deaths from dinos big and small  While most deaths arent graphic or are done off screen there is one main exception with a scene involving a large dino that jumpscares you and a severed arm landing on another character  Even with the lack of extreme violence its still an intense movie involved peril and pursuit throughout   Sexual content is limited with the main one being a woman in a bikini on one of the staff members computers  Language is moderate with usual curses and 12 uses of the word st  Overall you really have to know your kid  Some kids may be fine with the violence but think its too scary  Others might not like some of the mildlyintense death scenes  I recommend you give it a viewing before letting your kid see it,10
61600,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,This is truly one of the greatest movies ever although the violence is high there a severed arm shown and some swearing to also people are eaten and a mans face is eaten off screen but you see the raptor on the guy getting eaten a man is eaten off of a toilet and a bloody leg is shown but overall its a must see movie,1
61601,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,This movie is definitely strong at some points and weak at others  I felt like in the first act of the movie was dull boring horribly written and not well acted but the second act was absolutely great It had amazing peril and just what i was looking for out of this movie but act three didnt get off that lucky because it gets worse by a bit but overall definitely a movie people should see,3
61602,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Really nothing to worry about  I watched it when I was six I was more fascinated then frightened  Parents Its good to let kids watch cool scifi violence and know a good movie to recommend and discuss with friends Its actually imaginationbuilding and not letting them watch movies can leave them very behind when theyre older Not appropriate for momsthough   My friends parents wouldnt let her watch Harry Potter when she was younger and now shes so set back on all the new action movies everyones talking about at school and very depressed about it,6
61603,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,The movie Jurassic Park is about an islandamusement park with  living dinosaurs  This movie is a classicactionscience fiction movie  The movie centers around two paleontologist that are asked to come see the park by its founder and creator  This movie is about dinosaurs that look very realistic this could be frightening for younger viewers  Characters swear  frequently throughout and one main character smokes throughout the movie  Overall this is a very exciting and well made film  I think it would be great for 13 and up depending on the maturity of the 13 year old,7
61604,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Good film but definitely not for little children  I tried to show it to my 6 year old brother and he got bored at the start  Then I remembered the about the dinosaurs and turned it off   Not that scary but you need a good attention span to pay attention te some of the dialogue at the start   It is not a 12 or it would be a 12 on the box I watched this when I was 10 and that was a good age  Its a PG,5
61605,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,I watched this movie a year or two ago and I still love it to today  This movie is pretty fake but worth watching  The dinosaurs I have an exception for the incredibly realistic giants that are the main reason of this movie,3
61606,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,theres some swearing like sht crap hell  damn son of a bch   dodam  and some blood people shooting dinosaurs  and dinosaurs eating humans,1
61789,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,This game is the best just dance yet It has WAY more songs and more options  It has really nice songs and its a fun way to be exercised  Some parent reviews I just read said the songs with to much sex in it but everything about sex in songs is blurred  One parent said she wont even let her high school son play it but really thats just RIDICULOUS grow up parents They picked out some big pop hits and some classics  Really fun game for people to playso BUY IT,7
61790,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,censored swearing lyrics related to drinking sxual lyrics and themes and thats all,1
61791,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,This is a fun game for all ages to get moving  Best played with a camera to more accurately track movement  Characters can wear suggestive clothing and some lines can be slightly suggestive but it mostly goes over kids heads,3
61792,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,out of all of the just dance games Ive played this one is amazing  its taken a really big step from the previous game  some songs have some sexual references or alcohol references but its not that bad  Ive seen numerous comments saying this game is for people that are 18 and I dont get it  just dance is supposed to be for all ages and if its for all ages all the songs wouldnt be aimed towards only children because it wouldnt amuse the older people who want to play it  and as if the children are going to understand the explicit lyrics along with just dance censoring it  yes some songs meanings are straight up sex but its not like your kid is gonna go oh yea this song is about sex hell yeah lets go fuck a random person at a bar now  so cool or drugs like  omg this song is about drugs lemme go smoke some weed and do some heroin  honestly  they arent gonna understand what it means  and they gotta know someday  overall this game is amazing for all ages and gets everyone off their butt and start dancing  I love it radiates good energy and is great for a family night or a sleepover with your best friends,13
61793,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,When you are stuck in quarantine what is better than move around They have so much fun dances and they have cool songs like kiss you just dance I will survive ghostbusters and YMCA and LOTS of 196090 music These are really fun But it does have some native women with bras  Also some lyrics that say  gimme that yum like a Lollypop  if your kid wants it for a special event you do please make their wish come true ,4
61794,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,The game is pretty good World Dance Floor is a groundbreaking experience  to play with other Just Dancers all around the world  Sad the servers were shutdown for this game,2
61795,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,I think it is great for families and It contains a lot of copyrighted music,1
61796,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,If youre a bit overweight then this is the ultimate fix   This got me back in shape in the span of 1 summer   They have finally added a calorie counter that can be used for all songs and have put less 1D songs thank the Lord   The songs are great and my request was fulfilled more old songs please and Just a Gigolo is there   They have made the songs even more culturally diverse instead of just Indian songs Katti Kalandal and Beware of the Boys they have added Moskau   The songs require a lot of practice but improving is very rewarding   Its motivational to me that I can get coins and spend them on routines in any way or order that I want instead of the game deciding which song I get   This has gotten a bit more racy with the dancer in the Chris Brown song touching his chest and the Gentleman dancer pelvic thrusting and grabbing his crotch   Not for little kids booze and Illuminati was mentioned   I like the Roar song because its self empowering   Two thumbs up from me,11
61797,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,stupidly bad game,1
61798,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,is really bad for kids  There are some songs that are VERY innapropriate,2
61935,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,I watched this with my aunt who is all about girl power and the strength of women  I was visiting her once and when we went to a movie store I found this movie and I have really wanted to see it It was her first time watching Miyazaki and thought it was wonderful  Kiki goes off on her own to live as a young witch and work to help the new community she lives in  Even though it was hard she works hard and tries to do the right thing to benefit everyone  This is probably the best Miyazaki for girls,5
61936,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,everyone can what it  not scary except at the end for little ones no sexy stuff no swearing other than a few insults  great movie  no drinking drugs or smoking,4
61937,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,i thought it was really cool to watch especially if your in the UK and cant get your hands on this DVD   anyway if you like cartoons and a bit of flying magic you will definitely enjoy this its one of my favourite DVDs please watch it,2
61938,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,This is an awesome movie for all ages  It is a very entertaining movie to watch with a good story about a young witch trying to discover who she is  There is no violence or swearing there are some suspenseful moments when Kiki is on her broom stick but nothing scary that will keep kids up at night  It has many good lessons about helping others and being yourself also many good role models  It is still fun to watch for older kids so if your family has older kids and younger kids this is an awesome movie to watch,5
61939,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,Well I couldnt have predicted this After the unabashed feebleness of My Neighbor Totoro I cant say that I was too hyped to watch Kikis Delivery Service  But out of the clear blue sky Ive found a Miyazaki movie that I like even more than Princess Mononoke It shocked me as well  Kikis Delivery Service doesnt share Princess Mononokes grander or epic story telling  But then again it doesnt collapse around itself in the third act Mononokes main problem  The final product is so very whimsical I couldnt help but grin the entire way through,7
61940,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,awesome educational movie,1
61941,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,I was actually hesitant to watch this movie but it did not disappoint  It was very fun and beautifully done  I love how Studio Ghibli always makes it feel like youre in that time  One of my favorite scenes was when Kiki and Tombo ride the bike together very cute  Good scenery animation as usual,5
61942,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,People always say That if I Was Any Movie Character Id Be Kiki  This Movie Is The 4th Miyazaki Film I Have Ever Seen Out of 9 and It So Edge of Your Seat and The Animation is Breathtaking I Think Kikis Delivery Service is One of The Top 30 Best Movies Ever Made,2
61943,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,My family and I loved this movie Kikis so sweet and the same goes for Osono and Jiji This has to be one of my favorite studio ghibli movies,3
61944,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,I love this movie,1
61964,1492번,Kim Possible,6,This movie is full of characters who are suposed to represent girl power  Instead it just holds a girl who runs around with  bunch of gadgets and unrealisticly can outkick and outpunch mean henchmen    a rather skinny girl just starting high schoolas she flips around with a bunch of acrobatic and in the air flips and spins  Not a girl model I would like children to see  My younger siblings even started doing karate type moves after watching it  Not safe for themselves and they may hurt each other   It isnt too different from any modern superhero movie except that it is more cheesy   If you want your girl to get the impresion that she has to act like a tomboy or shes not worth anything than go ahead and watch  Plus the fact that most of the female characters are wearing skin tight clothes,10
61965,1492번,Kim Possible,6,They have to fight Fight a virus Virus,2
61966,1492번,Kim Possible,6,The Kim Possible movie is surprisingly good  Lots of people thinks this movie sucks and while it doesnt top the original I still had a fun time with this movie  It was fun to see these beloved characters and places adapted into live action  And while then clothes arent the best I hardly have a problem with it  Sure this movie has some bad spots but all movies do even great ones  However this movie isnt as kidfriendly as the show,6
61967,1492번,Kim Possible,6,To start off the actor who played Ron Stoppable made my ears bleed  He was such an annoying character who made you cringe more than laugh  He didnt have any likeable traits and wasnt anything like the original Ron Stoppable  The jokes in this movie werent funny and the puns made it worse  They often tried to make it feel more relatable to kids but it came across as trying too hard  The main character Kim didnt do the original character justice  She was very whiny and didnt send a good message about supporting your friends  I had an idea of what I was getting into when I decided to watch this movie but it was still disappointing with how they botched such a funny and creative show,8
61968,1492번,Kim Possible,6,They dont really explain the backstory of Kim but the music is catchy seeing Athenas head in a pile of rubble is freaky espescially since she talking then and the movie overall isnt that interesting and Athena goes from good to bad to good again which is weird but the moral of not being jealous and strong females is ensuring that the writers had good intentions,1
61969,1492번,Kim Possible,6,I think that Kim Possible is appropriate for kids 9 and up because it presents the importance of friendship and teamwork while incorporating kid friendly humor  It teaches kids how to grapple with jealousy and other simple day to day struggles that we kids might not know how to approach,2
61970,1492번,Kim Possible,6,I loved the Kim Possible show but the Movie is just another one of those Disney LiveAction films that ruin the original  Id rather do my homework than watch this,2
61971,1492번,Kim Possible,6,I really like it,1
61972,1492번,Kim Possible,6,Based on what i read is that Kim possible is the best movie and kim possible help people that are in danger that why i like the movie,1
61973,1492번,Kim Possible,6,This movie is amazing It was made last year 2019 it was the best movie ever also kind sad tough but most of it I liked,3
62250,1508번,Knives Out,8,Great movie love the mystery and comedy  This movie is one of my favorites but it has a little too much language that didnt need to be in the movie,2
62251,1508번,Knives Out,8,Very entertaining with a great cast and plot  Its a bit slow at times but the plot twists and ending make up for it,2
62252,1508번,Knives Out,8,Context when I walk into a movie theater I automatically have a negative opinion on the movie  This had gotten to the point where I wasnt sure if this was a good strategy as there was always SOMETHING that made me dislike a movie   And then    there was Knives Out,3
62253,1508번,Knives Out,8,This movie is a murder mystery film it has violence and some cussing  However the characters are wellrounded and clever this is a very good murder mystery movie that is a must watch if you like comedy and thrillers,2
62254,1508번,Knives Out,8,I personally love this movie  I think most kids in 6th grade and up should see it  The cast is phenomenal  Its not surprising but the story line is,4
62255,1508번,Knives Out,8,I LOVED the movie my parents and I saw a ad and we just had to watch it I wasnt very surprised when they said who it was  Your welcome for not spoiling but I think everyone knew who ACTUALLY killed him kind of obvious,1
62256,1508번,Knives Out,8,Plot Google it yourself ,1
62257,1508번,Knives Out,8,cool movie an excellent mystery followed by excellent acting Daniel Craig and Chris Evans A fascinating funny mystery Its cool and epic and for sure a must watch,1
62258,1508번,Knives Out,8,This movie is great fun and great everyone over 11,1
62259,1508번,Knives Out,8,This movie is sooo goood Its so funny but you always are wondering what happened and how did the detective know But parents need to know that there is an affair medicationdrugs a tiny bit of violence and scariness smoking drinking a tiny bit of bloodetc  this movie is good but for kids who can handle that and kids who can handle that only For ages 14 shouldnt have to be mature,5
62367,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,I loved this movie  One of the best of the year  The animation of course is gorgeous and flawless the voice acting is great the action sequences were exciting and surprisingly brutal the score is beautiful and the storytelling is amazing with the main character telling stories with origami  The 3D is unnecessary  Grade A,5
62368,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,Impeccable and majestic beauty Laika is already a strengthened production studio of distinguished films that combine traditional animation with a reserved use of digital technology obtaining an air more craft and realistic technique present in feature films such as the gloomy Coraline or the terrifying ParaNorman Laika has established a great fortitude and prestige in a world in where Pixar prevails year after year Kubo and The Two Strings consolidates the essence of prior all films of the studio while adding something extra courtesy of a timeless visual and narrative magnificence an eloquent feat of 2016 and openly a direct nominated to The Academy Awards,1
62369,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,Kubo is one of the best films I have seen in a long time and I have no doubt it will be nominated for an Oscar much less win  The visuals are absolutely stunning a mix of stopmotion and animation that creates a visual masterpiece  The story and plot are complex and is told in quite a beautiful way  That being said it is a very dark tale right from the beginning with many deaths one very unexpected and sad one many many scenes of peril and VERY intense violence with blood and injuries  Many scenes have very creepy ambiance and tone  The language is pretty tame although there is one use of the word hell in reference to how humans live compared to how another character does  I would say this is for about kids 10 who can handle it  My sensitive 10 yearold brother had nightmares but there were other other younger children who did just fine  However dont let that shy you away from this stunning film as it is also pretty funny and sweet and has a great message about family and love  For more mature audience this is an absolute mustsee,10
62370,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,This is now my favourite movie,1
62371,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,This was a great fantastical movie  Its about a young boy named Kubo who has a mysterious power to make paper shape into little creatures when he plays his shamisen guitarlike instrument ,2
62372,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,In a year of talking animated animal movies Kubo may be far one of the best next to Zootopia  While Kubo isnt exactly a talking animal film Other than a beetle and a monkey this strange stop motion piece of art is really neat and beautifully done,2
62373,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,It is great and I loved it  Something Ive never seen before but doesnt stray too far away from normal  Good lure and original story,3
62374,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,I have to say that the visual affects on this movie is spectacular and good  But on the down side this movie could have been better and not so forced pushed in the end their were some parts that were spiritual in a way also  and also there is a lot of violence for a PG movie  ,4
62375,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,It was cute but the childish characters and the boring slow pace ruined it for me  Also it does get a bit too disturbing but not too depressing,2
62376,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,Scary,1
62377,1516번,"Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter",8,This is not some nice snowy film with an adventure  Its some depressing story you dont want to watch and doesnt make you feel inspired either,2
62378,1516번,"Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter",8,So if you are hoping for an uplifting snowy adventure NO this is NOT what you are looking for at all  It is so depressing it is too long uneventful  So half of the movie she has done nothing except be in her town she is a mentally ill lady who goes into the wilderness to find treasure from Fargo the movie lets down kindness twice throws her rabbit on a train spitting into her boss tea stole his credit card A TERRIBLE MOVIE  and then,3
62379,1516번,"Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter",8,My ratingPG for mature scenes,1
62407,1518번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,Before I say what Im about to say this movie is awesome  The music is great humor is great character development its just great There isnt any concerning violence and other content stays within the PG range  Now that Ive said all of that Im going to say what caused me problems when I first watched this  Part of the plot has to do with Pos past and what happened to his mother and all of that made me cry  But not during the movie but several weeks after  I would literally cry myself to sleep with my mom at my bedside to try to sooth me  In other words be aware of your childs sensitivity when considering this movie  Im okay now and I think the movie is great,9
62408,1518번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,This movie has a little bit more violence and the message is mildly worse  but the movie is my favorite of the 3,2
62409,1518번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,Awesome  I think kids aged 6 and up will love this movie,3
62410,1518번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,I saw this in theaters years agoand I wil sayits awesome  Just like the 1st movieit has a good messageand has great humor  Really worth watching overall,3
62411,1518번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,Out of all the Kung Fu Panda movies this one is without a doubt my favorite and it has always been that way,1
62412,1518번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,I loved Kung fu panda   so why not watch the second one it was a really good sequel   it is a little  Violence    but who cares it was AMAZING it gets you into the Kung fun spirt   so grab a pillow watch the series,1
62413,1518번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,This movie has a deep message that all people should remember no matter what your past is you can choose who you are now  The animation is done very well  Very funny and a beautifully written script  It is centered around Po the panda trying to discover his past so he can find peace  It is inspiring when he finds peace even when he knows Shen was responsible for the killing of his parents  Its a must watch for families  However if your child is adopted you should consider sitting with them while the movie plays because it shows Pos parents abandoning him and this may negatively affect your adopted child,7
62414,1518번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,A bird uses lots of gunpower,1
62653,1523번,La La Land,8,good movie acting was amazing   I just thought muscials were supposed to be haaaapppppyyyyy  Other than that it was an amazing musical  Emma Stone was AMAZING and she has a lovely voice,3
62654,1523번,La La Land,8,This is a great story about never giving up on your dreams and a love story between two people  I would not let your child watch this movie if they are unaware of what the middle finger means  Overall a wholesome movie with a truely amazing soundtrack that made me love jazz music,3
62655,1523번,La La Land,8,Romantic musical with awesome actors and awesome music,1
62656,1523번,La La Land,8,This movie is gorgeous The colors the songs the music the dances and the actors are all so amazing Its hard to explain it with words The story is about two people Sebastian and Mia who are trying to pursue their dreams  Mia wants to be an actress and Sebastian wants to have his own jazz club  After they keep running into each other they decide to pursue their love affair  Will they be able to fall in love and pursue their dreams or not Watch this movie to find out,9
62657,1523번,La La Land,8,I LOVED this movie and I dont usually do musicals  It was very clean with the exception of some language  but it was not too excessive   I wouldnt recommend it for kids because it is just a very mature movie and the ending would be hard for a kid to understandit made me cry  But the story was great it had amazing music and is definitely a perfect movie if youre looking for a romancemusical,4
62658,1523번,La La Land,8,I am in love this movie  I love everything from the songs to the actors to the choreography  I watched this movie with my 8yearold sister and we loved it It is worth the money trust me you will love it  Its not a cheesy romance movie but it is about chasing your dreams,5
62659,1523번,La La Land,8,I saw this when it first came out in theaters and my first thoughts were Ok this isnt to bad about 20 minutes in I realized that it was probably the worst movie Ive ever scene   The plot is terrible and unless you like watching actors act like there professional dancers when they probably have never taken a class in there life youll hate it   About half way through I began to regret some life choices like wasting 2 hours of my life on a movie that doesnt even have a good plot   Once it was over Id decided that I would rather be at the dentist than watching this movie   Its fine for kids ages 7 and up but its not good so just dont bother,5
62660,1523번,La La Land,8,This movie was suburb with great messages  about love and creativity but strong language like F   K and s   T this movie is perfect for kids 9 and up,1
62940,1550번,Leap!,6,This movie had such a rich and powerful message it brought me to tears by the ending credits  It was by far the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life  The music really contributed to the overall feel of the movie  I definitely recommend this movie,4
62941,1550번,Leap!,6,So Im 13 and I personally loved this movie  My 7yr old sister came in my room and turned on this movie  I was doing homework but ended up sitting down and watching it with her  I actually think I enjoyed it more that my sister  There is a bar scene but there is no blatant drunkenness the main plot of the scene is to show  Felici dancing  The movie emphasizes hard work and the importance of forgiving others  I give this a 10 out of 10 a must see,7
62942,1550번,Leap!,6,I saw this movie with a bunch of other teenage girls  We predicted every plot twist and laughed at the cheesy dialogue but thats what made it good  It is definitely unrealistic and silly from many aspects but you have to accept that and enjoy it for what it is  One of the last scenes was a bit scary for little kids  Camilles mother is chasing Felicie with a giant hammer  It would be scary for a young child but other than that it is a pretty safe movie  The messages are good  The protagonist makes mistakes must own up to them and over comes them  Overall this was a good movie,9
62943,1550번,Leap!,6,Makes me want to jump off the roof  Great familyfriendly adventure for 6 years olds  Some scary parts though  LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPP Role models are GREAT,5
62944,1550번,Leap!,6,Great movie for everyone,1
62945,1550번,Leap!,6,I watched this movie in the theatre and I loved it It is a lovely film that mostly follows Felicie on her journey to become a Ballerina  Although the movie glosses over some of the time it took for her to become a ballerina we dont actually know how long it skipped as she practiced all we got was a rehearsal and practice montage and I thought it worked really well I would be able to watch it so many more times and not get tired of it  Also with the homocidal mom my mom told me that in Japan it is so competitive to get your kids into a good preschool that some moms have actually killed other kids  So in a way the movie mom kind of makes sense because she believes Camilles future is ruined  Great Movie,7
62946,1550번,Leap!,6,I first saw this movie on a plane It was called Ballerina  I liked it so much I saw it 3 more times It inspired me to join Ballet classes and Im really enjoying them  The movie  has great messages and role models  It has very little violence and nothing inappropriate for kids It is definitely a very good family movie,7
62947,1550번,Leap!,6,I would say that its good for anyone   But the boy is more of a backup character   And if there are people who mostly want movies about boy inventors then I wouldnt suggest this,3
62948,1550번,Leap!,6,Good for boys and girls  I liked it,1
63122,1564번,LEGO DUPLO WORLD,7,This game or app is only for ages 2 to 4,1
63204,1576번,Lemonade Mouth,8,This movie is all about how a band comes together and becomes famous all from getting into detention dont go to detention kids even though you could end up being famous like these guys but that is highly unlikely sorry to burst your bubble anyway the songs are so good and its a BOP  There is nothing bad but it does include language they speak english but I bet theres versions in different languages tooo,2
63205,1576번,Lemonade Mouth,8,Probably the best Disney Channel movie ever,1
63206,1576번,Lemonade Mouth,8,it has everything singing  craziness silliness and makes you happy,1
63207,1576번,Lemonade Mouth,8,I would say this movie wasnt amazing but its better than any other Disney Channel movie  A lot of the other movies often star a cheerful but annoying tween who has practically no social skills plus almost any main guy character in those movies is almost purely a love interest,2
63208,1576번,Lemonade Mouth,8,I absolutely ADORE this movie and I am almost 15 years old  Its AMAZING and filled with great messages great music and great role models  There is a little bit of romance although I wouldnt exactly call it that  I have no other word  One of the main characters has a boyfriend and she kisses his cheek but there is no lip on lip kissing  She later finds her boyfriend with another girl whos wearing his jacket and touching his bicep  Another main character tells a girl that he likes her but its no big deal,7
63209,1576번,Lemonade Mouth,8,What can I say This movie when I watched it seemed perfect  Despite being GPG rated different sources say different ratings they didnt hold back from adding emotional and tougher scenes which now that Im older I enjoy more and more  As much as I loved it now I dont know if I would have loved it as much if I were younger  I recommend it for kids eleven and up although its great for a movie night with the entire family ,5
63210,1576번,Lemonade Mouth,8,This movie in my opinion is really cheesy and is not worth watching  I mean in one scene out of the clear blue sky everyone starts playing  a song when they just meet as if they have been practicing for YEARS  And in another before theyre first performance a main character Olivia is feeling nervous and then as if it will make the world perfect one of her band mates passes her some lemonade and then POOF Everyone can move on with their wonderful lives  Some of the music was kind of good but in my opinion not good enough to make up for the unrealistic story line,5
63211,1576번,Lemonade Mouth,8,Really good,1
63212,1576번,Lemonade Mouth,8,It is a really good movie with lots of cool songs  I havent seen it in a few years but I still remember Determinate  Also it has a lot of good messages such as defend your friends from bullies and stand up for what you believe in,3
63761,1597번,Lightyear,7,This Is a very nice movie  Love the teamwork and the action  It is a little funny but it is a family movie,3
63762,1597번,Lightyear,7,This is a fun space movie  I have a couple qualms about it however  The movies intro notes that the movie in from 1995 but ironically its the best animated Pixar film to date in my mind  Secondarily and this is not the movies fault people have been interpreting the scene where there is a samesex kiss as a heavily sexualized scene but this is not true  The characters kiss for 0 2 seconds and its edited out in the Disney version  Additionally people seem to not care whether or not straight couples kiss in movies so I dont see the big deal  The movie has a great cast of voices featuring Chris Evans as Buzz doing an OK job replacing Tim Allen James Brolin as a redesign of Zurg Buzzs enemy from Toy Story 2 Keke Palmer as Izzy Hawthorne the grandchild of Buzzs friend Alisha and Taika Watiti as Mo Morisson a hapless space recruit  In terms of violence the movie is okay in the opening scenes there are vine aliens which spray green blood when attacked with a lightsaberesque weapon  Zurgs robots are semiviolent  There are carnivore bugs which attempt to eat Buzz in one scene  Several aliens are electrified on a laser shield but this is not really violent and mainly used for comedic relief  Zurg has a dangerous mech suit which shoots lasers at Buzz and grabs him with a large grappling hook  Zurg also has an evil version of Buzzs robot Sox which appears to be melty and is kind of gross  Zurgs backstory is kind of sad as he SPOILERS is an old version of Buzz who was abused by the various military commanders and went on too many time travel missions causing his friends to pass away and give him the idea he forced them away  A character is often captured by the previously mentioned sentient vines but is shown to escape another is presumably killed by the vines  There are some strange scenes involving scientific depictions of time travel which may confuse younger kids  Explosions are shown but often in a stereotypical manner  Buzz is slightly abused by a military commander who seeks to exploit his skills  Buzz steals a ship from a space headquarters to save the planet but this may be interpreted as flatout criminal activity by your children  Its a pretty okay movie for kids 8 and up and it comes with a cute robot cat so who couldnt resist,20
63763,1597번,Lightyear,7,They worked too hard on the animation and not hard enough on the story  For most of the movie he just tries and fails to get back to his home planet  And then he gives up in the end  The End  Blah  The animation is pretty good though But other than that blah,7
63764,1597번,Lightyear,7,The whole movie had an objective and they didnt even achieve that objective  Started out strong but got weaker and weaker,2
63765,1597번,Lightyear,7,This is an amazing movie  I found it funny and actionpacked  Sox carried the whole movie  The only reason people said it was inappropriate is because there was a 0 2 second same sex kiss That was cut on Disney,4
63766,1597번,Lightyear,7,I is so good buzz lightyear has a amazing adventure throw space it is a family film and you can learn a lot about space from this film which is why I rated this film 5 stars,1
63767,1597번,Lightyear,7,Dont know what the fuss is all about  Great film my 8yearold was a bit confused with the plot thats why I put 9 and older,2
63803,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,If you enjoy 00s Disney films this is a great pick for you  Has many nostalgic elements from many childhoods  I recommend this for ages 6 and up because some scenes can be frightening for younger viewers  Great film,4
63804,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,So Im a teen mom with a 2 year old running around my house I watched this movie when I was a kid and I personally think its a good movie for kids around 5 maybe even younger with their parents around  It is important that they know its not ok to talk to strangers and its not ok to fight but this movie is something for the kids and parents to sit and watch WITH THEM  My little girl can learn values from the movie like family strength,3
63805,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,I changed my mind  I really love Lilo  Stitch because theyre so cool But theyre sister Hona is rude and bossy  But shes okay  The Music is Amazing The Opening was Fantastic The Animation is Awesome And The Characters are very funny I saw this movie when I was a little kid  And I liked it  I laughed at the funny parts of this hilarious and action packed movie This movie is very funny for kids 5 and up,9
63806,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,I have this movie on DVD and think its really touching it teaches kids that sometimes in life things might not always go the way you planned them  it also teaches to respect people for who they are even if there an alien  I also love the connection between stitch and lilo in this movie  the bit were stitch leaves because he feels like he doesnt feel right in lilos world made me cry  really good movie,5
63807,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,Some rude words like stupidhead and butt but I think its good for 6 and up  Some violence but I thought it was great 4 and a half stars,3
63808,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,Most of the reviews here seem to swing dramatically one way or the other  Taken for what it is its a great movie  Its funny sweet a bit of a tearjerker and I just love the round comfortablelooking character design Pretty much every character is likable too even the antagonistic ones are trying to do the right thing,4
63809,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,i love ohana means family and family means no one gets left behind or forgotten and its such a cute movie,1
63810,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,Its good for kids like me yes,1
63811,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,This movie has cute characters many positive role models and laughs,1
63812,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,I think it is a good  comedy for kids 6  Sometimes they yell    There  also a war scene  with shooting cannons and guns  You  should watch this film right now,5
64531,1638번,Lost and Found,4,Im not exaggerating this movie is GORGEOUS  But it might scare or depress little kids  Ex  the graphic and very realistic storm at sea giant octopus rises from the water and turns out to be a freind My sister was scared of the octopus  And tears exploded from her eyes in an emotonal storm when the boy was looking for the penguin  GREAT movie would watch any time  3 stars left out two for the sadness scariness,8
64532,1638번,Lost and Found,4,Nothing is scary in this movie  There were really adorable characters that treat each other sweetly  I love that penguin The octopus looked scary for 1 minute but they were sleeping on the bottom of the boat and the octopus helped them because he was great,4
64545,1646번,Love & Mercy,8,If your ideal movie is a terrible story that has no plot action or conflict I would recommend this one to you for sure  There is nothing bad in the movie a toddler could watch it  The movie is just not good  Its boring as hell,4
64546,1646번,Love & Mercy,8,I love the Beach Boys but not Mike Love  And this biopic kinda missed the mark for me  The 60s scenes were so enjoyable the 90s not so much  If it had been only the 60s I probably wouldve liked it more although I understand the importance of Brian Wilsons life in the 90s  So this is worth a watch  For half of it at least,6
64547,1646번,Love & Mercy,8,This film is absolutely amazing and very different  This movie contains some language especially in one scene and a lot of pot use  There are also some very intense scenes when Brian is having panic attacks and hallucinating  But I highly recommend this film,4
64548,1646번,Love & Mercy,8,My ratingPG13 for racy referencessome languageand drug use throughout,1
64859,1660번,Luca,5,This film has some scary moments but kids will still enjoy and is a positive movie,1
64860,1660번,Luca,5,I am 11 years old watched it with my father and my 6 year old brother,1
64861,1660번,Luca,5,yes,1
64862,1660번,Luca,5,Educational a lot of positive messages such as dont be overprotective parent looks doesnt matter  what you do does teams can do everything follow your dreams,1
64863,1660번,Luca,5,It was a pretty good movie  I had low expectations so I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was better than I thought it was going to be  It has really good meaning and the music is excellent,3
64864,1660번,Luca,5,I watched this with my mom and sister it was good I liked the part when Lucas uncle comes over its really funny Some of the fishing supplies Knives hooks spears and nets were a little creepy because they were all around the town  I enjoyed this movie I hope you do too,4
64865,1660번,Luca,5,i actualy liked this movie  theres nothing wrong with it,2
64866,1660번,Luca,5,A funny movie that gets everybody in the family belly laughing Luca is a brilliant Pixar feature  I would recommend it to any family who enjoy films like Inside Out Zootopia or really any of Pixars amazing movies  But although all the family will deeply enjoy it and want to watch it again and again only 9 will really appreciate the emotional ending,3
64867,1660번,Luca,5,This is a really fun and wholehearted movie that kids will love Its about a young boy who is a sea monster ventures out into a small Italian town to make a new adventures,2
64868,1660번,Luca,5,i still love it maybe a little intense with the fighting and everything but it is still great,2
65291,1687번,Maleficent,8,Maleficent was truly magnificent though I wouldnt recomend it for 7 and under because the scenes are a bit dark and have a little violence  Other then that it was good  The only things that I think relate to sleeping beauty are the set up and cast but Maleficent is a movie in itself  Angelina Jollie and Elle Fanning did a great job as Maleficent and Princess Aurora  My absolute favorite character had to be Maleficent for her brilliant acting  I think it is a good family movie and if I had the chance to I would definitely go see it again,6
65292,1687번,Maleficent,8,When Maleficent was fighting it was a bit too violent but there is a good message later on in the film,1
65293,1687번,Maleficent,8,It was just a dark retelling of Sleeping Beauty  Nothing extraordinary but still good,2
65294,1687번,Maleficent,8,Maleficent is a great movie based on the original fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty but from the villains point of view  The movie does have some violence and some scary scenes which could be disturbing for some children  However Maleficent is a very creative version of Sleeping Beauty that shows a totally different side of the story,3
65295,1687번,Maleficent,8,I saw this movie with my family and it was better than I was expecting  Such a great movie with heartwarming scenes  Although some of the scenes SPOILER ALERT were a bit intense for some kids in my opinion like when Maleficent wakes up and realizes her wings have been cut off and cries out in distress and when Maleficent is trapped in a net which is hurting her  But these scenes are not too intense from my perspective  Another thing is when ANOTHER SPOILER rescues a crow he turns him into a naked man But NOTHING below the waist is shown so it is not that innaproprate  at all and nothing sexual is seen or done  This movie is pretty good and has great messages like not letting anger make you a horrible person and that some men are not as nice as they seem,6
65296,1687번,Maleficent,8,Im ten and I LOVED this movie it is beautiful and surprising not like any other movie Ive ever seen   Very intense and includes a VERY powerful message   I would recommend 910 year olds for good reasons Maleficents anger is overpowers her and can scare younger kids as can the battle scenes but the battle scenes are not as scary as some of the reviews have said  This movie is not quite as scary as some of the reviews have said including the one that says there are decapitated people and a bloody stump which by the way you have to look SUPER close to see any of that,5
65297,1687번,Maleficent,8,Okay the violence is the only thing thats not for younger kids  This movie was very good and the graphics special CGI effects were just awesome  Okay for 10,3
65298,1687번,Maleficent,8,I saw this delightful movie with some friends for a birthday party and we were overwhelmed by how extraordinary this film was  It was about love but not romantic  It was funny at times but a little scary for younger kids  It was a bit violent at times but we went with my friends 7 year old sister and she loved it I was worried when she began crying but she said it was because she was happy that Maleficent didnt die  In the scary scenes she wanted to hide her eyes behind my purse but it was ok  over all it was completely amazing  Maleficent was the best movie Ive seen in years I love this film so much that I am going to watch it again,8
65299,1687번,Maleficent,8,The movie has a good message is funny somewhat saddening exciting and beautiful at the same time  Angelina Jolie was amazing at her part  Great twist on a classic tale,3
65300,1687번,Maleficent,8,Great movie The only bad part about it is when Maleficent gets her wings cut offno blood though just sad  The movie is worth going too  My eleven year old sister and I really enjoyed it,4
65531,1695번,Manny,8,My rating PG13 intense sequences of violence and language,1
65594,1703번,Mario Kart Wii,8,Its a great example and an iconic landmark for gaming  Its a very social family friendly game  Its very fun and can be played for hours as every race is different,3
65595,1703번,Mario Kart Wii,8,This game is so fun Its for all ages and anyone even those who never played any of the Mario Bros  games,2
65596,1703번,Mario Kart Wii,8,i played this game at age 3 the graphic had  bit pixel but good the game had weapons like bombs blue bombs and shells like red shells green shells i still have a copy  of the game im gonna keep the game and copy has a Mario game its not like the 1983 Mario game its Karting game that has some violence but no blood,1
65597,1703번,Mario Kart Wii,8,Mario kart wii is honestly my favorite mk game solely for how many available modifications there are  A few are scams but the real ones like CTGPR make the game really fun and the best Mario kart,2
65598,1703번,Mario Kart Wii,8,I think Mariokart Wii is a fun game and when I first played it with my cousin we had lots of fun playing it and we could not stop  I enjoy playing it today and it is one of my favorite games to play,2
65599,1703번,Mario Kart Wii,8,Mario Kart has a lot of great games but this is one of the best,1
65600,1703번,Mario Kart Wii,8,The first thing to note is that the game is amazing  I recieved the game when I was five along with the Nintendo Wii   The game is fun for the whole family multiplayer is a must play  The only thing to note is that the game can be frustrating for younger kids at first as the controls can be a bit finnicky  In addition its recommended to start out on Automatic Mode versus Manual Mode  This allows you to turn easily without the unnecessary buttons involved  However this comes at a price  It is significantly harder to win on Automatic Mode  And that can be frustrating  However with time Manual mode can seem easy,10
65601,1703번,Mario Kart Wii,8,Its good for the whole family  a fun fast easy to learn racing game with Mario and freinds A bit of cartoon violence but still worth playing if over 6,3
65602,1703번,Mario Kart Wii,8,Fine for kids  Just racing  You can sometimes throw weapons at other characters  No blood  All animated,5
65767,1707번,Mars Attacks!,8,Great cast but strange thing to watch,1
65768,1707번,Mars Attacks!,8,there is a lot of violence characters are set on fire blown up aliens head explodes with green blood but it is all done digitally and very easy to tell its fake5,1
65769,1707번,Mars Attacks!,8,Some really strong violence in this film Characters are burned by lazar guns to the bone a talking human head is scene of the body with blood the president is stabbed through the back Aliens heads splatter with green goo  Some language to like St AssAhole Prick and Crap  Some sexual stuff to like scantily clad women and rumbling camper van which implies there having rough sex  Also some scenes at a casino Social drinking and cigar puffing,4
65770,1707번,Mars Attacks!,8,Trash,1
65771,1707번,Mars Attacks!,8,This is a good movie with some intense scary moments and funny moments  I think kids under 8 will be hurt cause of these scenes,2
65772,1707번,Mars Attacks!,8,This film is funny as hell  The Martians killing everyone may be abnoxious but Funny at the same time  Features an all star cast starring Batmans Jack Nicholson as President James Dale and also plays some person in Vegas  Other cast members include Glenn Cosse and Back To The Futures Micheal J Fox  And of course Tom Jones appears  Sadly it Bombed at the Box Office,6
65773,1707번,Mars Attacks!,8,This is the movie that scifi horror comedy and Tim Burton classic that are all bunched together to make an action packed film that anyone will love  The movie has a COUPLE swear words in it   Also the martians and what they do may as well be kinda creepy this is a great alien movie that anyone would love,3
65774,1707번,Mars Attacks!,8,I watched it when I was 14   I understand why my parents wouldnt let me watch it before that   It is because of the scene where the President gets stabbed   That bit is a bit gruesome and may have freaked me out when I was about 10   I loved the whole movie and has replaced Dispicable Me as my all time favourite movie,5
65775,1707번,Mars Attacks!,8,Occasional cigarettes are seen  2 characters flirt on a TV show very infrequent moderate sex  Horror is too scary for under 8s  Frequent moderate violence and bloodshed e g  A alien in disguise bites someones fingers off and heads explode  At different times in the movie  A peaceful woman refers to being an alcoholic and stopping her addiction  A crucial seen is a casino in Vegas and a husband tells his wife to  play for there anversary   A man refers to aliens as S word heads  Consumerism wise again gambling occurs and the majority of people are rich  However the film is about teamwork to find a plane this is at the end and a woman is purely trying to make peace in her life,10

65861,1718번,Mary Poppins,5,Great classic childrens movie  I had to write a film analysis essay for this movie there are lots of things to praise  Catchy songs and nice character development,3
65862,1718번,Mary Poppins,5,Mary Poppins is an instant classic I first watched this movie in March 2020 with my mom when I was sick  I loved it It took me a few tries for me to understand the plot and stuff  I even have the 50th anniversary DVD of Mary Poppins Its just as good as the sequel that came out 54 years later But I like the first movie better  Mr  Banks can be a little stern Mrs  Banks sings a song about the right for women to vote Sister Suffragette Ellen and Mrs  Brill are supporting characters  Bert is a peppy chimney sweep and the 1960s version of Jack The Lamplighter from Mary Poppins Returns  Mary Poppins is everyones favorite flying and singing British nanny thats always prim and proper and is practically perfect in every way  Anyway if you like fantasies from the 60s Id recommend this one for sure,10
65863,1718번,Mary Poppins,5,when I was younger I would constantly watch this amazing movie it wonderful even though I do not watch this movie on a regular basis anymore whenever I hear someone talking about it it still brings a smile to my face every time  its definitely a must watch,3
65864,1718번,Mary Poppins,5,I saw it for the first time when I was 5 years old it enchanted me right away,1
65865,1718번,Mary Poppins,5,Mary Poppins is a great Disney classic  Many people dub it as Disneys crowning achievement or Disneys ultimate classic and its not hard to see why  Ever since its release in 1964 it has enchanted generations of people  Adding to that this film may be one of the more memorable movies of all time  Fun fact I had only seen this movie once or twice beforehand about 5 or 6 years ago and so many songs and so much of the story stuck with me,5
66004,1728번,Max,8,Max delivers a great message to all viewers  Really hits you in the feel in some scenes,2
66005,1728번,Max,8,This was a really good movie Max was a great touching story There were some sad and violent parts that will make you cry but there are a lot of happy parts too some of those parts make you cry happy tears  If you do not like to cry dont watch this movie if you diced not to for that reason or any other reasons you will regret i  The adventure that this movie takes you on is truly amazing It is also a bit racist and definitly for older kids,7
66006,1728번,Max,8,I am not giving 5 stars because it is sad  It has mild violence action and peril just one kiss and language like friggin one sht damn and hell  Just one part a man offers someone a beer  My rating PG mild violence action peril some language and sexuality and brief language,4
66007,1728번,Max,8,For a PG movie it was pretty violent  But lets talk about the movie  I loved it  Me and my mom really dont see that many movies together because I mean we like Bourne thrillers but this movie was great  I didnt think it was bad at all  Violence was pretty heavy for a PG movie lol  There was gun fights punching kidnapping tense senses were dogs are being shot villain killed by dog RPGS firing at kids no joke and some language such as D words  But other than that it was ok for kids  This girl beside was surprised at the PG rating  But I had fun with it  Good movie ,11
66008,1728번,Max,8,Max is the story of a military dog of the same name  When his owner was killed in Afganistan and comes back home  At first Justin wants nothing to do with the dog until he takes the responsability of caring for it   Max changed him from a bratty teenager to someone who takes responsibility for the things around him,4
66009,1728번,Max,8,My ratingPG13 for intense sequences of war violencesensualityand brief language,1
66029,1730번,Maya the Bee Movie,8,This was a really good movie  I watched it with my sisters Lara and Judi and they think its for babies  But this movie oh hoho this is something else  WATCH THIS MOVIE,4
66030,1730번,Maya the Bee Movie,8,This is a really good movie Its a little scarydramatic but most kids can probably handle this drama  I really love this movie at first I was too scared to watch but it was very funny and good Great message to care about others no matter what other people say,4
66031,1730번,Maya the Bee Movie,8,It is a very cute movie  I loved it when I watched it when I was little  It teaches us great life lessons such as bee youself get it   its not a spelling errorand it doesnt matter what you are and how you look on the outside but it is on the inside that really counts The movie has a lot of adventures in it and Im sure your kids will like it too,2
66032,1730번,Maya the Bee Movie,8,I think it is for kids 4 to 7,1
66193,1736번,Mean Girls,8,I really liked this movie because even though there are some inapropriate jokes its really funny and just makes you feel happy,1
66194,1736번,Mean Girls,8,Mean girls is a hilarious comedy it does have bitch said a few times aswell as fugly slut skeez and hobag  but its not that bad  it does have some refernces to sex and drugs but might fly over someine below the age of 11s head,4
66195,1736번,Mean Girls,8,i think that this movie is a really good movie some of the other parents say its disgusting but me and my mom watched it together when i was like 11  there is no f bombs and the language is not that bad  i think if your at least 10 you could watch it  the only scenes that are kinda weird are the ones that made me uncomfortable they include when regina  george was making out with i dont remember his name and her mom walked in and when an underaged girl made out with the coach  those are the scenes that made me uncomfortable  but over all its a really good movie and i think you should watch it when you get the chance ,5
66196,1736번,Mean Girls,8,This is one of the best movies ever along with clueless and 10 things I hate about u Follows the story of cady heron who has been homeschooled her whole life and lived in Africa  the plastics invite her to hang out with them  The plastics are rich and stupid popular girls and throughout the story there are some good and bad examples  But the end lesson is a rlly good lesson  Theres also a burn book where they gossip mean things about other girls and it teaches that gossip isnt ok  I DEFINITELY recommend,7
66197,1736번,Mean Girls,8,It is a great movie to watch with friends  Even though there is a lot of swearing and sex talk most preteens already know this and watch a lot of shows Movies that talk about it  I think it is for 12 up or kids that are a bit more mature  Overall its a great movie and definetly recomend,4
66198,1736번,Mean Girls,8,People may say that mean girls may have a terrible message and the characters are 3 dimensional but to be honest the whole plot and the society within the movie is so true  It portrays how even though  how nice everyone appears people still all hate each other within  It has a good message too  But its best that children should be more mentally mature to understand the whole plot,4
66199,1736번,Mean Girls,8,Good movie for middle school girls  Its a great movie It will teach them not to give into peer pressure   Many girls are mocked for being whoresvirginslesbiansetc  The teacher tells the girls not to call each other sluts and whores because it makes it ok for guys to call you sluts and whores  Nothing too sexually suggestive except Regina is seen in her bra and a boy named Shane in his underwear   Cady gets drunk and throws up  It has a happy ending although the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the relationship between Cady and Aaron was the most bland thing Ive ever seen in a movie,8
66200,1736번,Mean Girls,8,Your kids should probably watch this after they have the talk or something  Regina is a complete bword and manipulates everyone she meets  Cady is like Regina in one part near the end but mostly a good role model and a victim  Gretchen and Karen are Reginas dumb aword minions  Janis and Damian are OK but Janis can be a jerk but not really  All the adults are terrible role models  There is a pretty decent amount of swearing and a moderate amount of sex references  A little bit of violence as you would expect is a PG movie bloodless and nonscary  A moderate amount of drinkingdrugs   One joke that could be seen as racist  Some pretty good messages like cliques are bad and be yourself  So yeah I think it earned its 14,12
66201,1736번,Mean Girls,8,PG13 for sexual content strong language drinking and violence and a teen story,1
67691,1780번,Minecraft,8,Minecraft has been my favorite game since I was a kid Its fun interactive and you can see how much the producers really care about their community sure there is fighting but nor gore or blood and very little violence it also influences learning and strategy  Just so you know this is the same game that kicked Roblox and Fortnite off their thrones as the most famous games in the world so it may not look like much but try it youll like,3
67692,1780번,Minecraft,8,I see so many parents saying 18 super violent you can attack zombies  Are you kidding me That just sounds like someone who didnt like the game but cant come up with an excuse for why not  Minecraft was the first video game i ever owned and i get nostalgic thinking about it  You can build whatever you want and create entire worlds  Its perfect for someone like me who is currently creating a fantasy world by them self  Or maybe youre a kid who wants something to do to kill time  Or maybe youre a gamer who wants to go from start to finish in survival mode and beat the game in hardcore  Either way Minecraft is a great game for pretty much anyone,9
67693,1780번,Minecraft,8,I LOVE this game  It is so fun and has lots of educational value  It teaches kids how to build things and let their imagination run free  I recommend this to anyone,4
67694,1780번,Minecraft,8,I personally think this game is the best sandbox game  There are some differences from Windows 10 and Java edition  If I were you I would choose Java edition  When you first load into the world you are greeted with a tutorial on one of the top corners of the screen  I would recommend practicing the game in creative mode before going into survival mode  This game can and will take quite a bit of skill and training before actually playing it  I would be weary about joining servers  Depending on the people online you can either have a good or bad experience  There are some people that can bypass the filter and curse  I will recommend you get better at the game before using servers  Being the Teen that I am I rate Minecraft with a 5staf rating  Dont judge Minecraft just by YouTube videos made online,12
67695,1780번,Minecraft,8,You can do o much i recomend,1
67696,1780번,Minecraft,8,Very good game,2
67809,1780번,Minecraft,8,my moms always says im a slow learner  im 10 but im not too good at gramar  u dont need to know gramar for this game its just fun  my mom hasnt told me not to play this so i think its good  i go to church 3 times a week,5
67810,1780번,Minecraft,8,This game is fun can be educational and teaches kids about the value of hardwork  In this game you start on a world you have nothing but the trees and animals surrounding you  You need tobreak trees to get weapons and building materials  You can kill animals no blood to collect food and materials  Be sure to get into a shelter and night as zombies and other monsters will appear  Your challenge is to survive  If you find survival mode to difficult go onto creative mode which enables you to fly and have unlimited health and resources  If you havent got this game by now you need to get it  This game will be a classic for years to come  There are also a large variety of mods to play with  In this game you can find villagers who will trade with you  This teaches kids the value of items,12
67811,1780번,Minecraft,8,Minecraft is just a game that youll keep coming back to over and over again ive played it since 2012 and im still enjoying myself id say 3 because the most violent thing is when things die they fall over into a poof of smoke if your child is younger be careful that they dont go on servers as this could lead to it being potentially innaprorpiate but other then that its amazing the limit is your imagination If you install mods the possibilities increase even more if the device is older it might not be able to handle mods  mods are java edition only  With certain websites you can even make your own servers or if you have friends roudn you can play together on a mini server hosted on your internet only people connected to your internet can join overall its a very very fun game which I highly recommend,3
67812,1780번,Minecraft,8,Minecraft is an amazing sandbox style game that encourages creativity and helps a LOT in learning   Although if your child  is 67 yrs old I suggest NOT to use multiplayer mode  If your child is scared  or may feel uncomfortable with monsters in the game you can change it to peaceful mode  Also in creative mode you have all resources and can build anything This is why Minecraft is excellent for kids 6,5
67813,1780번,Minecraft,8,I will now say my recomendations for parents   When your kid starts playing the game i recommend that it starts to play in creative mode to get a spice of the game  Creative mode lets you build what you want get unlimited items so the player will not have to survive  I also recommend giving them a guide they are online  Let them play creative mode for 1 week  1 month until they become good to the game  When they start playing survival get them a guide  If you not your child will probably start saying How i craft     and WHY A ZOMBIE KILLS ME EVERYTIME every 510 minutes  And whats going to happen is that they will be playing the game for about 1 month AND STILL have made no progress  Why Because to progress in minecraft is hidden  Thats why you need a guide  Your child in 1 month will have crafted 0 items and will die every 5 minutes  The hidden progression that is never explained in the game there is no tutorial is Get wood  Get crafting table  get a sword  get more items,15
67814,1780번,Minecraft,8,You can build anything you like you can do everything it powers imagination I say you should get this for your sondaughter at 6 to 15 yes to 15,2
67815,1780번,Minecraft,8,Personally I think Minecraft is AMAZING   I have been playing it for a week already and I  am addicted to it,3
67816,1780번,Minecraft,8,The game Minecraft is very mild and fun for the whole family  The game costs seven dollars  It is a very fun came but it may cause some friction and frustration  The only violence is  when your character slashes a sword at a pixalated zombie or spider  Minecraft definitly lost its popularity but its still fun  I also completely disagree with its E10 rating  Minecraft is the perfect game for your child definitly consider it for a Hannucha Christmas or Birthday gift,7
67817,1780번,Minecraft,8,I first got this game when I was about 9 years old and I was stunned at how awesome it truly was  It is more of a sandbox game than anything else but it is made well  If you do not have this game already I would recommend that you buy it right now  It endorses imagination as it allows you to build anything youd like In fact in some schools in Sweden it is taught as a mandatory subject in school  This game fosters creativity and is a great way for children to express themselves and build great things  They can even make things like machines with redstone  There is a bit of violence though  you can kill monsters animals and other players but it is not overly graphic or overthetop,7
67818,1780번,Minecraft,8,Obviously you can build anything you want unless your in survivial mode you would have repeat getting more material so you can have   Blocks by being in creative,1
67960,1780번,Minecraft,8,ITS GREAT ITS A LEGEND,1
67961,1780번,Minecraft,8,It is agreat game with a lot of possibilities for what to do but it gets old and boring after awhile  Common sense media over exaggerated about the learning and positive role models,2
67962,1780번,Minecraft,8,Its a fun game  Kids can build and create their own worlds caution if you give this app to your kidsthey will play it for hours  It encourages creativity,3
67963,1780번,Minecraft,8,Addictive and fun,1
67964,1780번,Minecraft,8,This is Quality Buy it People dont buy it cuz it costs 26 95 but it is worth it The Educational value shows kids how to survive the wild dont punch trees with ur hand It also shows you how to be creative The minecraft developers are funny and cool  Easter Eggs are everywhere Same with April fools jokes This is a funny and cool game and i reccomend any Parent buying this The Graphics are awesome News and updates get better and better This is the best game on the market  Also The Community is so friendly No account hackers Not as many bullies as robloxand no online daters This is amazing,15
67965,1780번,Minecraft,8,This game is super simplistic and tons of fun It fosters creativity by allowing kids to build in a sandbox with limitless possibilities  I see a lot of parents here complaining about mods and online interactions  Mods can only be installed through the PC version and take quite a bit of effort  So sex and gun mods shouldnt be an issue  As for online people are jerks  Thats unavoidable,7
67966,1780번,Minecraft,8,not too bad although i mean for those who are christians it has some probably can be called demonic contents and relationship with satandemons and the antichrist How do i know well on youtube and the game you can see some bad things like whatwell if you play at 3am on pocket editionnot sure of other versionsyou will see some demons and the antichrist sign i had it before i and my bro were so into iti told my friends about it they were enchanted whats my well later i deleted it,1
67967,1780번,Minecraft,8,I think the game is safe for 8 year olds  Maybe 7  The game has some violence such as hittingkilling animals or mobs   It teaches you about survival and gathering food out in the wilderness  It also is great for building and planning things  I use it to build and design houses and buildings,6
67968,1780번,Minecraft,8,In multiplayeryou can get bad words in chat  but you can also get positive messages   Everything can happen with modifications   You can also accecedentally say some private informations,3
67969,1780번,Minecraft,8,Its one of my favorite video games and I think its really creative   Im just going to warn people it does have a lot of violence   Its not really a bad kind of violence because youre technically killing to survive   Its good,4
67970,1780번,Minecraft,8,Minecraft is a Mojang created blocky graphics building simulator in which the player survives against hostile mobs hunger and the environment  The violence in this game consists of using weaponry such as pick axes swords Bows axes and other material you find around the world   There is no blood or gore unless one  downloads a mod that imports such content  Minecraft also does not have foul language unless the player is in multiplayer online mode where other players can interact with each other sometimes using foul language  Some of the foul language consists of the words cock dick fuck and ass plus others etc  Players also can make custom skins for themselves which can be revealing showing body parts such as boobs penises and butts  There is also  potion brewing in the game where certain potions can poison you or slow your speed  Also when eating a puffer fish in the game your screen will blur and life will go down simulating a druglike effect  Parents should also be concerned about privacy as people have been hacked  Overall my rating for minecraft would be,10
67971,1780번,Minecraft,8,This game is amazing  There really is no violence aside form killing animals players or hostile mobs but its not graphic  Players can play the game without anyone or anything to kill  This game encourages you to be creative  Minecraft is the type of game that anyone can sit down and enjoy,5
67972,1780번,Minecraft,8,Besides the PC version other versions are boring like Minecraft PE Minecraft W10 etc,1
67973,1780번,Minecraft,8,Maybe you have thought about building an house from scratch   Yet you have no bricks you may have thought another time about surving in the wild    Yet your too scared to take the risk  Ladies and Gentlemen a solution has been found and even better you can achieve anything you want on one single video game     Minecraft is a fun creative and fantastic way to bring out your creative side no matter who you are and what age you maybe Minecraft will bring a smile to your face this one single game gives you the option to create what ever you want from as simple as a brick house or as extravagant as a Iron Spaceship  Not your cup of tea Minecraft offers a survival mode and so from a click of a button your are based  with nothing and are left to fund for your self in the wild  The game is compatible on just about anything from the comfort of your home computer to your portible tablets and mobile phones  Overally I think this game rocks and I recommend it to anyone who is willing to pay Its amazingly cheap price  My hat off to Mojang and the other publishers of this game  FANTASTIC,10
67974,1780번,Minecraft,8,Its fantastic  Creative mode is perfect for building anything from the Empire State Building to a small cottage  Survival is in my opinion slightly more violent as there are monsters  There is a Peaceful mode though so you can always turn them off  In Survival you need to gather your resources by mining and stuff  People from 7 year olds to adults will love the creativity  Parents can play with their kids too  In multiplayer servers players can act badly but the best and most popular servers have a reporting system  I dont think parents should let their kids on Multiplayer until theyre at least 10 though   All in all its stupendous  Play it,11
67975,1780번,Minecraft,8,An open world sandbox game that is randomly generated      The game also features a creative mode where the player is invincible has an unlimited supply of everything can fly and break blocks easily  Welcome to Minecraft A World where you can do anything Google Summary Minecraft offers two worldsSurvival and Creative  In Creative you have no lives build anything discover villages fly and more Survival is a little more tricky you are given 10 hearts and need to collect things for a shelter food and escape monsters who could kill  I would worry a little about safety and privacy because you can interact with other people online  Theres a LOT of consumerism like Tshirts movies books and other things   Yet its very easy to play and I would suggest playing a lot Set a time limit though because its very addicting building things Minecraft is a great game for any video game users,12
67976,1780번,Minecraft,8,It is amazing I can discover new things every day like the nether and end build buildings and go on survival adventures and see how long i can live  Also there are wonderful servers with many enjoyable games  Plus your friends can play with you whether you are playing in a server or in one of your own worlds  I enjoy customizing and looking for new skins that I will wear  SO MUCH FUN,6
67977,1780번,Minecraft,8,Minecraft is a mildly violent video game that inspires kids creativity through building in creative mode  Survival mode allows players to fight monsters and upgrade and craft various items  However there is the ability to play with other players on servers or play on local wifi network games called LAN,3
67978,1780번,Minecraft,8,This game is so fun you can play it on a PC laptop Xbox 360  Mobile Xbox One PS3 PS4 Wii U and Nintendo Switch  no matter what console or other device you own Minecraft is awesome although there tends to be a bit of violence but theres not any blood or gore in it and just a great game in general,2
67979,1780번,Minecraft,8,great game In the game you really have to use your mind  they should have called it mind craft ha ha ha just joking for mums and dads dont really have to know about the game  check with your mum and dad before buying the game,6
68438,1780번,Minecraft,8,AWESOME,1
68439,1780번,Minecraft,8,This game is horrible as itself  The survival is fun at first go to the minecraft wiki for help on crafting recipes but it devolves into mining for hours on end  The creative is good but due to the blocky nature of the game it takes thousands of blocks to create a realistic build that looks good and said build is ginormous so having friends to help is essential  However this is where the game gets fun  You see Notch didnt say you couldnt mess with the game you just cant sell it illegally  The result Thousands hundreds of thousands of mods that CHANGE your game to whatever you want  Adding armor blocks dimensions anything at all You want it theres a mod for it  And if youre the creative kind of guy download WorldEdit helping you build faster using commands  Then theres the multiplayer  Avoid faction servers unless they are really new unless you like dying to people wearing enchanted diamond armor absolute best armor in the game unless you have a mod with better armor  And most people who play on such servers are 6 year olds who think its cool to swear like the devil himself and the game doesnt have a default sensor system   But other servers have plugins multiplayer version of mods that completely change the game to something else  Popular gamemodes are Ghostcraft basically the hidden in minecraft survival games is a classic hungergames Trouble in minevile trouble in terrorist town and minez dayz  The current craze is supercraftbros supersmashbros in minecraft,15
68440,1780번,Minecraft,8,This is the best PC game ever invented The only thing to worry about is some semicreepy monsters that try to hunt you down and kill you  If your child doesnt like long games dont introduce them to it  You must collect lots of materials some of them taking a long time to collect  WARNING To make certain things you must know the combinations to put them in  It is best to know someone who has lots of experience with minecraft,6
68441,1780번,Minecraft,8,This game is great for any child teen or adult  It involves lots of fun learning that can be had  For on e the game is 100 customizable  With using mods and resource packs  You can do anything from changing the way dirt looks to getting a pet cat and naming it nemo You can also change the way you look with minecraft novaskin me and many other fun and exciting things  Although a visit to youtube with be needed to help  Id suggest looking at TheDiamondMinecart for help,8
68442,1780번,Minecraft,8,This game is the one that got me into gaming Its a sandbox and open world game and there is a very loose story in the form of going to the nether and then the end  Its all about exploring and finding the items needed to survive  There is a massive community and a lot of public servers but be carefull as some server are cracked and can take your password and username  Trolls and griefers are also a problem on public servers there are however nice servers out there and most servers will ban griefers  Also a nother thing is its addticting nature of the game as I am at school for 89 hours a day and during term time I never had time for minecraft but during the hoildays that would shoot up to 89 hours ON minecraft a day I have gotten over it now but I would tell parnets to watch their childs play time on minecraft  There is also a massive modding community and a look though some of the mods is a good idea  Over all its a great game and is worth every penny,8
68443,1780번,Minecraft,8,When everyone is says NOT FOR KIDS probably millions of kids from 4at least 50 I personally love the game it is a game of blocks where you can,1
68444,1780번,Minecraft,8,awesome game better than roblox it doesnt have sex profanity etc,1
68445,1780번,Minecraft,8,Haha This is fun,2
68446,1780번,Minecraft,8,get mine craft its worth every penny GET IT,2
68447,1780번,Minecraft,8,I like to play Minecraft whenever I have the time to  You can craft and mine and do lots of other things  And you could learn stuff from it to  You can learn to craft and smelt things like how i learnt that glass is made from sand  You also explore caves and kill zombies and other creatures  And there is no blood  But Its so addicting that there is 16000000 and more players,7
68741,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,I loved this movie but it is definitely a PreTeen movie,1
68742,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,I didnt really like this movie  I mean the love story was cute and everything but the plot seems very plain and simple  Al least to me  Fine for kids there is  nothing confusing about the plot  Its very simple  One thing I found annoying was the dialogue for some reason it seemed very very cheesy to me,7
68743,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,It is a great movie although it has a little bit of violence in it  That is the only reason i chose 8 and up,2
68744,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,i tried to watch this movie and couldnt even sit though it all  its so cliche that its disturbing,2
68745,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,Contins some fantasy action and mild rude humor,1
68746,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,This film sends out an importanat message that judging someone by their appearence is not OK and that greed and beeing vain wont get you very far in life,1
68747,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,I love this film Its great that snow white gets to be the fighter for once Snow white is really pretty  ,4
68748,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,It wasnt very good I was definitely dissappointed  It was boring for older kids and adults yet contained lots of dirty humor that was not appropriate for younger ages  Not even worth a dollar at Redbox,3
68749,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,in one point the prince pounces on the queen and licks her facealso the dwarfs will start trying to kill each other with weapons drunk  the 5 year old i was babysitting seemed to like it  this is a very good movie at the end the prince and snow white seal there love with a kiss good for kids 5 and up probaly,3
68750,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,I think it was a little violent but Im a girl and 10 and to me it was fine  I reccomend being 9 to watch  Just because it might be hard to understand,3
68827,1788번,Misery,8,I think Misery was a great movie but there is too much profanity  LANGUAGE There are several uses of St  one use of Fk and words like dirty bird from Annie  Paul writes fk in a type writer about 6 times  Paul also flips Annie the bird once   DRINKING DRUGS AND SMOKING Annie consistently drugs Paul and there is several scenes with smoking  Wine is drank in 1 scene  VIOLENCE There is a lot of violence in this film  The movie starts out with a car crash  At the end there is a pretty brutal fight scene they are hitting each other with anvil type things The movie is pretty creepy overall  Annie shows up standing up by his bed when he is sleeping  She breaks both of his ankles  Overall this movie is great and I think a mature 1112 year old can handle it,13
68828,1788번,Misery,8,I watched this movie a while ago and I did find it to be a little disturbing and pretty dang unsettling but it wasnt that bad  There was some language as well like a middle finger and one spoken f word and c sucker is said once as well  The sledgehammer scene was also very disturbing and had unsettling music in the background but I say that 13 and up can see this movie and maybe a mature 12 year old,3
68829,1788번,Misery,8,Sex 210,1
68830,1788번,Misery,8,It was very well written a chilling movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat but be warned this movie WILL give you nightmares,1
68831,1788번,Misery,8,This movie is definatly not appropriate for any children under 15 or 14  It is not as much scary as violent  Paul Sheldon as the bones in his feet broken and one of them is onscreen he screams and the ending fight is very violent  Their is also some language and 1 finger but like I said this is not for kids  Reviews on here say its okay for 10 year olds  Definatly not  As far as how good the movie itself is it is good but not as good as the book which kids shouldnt read eathir but Kathy Bates preforms her role very well and plays Annie Wilkes great,7
68832,1788번,Misery,8,I watched this movie when i was 11 and i was fine but i was also watching slashers at that age,1
68833,1788번,Misery,8,Brief strong violence with some swearing  Nowhere near as violent and profanity filled as most of his other movies  This is an amazing movie thats good for kids 12 and up or younger if violence doesnt disturb them and they dont repeat some of the words because this is one many Stephen King movies that isnt scary,3
68834,1788번,Misery,8,This movie was fine but not my favorite  It had some language but it was pretty mild R with only a few F words  The movie does have a few scenes of violence mostly towards the end but there is one scene in the middle that is extremely tough to watch and not for the squeamish  In this scene a woman puts a wooden block in between his legs next to his ankles and breaks them with a sledge hammer and this is the most hard to watch scene  This whole movie is very intense and scary but I think a mature ten cold handle it if they dont see the ankle scene,5
68835,1788번,Misery,8,I watched this movie last night and Im 9 some parts are violent but its suitable for 9 and up  The hammer scene was a bit graphic though,2
68905,1794번,Miss Persona,5,Miss Persona is so funny She dresses up as all sorts of fun people And she also helps her friends by dressing up Its a really cool tv show to sum it up,4
69010,1803번,Moana,5,Moana is an excellent movie There are strong positive role models and even the negative ones I mean Maui become good role models and make up for their mistakes towards the end  This movie has some scares but kids ages 6 or 7 and up should be able to handle it  There is some potty language typical for kids movies but it doesnt go beyond appropriate  The music here is also wonderful  This is a great movie for kids and I recommend watching it,6
69011,1803번,Moana,5,To much singing if you hate it when ur kids sing the song for ages the dont watch if not then 10 out of 10 would lemur again,1
69012,1803번,Moana,5,I loved Moana  It is very beautiful and entertaining  I recommend for ages 6 and older because some scenes can be potentially frightening for younger viewers  However it is very wonderful,4
69013,1803번,Moana,5,I put 4 and up because there really isnt a reason a four year old shouldnt watch this  Honestly I think even if you have a kid that is three or younger itd be fine  I just wasnt sure because there is a part with kind of like a lava fire monster lady thing  She didnt come off as too scary to me although I am 15 so I have no idea how your 2 year old would react to someone throwing fireballs and being made out of lava and rock  Other than that the movie is great Moana is such a wholesome Disney princess Shes got a great attitude and for once I love where the storyline isnt about finding a prince  Great movie and the songs are beautiful  Oh also I wouldnt show your kids this no matter their age if someone in the family just passed  In this movie Moanas grandmother dies sorry spoiler and it is sad  Moanas grandmother dies peacefully though,11
69014,1803번,Moana,5,Moana is a movie about a young woman who ventures outside of her island in order to restore the heart to a goddess  It has great messages because it shows how you sometimes have to have courage to do what is right even if everybody else is doing wrong  The great role models are Moana and Maui  Moana is a couragous and brave leader who goes on a daring quest to restore peace  Maui helps Moana along her quest even though he is the one that caused everything to be destroyed in the first place  It has some violence and some creatures and monsters that could be frightening for young kids  There is a lava monster who eventually turns into the goddess as well as a giant crab and coconut pirates with weapons  There are some thunderstorms and lightening that happen while Moana is out on the ocean which could also be scary  It is worth noting that while Moana is a kidfriendly movie most of the female characters wear skirts and a bikini top and all of the males wear just skirts  The women who arent wearing skirts and bikini tops are wearing revealing dresses so you might want to consider that  Some mild language is used but nothing that would be extremely inappropraite for a tenyearold as long as they know not to repeat it  There are a few scenes where Maui tells Moana that she is going to get killed and one where he says that the entrance to the crabs palace wont appear unless he makes a human sacrafice  Moana also says inappropriate things throughout the movie some nearswearwords but no actual swear words  Moanas grandmother dies in the beginning of the movie though it is not shown onscreen  It is also shown how Moanas fathers friend drowned in the ocean when he was a young man  There is also a scene at the beginning of the movie that shows a man being forced to get a painful tattoo  Another thing is that all of the adult characters have tattoos and I wasnt a huge fan of how it promoted tattoos especially in that first scene  Maui also goes to the bathroom in the water and leaves Moana to feel the water afterwards and that part was very gross  If there wasnt as much violence or innappropriate content I would reccommend this movie for ages six and up  No consumerism or innappropriate substances are present  Overall Moana is a great animated movie and is one of my favorite animated movies of all time  but I would highly reccommend it for ages ten and older only  It was marketed as a kidfriendly movie but I see it as a movie more for tweens and older kids,22
69015,1803번,Moana,5,Good  Some funny parts like the dart put in Mauis pottyprivate part  And positive models  You have to see this  You might even give it 5 stars Really good movie  Id probably rate it 5,7
69016,1803번,Moana,5,Well it is good but I saw a bit of disqusting things but it was only one,1
69017,1803번,Moana,5,He was heralded as the first and only WWE member and it turned out he was actually a Hawaiian demigod  His name was Maui and he got his powers from a magic hook  He gave humans many gifts and decided to steal life magic from the island lady  It turns out that was a bad idea and he was attacked by the lava guy  Oops  But then he meets Moan who is a princess from a village and shes like give the life thing back to the island lady  So Mauis like No but then hes like ok so its gucci  But Maui doesnt have the life thingy so they have to get it from a shiny crab man named Tomato  They almost die but then Moan gets the life thingy  Oh yeah theres also an immortal chicken  Then they  go to fight the lava guy but Mauis hook gets broke  Then Maui is like Im sad  Moan is like I am Moan  Then she goes to fight the lava guy again  Oh and the ocean is sentient so anyway she goes to fight the lava guy again  Maui comes back and helps DONT READ AHEAD IF U DONT WANT SPOILERS Then ooo plot twist the lava guy is the island girl but without the life thingy  The the island girl gives maui a new hook cuz he broke his  Moans village gets saved and they become seatravelers again  The end  Or is it  Moan 2 coming to theaters in 1995,22
69018,1803번,Moana,5,I liked this film because of the courage this film shows  The music was good in the film and it is very entertaining but the movie is kind of violent so I think it is ok for People 8 and up,2
69019,1803번,Moana,5,Moana is great   I liked the singing   There are some parts that are scary  Its a funny movie because of Hehe and Pua theyre so great,4
69078,1803번,Moana,8,Took the 3yo goddaughter to see this today at PimmiPlayHouse a place that plays movies that have already left the theater  She was alarmed by the sea crab and asked to leave  I had already seen the movie and obliged to leave because she was crying   I think she was just too young for it  Maybe in a couple of years well try this movie again,5
69079,1803번,Moana,8,Moana is really good for any children wanting an adventurous movie with a female main character  There are lots of great songs and I really think Moana and Maui are good role models for little children  They dont give up or at least they come back to face the problem  It was a little scary foy my younger brother but otherwise it is great in every way,4
69080,1803번,Moana,8,I thought that it was very predictable but over all it was pretty sweet,1
69081,1803번,Moana,8,the movie is ok but on here you cant watch it,1
69082,1803번,Moana,8,Moana is an awesome movie Moana Maui and other characters show role models that other people should follow  Also children can get a feel for ancient Polynesian culture  Other than that the movie is curious thrilling and just hilarious,4
69083,1803번,Moana,8,your kids will drown in boredom  Oh ya ps the star actor is World Wrestling Championthe rock,2
69084,1803번,Moana,8,This is a Disney movie that is filled with bravery   A young girl named Moana sets off on a boat to save her island    She meets a demigod named Maui and they journey and they meet a craband a huge lava monster   They are fun catchy songs that are appropriate for kids   The language is not bad at all but they are some violent scenes Hope this review was good,5
69085,1803번,Moana,8,so good great for families,2
69086,1803번,Moana,8,Great animation film about a heroic girl who seeks for adventure  Its perfect for kids and families  has great music and good visual  Has some scary moments but nothing too intense   Its one of the best animation films of the year and its nominated for two Oscars,4

69963,1822번,"Monsters, Inc.",5,Before reading Id like you to know that I tried not to put any spoilers in my review  Happy reading I recently watched this movie for the first time  I didnt think Id like it as much as I did  The visuals are pretty good  Everything looks pretty realistic  I think it was kind of funny  The monsters may scare young children  There were some insults though  There are some great messages families can have talks about  Same with the great rolemodels  I hope you see this movie and thank you for reading,12

70704,1858번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,I was traumatized when I first saw it and it still creeps me out for some reason,1
70705,1858번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,Its a very funny movie that does not need to be rated PG13  I watched it when I was 10 and my sister who is 9 saw it at 8  It has a good message and good acting  There are some swear words and a few mildly inappropriate references but its not that bad and it will easily go over younger peoples head  Its very funny and I recommender for families,5
70706,1858번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,This is a great movie for everyone to watch whether or not they have gone through a divorce because it is absolutely hilarious and lets the kids know that even if the parents dont love each other anymore they still love them  I say 10 for language some sexual jokes and brief arguingyelling,2
70707,1858번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,This film is really good Im being honest its my 3rd favorite movie behind Schindlers List and Jurassic Park  But just like with those other two films Mrs  Doubtfire is one of the greatest films of 1993 and it does a good job on setting you up in an emotional place  For example there are some times throughout the film where you are probably laughing so hard where you cant breath or some times where you cry feeling emotional due to how the characters feel  Because the plot of the story is emotional which shows a couple being divorced and the dad disguises himself thanks to his brother and its actually a good idea for a comedydrama film  However I can not let this movie go without adding some critique to it OK so lets start with the fact that there is a few sexual references throughout the movie but thats why its got the PG13 rating and a majority of them will probably go over kids heads  Also for a Robin Williams comedy there is a lot of language the website says that there was an F word in the film but I watched the movie twice and I did not hear any F bombs in it  This is a very good movie its understandable of making 2nd place at the box office during the time it was released and this is a good movie for 11 but anyone under than that should definitely have a parent or guardian with them,7
70708,1858번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,This movie is hilarious  I couldnt stop laughing  The father of 3 kids dresses up as a nanny to be with his kids  He faces many obstacles that are very funny to watch  A Great  family pick for some good laughs,5
70709,1858번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,Every kid of every age will find this movie funny though kids of 11 will probably get the jokes  it is a delightful look at what happens when a divorced father pretends to be a prim English nurse  Some inexplicably vulgar sexual content when he overtly quizzes the mother on her sex life and warns Stu Pierce Brosnan about some of her sex life  Occasional sex jokes but mostly a family movie  Robin Williams is cute and very good at imitations Harvey Fierstein is consistently entertaining and Sally Field provides a relieving gravitas  Definitely recommended,6
70710,1858번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,Great movie for families very very very funny  I highly recommend it,2
70711,1858번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,I remember when i first watched this movie didnt really understand it but i watched it again a few years later and loved it,1
70712,1858번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,This movie was hallarious but did have words such as motherf  kers  tassand much more,1
70847,1864번,Mulan (2020),8,Why do I say this Well to begin the acting is truly amazing the battle scenes are epic and the movie has an overall pretty cool vibe to it,2
70848,1864번,Mulan (2020),8,I am  a girl and 12  I think that this movie is not as violent as it might seem  When I first read all the comments and reviews I was worried if it was appropriate for me but when I watched the movie I found that it wasnt that scary at all  There isnt any inappropriate scenes for younger viewers  It is very entertaining and inspiring  A great movie for 9 up,6
70849,1864번,Mulan (2020),8,I thought it was good Most people are stewing about the bathing scene but it was shown in a clever and nonsexual way and I thought it wasnt much of an issue  Barely any profanities and not much violence  It showed female strength and that was one of the best parts I would totally recommend,5
70850,1864번,Mulan (2020),8,I really dont know why everyone says this isnt a great movie  I watched it right when it came out and it was way better than I expected  There isnt much violence and the characters are really well played  If you are thinking of watching this I highly recommend it,4
70851,1864번,Mulan (2020),8,Honestly the nudity was probably worse than the violence but just so you know this is the violence 1 The worst violence scene is the final fight scene SPOILER SPOILER,1
70852,1864번,Mulan (2020),8,Its a fine movie but it subtracts one of the main charectors Mushu,1
70853,1864번,Mulan (2020),8,The movie was Very good   I think that kids can watch this because shes only throwing them around there is no blood even when she stabs them no blood on the sword Positive role model for girls  The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is they took the dragon out He was funny,4
70854,1864번,Mulan (2020),8,Mulan 2020 is really not as bad people say  I really enjoyed watching this movie as it was exciting  I would say for kids 11 up because there was quite a bit of violence which could scare younger children  I would recommend,4
70855,1864번,Mulan (2020),8,I loved this movie so much and I think its a great message for kids about womans strength and power  It was very attention grabbing and I honestly dont understand why so many people dislike this movie  Well yes there is a few pieces of the cartoon movie that arent in the live action but I reckon it makes it better because its more realistic and there is a whole new character in this movie that gets rid of the dissapointment that mushu doesnt show up  Thanks for reading my review if you have gotten this far I 100 reccomend,4
70939,1865번,Mulan,6,My favourite film of all time been watching it since I was 5 years old,1
70940,1865번,Mulan,6,This movie is wayyyyyy better then the remake watch this one instead,1
70941,1865번,Mulan,6,Honestly this movie is just amazing all around  Great messages for kids great characters actual drama and emotion and great music  It does get a bit dark at points but doesnt have anything too graphic,3
70942,1865번,Mulan,6,The only thing I would object to in this film is the nudity when Mulan is bathing but the men come there too  Otherwise a great film with great role models,2
70943,1865번,Mulan,6,Mulan is one of my favorite movies  It shows a strong independent woman who helps fight for her country  I think its great for 5 because it has a happy ending and I personally dont think the fight scenes are very intense  AWESOME MOVIE GO WATCH IT,5
70944,1865번,Mulan,6,Its a great Disney movie but its story is misleading as like Pocahontas before it it suffers from being very inaccurate  But I dont blame Disney for sugar coating this movie as the real Mulan committed suicide after her service because she was going to be made a concubine  I will say that other than being watered down into a fantasy adventure film is really good and there is comic relief  Thats a story about Asian people  Mulan is a one of the great role models for children and she is worth for fighting for  She doesnt want her father to go to war like a military and she becomes strong  She takes her fathers place  Also a 16 year old girl like other Disney Princesses such as Aurora Moana Ariel and Merida  Mulan is the first place most good Disney Princess  Though it has war violence like theres too many Hun army to destroy Shangs in the mountains  We have 2000 Huns 4000 of them in real life  I dont know why there is so many Hun soldiers who want to take over China  There is a village called Tung Shao Pass that was destroyed by the Huns  There is high body count you can see dead soldiers and horses especially the poor little girl who lost her Lilo doll  A main antagonist ShanYu invades Chinese castle and he passed away in the fireworks bomb  ShanYu is one of the underrated Disney Villains but Mulans a Disney masterpiece  Some people are not allowed to coloring their scleras because its really painful for your eyes  ShanYu has black ink on his eyes that makes him scary and looks like hes having a night vision  I forgot that he has sith eyes  I have sensitive eyes but I couldnt stop thinking about him when I was 9 and I wish I had to change my eye color with powers  Im so obsessed with Mulan at the age of 9 and I really want to try to watch it  Okay also worth noting that theres some sexual jokes in the movie and a very akward skinny dippingbathing scene in which you see Yao standing up on a rock in front of Mulan  The viewer doesnt see anything but its implied that Mulan did as she tells Mushu that she never wants to see a naked guy ever again at which point a bunch of nude men run past  Has plenty of jokes that might go over the kids heads but will keep grown ups laughing  Even LiShangs back is shown and Mulan gets stunned  LiShang looks so hot though  Lets get down to business to defeat the Huns is going to be acronym for LGBT and some theorists think that Shang is gay or Bisexual  It has funny scenes like the Matchmakers butt becomes fire fart Mushu is being Batman and some scenes are funny  I have an only problem that Mulan is having a big ears and thats too funny for the Disney Princess films  There is also ShanYu is thicc I bet that he may be thicc as Thanos you Mulan fans may find it funny  I couldnt stop laughing Some fans may complain that ShanYu being attractive I dont think so So anyways The Animation is great and stunning great characters and amazing plot  Thats a historical inaccurate but the Disney movie made the original legend even better I recommend for ages 5 or 6  Great job Disney Though I will be 15 to see a release date of live action Mulan it has different characters different plot and it will release Aug 21 2020  Maybe fans of animated Mulan will might be disappointed,40
70945,1865번,Mulan,6,So I LOVEEE this movie but there is a LOTTA  VIOLENCE,1

71056,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,Really Good  Not Much to Say  No Content  Does have positve messages and role models though,4
71057,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,Its such a good Muppet movie as they all are  One of the best,2
71058,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,This sequel is certainly more intense and has a lot more action and suggestive moments then the first  Kids should be older and it will not appeal to crowds older then 13,2
71059,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,For longtime Muppet fans this movie will entertain and excite  For younger children they may be frightened by some scenes but the action is more entertaining than straightup horrorstyle,2
71060,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,It is super good but there are some loud scenes where they are breaking in  and it is a really good movie,1
71061,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,I watched this when it came out a long time ago and it was SUPER scary  I think I can handle it now though ,2
71062,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,This is the worst movie I have seen in ages  Way to scary for muppet loving kids  The person who came up with the idea of this Horror yes I said it  Horror  movie is nuts  Mad,6
71063,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,This is what you get if you mixed who framed roger rabbit with the great muppet caper  Oh its too dark did you read the plot before seeing this movie  My then 3 year old cousin now 5 saw this with me on opening day and she actually enjoyed it  This movie delivers a message about honesty Kermit tries to tell the truth that hes not Constantine,4
71064,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,My ratingPG for violence,1
71065,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Mild violence,1
71066,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,This Muppet sequel doesnt reach its high standards as the 2011 film but it is great just the way it is  This movie brings a lot of heart and gags that I am sure are capable of entertaining people of all ages  This movie is good for all ages even little ones,3
71067,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Hilarious Perfect for all kids but some may not understand all the jokes  The reason I didnt give it a higher rating was because I almost fell asleep during the film,3
71068,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,i wanted to see this movie when it came out  i liked the first one a little better,2
71069,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,While not without its flaws this muppet film is a great one with a nice caper plot and some great writting  Though some of the characters are off with Fozzie being dumb the gang not recognizing the difference between a frog and their friend of four decades and a in your face moral followindg the climax it still manages to hold up with some great songs a really good plot and the pairing of Sam the Eagle and Ty Burrell is one of the films strong points  For kids there are some violent scenes including explosions and bombs that might scare them and not much else that would be inappropriate for kids  Overal great film and an improvement on its more human focused predecessor,4
71070,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,My mother took me and my two younger brothers 10 and 8 despite my refusals  The advertisements seemed to bore me and really didnt grab my attention  It wasnt worth the eight dollars per ticket  I understood the humor but I still didnt like the movie  Maybe it is just me but talking muppets really dont grab the attention of an adolescent,5
71071,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,This movie is not as great as the first and money wasting,1
71072,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Not as good as The Muppets which I really adore but still worth watching  It has some funny scenes  The cameo appearances was a surprise  Ricky Gervais was good Tina Fey was funny but for me Ty Burrell stole the show with Sam The Eagle  They were hilarious  At least the songs were catchy,6
71073,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Truly I thought it was good   It has a lesson in it dont judge a book by its cover because Kermit was taken to jail because he looked like the bad frog in the movie also there were great messages in the movie but only a few bad words like butt stupid ect   So truly in think you and your family should watch this movie together   Its great for family movie night,4
71074,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Do you like unpredictable movies Do you like movie that makes  you jump If so you would  love the muppets most wanted  I rate it 4 stars it is good for 6 year olds and up There is some parts in the movie that makes you jump If you are looking for a quiet movie this is not right movie to go to  There is lot of famous characters like for  example Ross Lynch from Austin and Ally and a ton more that you might know   It is a pg movie once again I rate it 4 stars out of 5 star,8
71481,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,I LOVED this movie when I was little and I still do  Its great for young and sensitive kids because the violence is minimal and most of the story revolves around the Totoro and his friends,2
71482,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This is an adorable movie that me and my younger sister loved Totoro is super nice he tries to cheer up the girls when their mom doesnt come home from the hospital and he stands with them in the rain while the girls wait for their dad to come home  Satski goes looking everywhere for her sister showing positive roll models and good messages  There are some little ghost things called soot sprites which maybe be sort of creepy for kids under the age of 3  But otherwise I loved it Didnt know Dakota Fanning was in it either,7
71483,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Despite the popularity of the movie I didnt find it very good  The plot wasnt super interesting but I find its more for younger viewers,2
71484,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Was a bit bored for the first 20 minutes but I ended up really enjoying it,1
71485,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,its awsome but people always say the bath scene inappropriate should not be in movie NO LIKE SHUT UR MOUTH PEOPLE back then people did not have a hot water so they had to heat it up and that took long and was a lot of work thats why,2
71486,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Every time I see chubby bunny rat it scares me  Especially on the cover the way its eyes are opened wide and its half way in the shade And the MOUTH AHHH so scary would CERTAINLY freak out little kids,4
71487,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is a Japanese film for kids and doesnt contain anything bad,1
71488,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,I and all my family LOVE this movie It is great I think its awesome because it has a great positive message and it shows two girls that are sisters that moved to a different place and only with their dad because Their mom is in the hospital  It doesnt show anything scary about the mom being in the hospital because shes just a little sick  Though I do think parents should know is that theres one part where the older sister is afraid her mom will get really sick and something will happen to her and shell die but its appropriate and not scary at all even for little kids,5
71489,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,I feel that this movie is a whimsical introduction to Studio Ghibli along with Kikis Delivery Service and The Cat Returns  It tells a heartwarming story and the main characters are beyond relatable to a pair of siblings  However there is the plot point of Satsuki and Meis mother Yasuko  In the movie Yasuko has tuberculosis and when her condition becomes more critical Mei runs away from home  Some say this scene is a gives the movie a deceptive twist that scared their children and ruined the movie  You know what else is deceptive Tuberculosis terminal illness  You need to explain what is going on if your child asks and ask them if they understand  If you keep this information from them theyll learn further in the future and it would be much more traumatic  You shouldnt lie to your kids because if they wholly believe your lies youll come off as untrustworthy to your kids and it would mess them up further later  So teach your kid whats going on if they need to know  Itll work better eventually  Knowledge is power,13
71490,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,its very very very verygreat its the best movie ever,1
71527,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Very good movie for babies kids tweens teens and adults,1
71528,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Well Spirited Away it looks like youre finally off the hook I have now seen seven Hayao Miyazaki movies with widely varying degrees of enjoyment  Princess Mononoke and Porco Rosso are legitimately fantastic films animation or otherwise  Castle in the Sky is a largely enjoyable movie bogged down with a weak 3rd act and a bloated runtime  Nausica of the Valley of the Wind and Howls Moving Castle both had interesting parts but were ultimately too scattershot and tedious to be fully enjoyable  And Spirited Away was easily the most overrated and unsatisfying of the whole bunch     until I saw My Neighbor Totoro,6
71529,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This used to be my favroute movie when I was little now I still love it many of the characters are kind and warmhearted,1
71530,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This film is most defiantly one of Miyazakis best productions  A great famliy movie experience  Good for all audiences  Spectacular artwork  A beautiful film   Mostly recommended for younger kids  A must for Young anime fans,7
71531,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,I absolutely love this movie  Its a cute story with a deep meaning behind it  Once I figured out the meaning it kind of freaked me out  Still it was an amazing movie with imaginative characters and beautiful animation  Spoiler It had me thinking that the mother was about to die and I was close to crying through it thinking of what would happen if she died in the movie  It was so sad how Mei was  bringing the corn all the way just to give it to her mother  Overall its a really good movie and you should see it,7
71532,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This Movie is The 5th Miyazaki Film I Have Watched Out of 9 It Was Such a Cute Movie With an Amazing Story and Plot  With Breathtaking Animation I Think My Neighbor Totoro should be in the Top 5 Best Movies Ever Made,2
71533,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Great movie,2
71534,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This a amazing film for everyone Its funny in parts and really enjoyable  Its very creative and almost like a dream the artdrawing is very good too,3

71580,1891번,My Octopus Teacher,8,Beautiful docu  Thats all I can say,2
71581,1891번,My Octopus Teacher,8,Gorgeous film Really inspirational  I usually dont like documentaries Except for the Taylor Swift one of course but this one is amazing,3
71582,1891번,My Octopus Teacher,8,This is an emotional entertaining documentary about a man going through depression who visits an octopus every day and eventually befriends it  Some kids wont find it interesting enough to keep watching but older kids will likely be drawn in  Theres almost nothing wrong with this movie except the depression aspect might confuse some younger kids  Watch it,4
71583,1891번,My Octopus Teacher,8,i think the movie comes out special but for someone the movie can be boaring it got one sad part but the rest is him telling about the octopus he have seen  the movie is special and i do recommend it  wow    i learned alot,3
71584,1891번,My Octopus Teacher,8,I loved this movie It was fun and more of a documentary but overall really good  My whole family loved it and its usually very hard for us to figure out what to watch,3
71585,1891번,My Octopus Teacher,8,My octopus teacher  What a life  I mean you always hear Long live the king  But have you heard Long live the octopus Have you Ok I didnt mean to threaten you  Oh yes I did im sorry not really   Im actually very nice you know    can I break your Ps4 Sooo    I regard this movie more like a documentary  It is pretty tear jerking at most times  It looks like a 1 hour long ad but like one of the BEST ads ever you know  If your going watch this your going to want to become an  scuba diver  For real  Enjoy  Its sad  And sad  And sadder  Enjoy again  No really  What are you reading  I said go  Enjoy  Oh wait  I need to,24
71586,1891번,My Octopus Teacher,8,Great movie  For kids interested in underwater life about forests under the water learning about octopuses and how they live their life under the sea  This movie also shows about how octopuses protect themselves from enemies and has zero violence except for one sad part in the movie With sharks But aside from that the movie is really fun and really interesting and will not give any kids nightmares,3
71587,1891번,My Octopus Teacher,8,Heartfelt though you have to be pretty rich to literally do nothing but visit an octopus for a year and a half  He has a nice house on the beach front etc  Very good docco for kids,3
71588,1891번,My Octopus Teacher,8,My Octopus Teacher is a really coolamazing movie but it gets really scarysad at the end my favorite part is where the octopus got on him   My mom cried  But instead of crying I was laughing inside myself while she was crying  But overall it is a pretty good movie  It was really sweet but also stressful especially at the end like when there was a shark chasing the octopus   But watch it if you can,6
71602,1893번,My Spy,7,Theres a lot of violence just heads up theres kicking punching stabbing exploding killing throwing fire heads getting chopped off  Violence 1010 language 810 theres ss btch st dk gruesome things 610 a little gross from vomiting and blood and some mean and good messages but thats all,2
71603,1893번,My Spy,7,I loved the movie a lot Even though there were swearing  in the movie it didnt bother me  My parents let me watch this movie With them  Still its the best spy movie Ive ever seen  So Id say give the movie a shot There is violence though like punching and kicking and pushing a truck down a big clif,6
71604,1893번,My Spy,7,It was great  A couple iffy things though including how JJ threatens to kill a nine year old and said nine year old is manipulative and curses plus the overall language and violence gosh I make it sound bad but I really liked it   I feel though that if they toned it down a notch it could have been PG but oh well,3
71605,1893번,My Spy,7,Parents are overreacting about this movie  This is a spy movie and any movie that involves the government and spies and a big burly man in a serious way is not an ok way to spent your kids time  If a parent watches the trailer checks the common sense review and still thinks Oh a man gets decapitated and a kid calls an adult a dk Well Im going to 100 show that to my 9yearold Then thats just bad parenting  I get it if some parents didnt check how old you need to be to watch this movie but if you actually took the time afterward to write a review on this site and KNEW ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND then dont blame the movie for being aimed at tweens blame yourself for not reading about this movie before you show it to your kids  Again Im not blaming parents who didnt get a good opinion but really man be more careful  Im not gonna do an I hope this review helped Thing I normally do because I am writing this review at 1030 at night and I am very tired  So goodnight commonsense See ya tomorrow,9
71606,1893번,My Spy,7,This was a really fun movie  Based on the ratings I was a little worried but it was pretty good  The language wasnt the best but most mature children will be able to handle it  There is a gay couple so make sure that your kids understand that  Overall good movie,5
71607,1893번,My Spy,7,It has violence but not that that much I watched it with a friend and her younger brother it has some language but its pretty appropriate if you dont like violence dont watch it,1
71608,1893번,My Spy,7,This Movie is honestly a great one I loved seeing a big guy like Drax teaming up with a Little girl  They have shanking stabbing shooting punching and other violence but if your 1011 that wont bother you too much  There is too much swearing for a movie supposedly for 10 year olds  There is uses of Bith Sht Jesus and more but if you watch Action movies it wont be such a big deal If your 10 in my opinion it would be fine,4
71609,1893번,My Spy,7,A lot of bad language and a lot of bad fist fights that might scare your younger kids  Also some kissy stuff and flirting and gross stuff like that  Overall there are some good messages like team work and family  There are some scary weapons plus a main character throws a knife at another character and barfs on accident  Although the action might be scary it is actually super sick  Very funny Great movie,7
71996,1911번,Need for Speed,8,Not bad but pretty predictable and kinda corny at times  Aaron Pauls performance is great but overall its not the best action film out there,2
71997,1911번,Need for Speed,8,Aaron Paul is brilliant in this it was good seeing him not cooking meth with a 50 year old man lmao the movie is a fun pretty good movie I like how there is no CGI used which is great And what CSM forgot to put under positive messages is SPOILERS the bad guy manslaughters his friend and leaves him there and at the end a similar situation happens at the end with the bad guy in the car and Toby Aaron Paul takes him out of the car to make sure hes alright,3
71998,1911번,Need for Speed,8,Need for Speed the movie has to be one of the better gamebased movies out there  It has charming characters intense but mostly grounded action and some pretty great moments,2
71999,1911번,Need for Speed,8,This movie is fine for younger teens,1
72000,1911번,Need for Speed,8,It was a really good movie  Very good story the racing was amazing,2
72001,1911번,Need for Speed,8,Good car movie,1
72002,1911번,Need for Speed,8,I think this movie is recommended for a 12 but the nudity is not bad just a butt shown only,1
72003,1911번,Need for Speed,8,My ratingPG13 for intense sequences of crashes and actionsome languageracy contentand brief nudity,1
72013,1912번,Never Been Kissed,8,This movie was fantastic I loved the plot it was invigorating and engaging  Movie does include a scene that takes place in a sexed classroom diagrams are present as well as the classic bananacondom learning activity  I recommend this movie to kids 13 and older due to that one scene as well as a few sexual comments throughout the movie  Any kids younger should either watch with a parent or not watch at all but the movie has got great lessons and can teach kids some good values  There is also some mild drug taking pot brownie but its nothing serious shouldnt be a problem  Also do be aware that there is some flirtation between a teacher and an undercover student the student is actually 25 but pretending to be 17  Id make sure your child is aware that studentteacher relationships are definitely not okay because while this is a great movie its from the 90s so its a bit more lack on that kind of thing than we are today  Overall Id definitely recommend it just know your child and be ready to explain whats okay and whats not,9
72014,1912번,Never Been Kissed,8,Overall this movie didnt wow me  I definitely didnt hate it but it didnt really pack the punch i was hoping for  One of the most problematic themes is the flirting between the teacher and a perceived student  Although the student is actually an adult my mom and I were still very concerned by this,4
72015,1912번,Never Been Kissed,8,This movie was very entertaining but it has a lot of sex references  Definitely 13 or 12 with a parent,2
72016,1912번,Never Been Kissed,8,It a good movie but  there is some drinking  and sx in the movie  I think kids who are under 13 years old should watch it with a parent,3
72017,1912번,Never Been Kissed,8,This movie has a great lesson and theme and is very good  The only thing some parents might have to worry about is a few uses of drugs and two people making out,2
72018,1912번,Never Been Kissed,8,The main character goes undercover as a high school student and she and a teacher clearly both are attracted to each other even though he believes shes a student  When she announces that she is actually an adult the teacher seems really conflicted and upset  But he was fine with it when he thought she was a minor Gross,4
72019,1912번,Never Been Kissed,8,I have to say this is one of my all time favorite rom coms  Some scenes could be a lil iffy for younger viewers like when they put condoms on bananas etc  Language is mild   couple of shts once in a while  Also Micheal Varton is effing hot ,5
72020,1912번,Never Been Kissed,8,this movie was both funnyboringinappropriate and just your normal romcom     I liked it and agree that it is a must see but    i dunno     if you are looking for a really great romcom watch Love actually soooooo much better It wasnt as inappropriate as I thought it would be unlike four weddings and a funeral but it is still a bit racy   Id say watch it before you let your kids see it then decide what you think,3
72021,1912번,Never Been Kissed,8,My ratingR for mature racy content throughoutgraphic nuditydrug useand language,1

72224,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,Nobody,1
72225,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,Its a funny film with a few stereotypes about  Sacajawea and Attila the Hun also some mild peril and Larry is chased by Attila the Hun with swords two little guys crash a car into a rock and they presumably died  Also some language like kick ass hell and dum dum,2
72226,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,Pros Yay Im glad I watched this movie Now I know more about history the only 2 things I dont like are,4
72227,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,This is a really good movie  It has an awesome plot and was surprisingly based off of a childrens picture book that had less then twenty pages,2
72228,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,This movie has lots of adventure And a lot of comedy It  might be a little scary for little kids though,2
72229,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,This movie was great It was actionpacked and funny and taught you a few facts throughout history in a fun way  Definitely a mustwatch,3
72230,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,Seriously CSM Three stars This movie is so underrated  My entire family loves it  It has great characters a great plot and that twist at the end is amazing  SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT,6
72231,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,Mild infrequent swearing  A few subtextual references that would go over most kids heads  Some scenes including a scene where a wax figurine is run over and another where a mummy is unwrapped may be frightening to younger viewers,3
72232,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,this movie seems a bit scary at first for little ones but it all comes together as a really fun and hilarious movie   It is fun for all ages 7 and up,2
72233,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,Night at the Museum is not the best film but fun and good for kids  Warning the Civil war guys have masks on and may be a little creepy  This film is great but not for under seven  The old men disguise as goodies so can be quite scary,4
72783,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,I grew up watching this movie  I have lived in a very diverse area all of my life and this movie was always something  I could relate to   As a child I would get done with dinner and beg on my hands and knees to watch this movie   It got to the point that the movie just had to stay in the DVD player  I have seen a lot of bad reviews about this movie  I am wracking my brain as to why  It could be the scary themes represented but I cannot understand why it is such a big deal  A lot of movies have scary themes throughout  I also grew up loving Pocahontas and that is a terribly rated movie  If we allowed are children to watch movies with REAL LIFE SCENARIOS maybe our kids wouldnt be asshole or serial killers  Thank you very much,11
72784,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,Oliver and company was phenomenal     one of my favorite Disney movies of all time tied with the great mouse detective there are some kinda extreme scenes for little kids  one where desoto one of the evil Rottweilersgets hurt another where dodger main character puppy gets beaten up in a dog fight    and the adult human is told hes going to die if he doesnt pay his debts,1
72785,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,Love the music Oliver and Rita and dodger are my favorites Jenny is great to so is Winston and gorgette is kinda annoying bill sykes AWESOME,2
72786,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,I have LOVED this movie since I was pretty little  The plot is a little bit unoriginal and there are some bad role models Georgette is a conniving jealous diva  Fagan kidnaps a girls cherished pet kitten to pay off a debt  Dodger is kind of rude and uncaring at times but changes later  The villain in addition to being a total jerk smokes constantly But just so long as kids know not to mimic that behavior theyll be good  I think the main reason I love this movie so much is the music especially Why Should I Worry and Perfect isnt easy,6
72787,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,This movie has emotional elements including a kitten who is alone in the earlier scenes and some scary sequences including two meanacing dogs and an intenseviolent death of a certain character  There is even some mild consumerism including an image of the CocaCola logo some insults suggestive content messages and brief smoking  So its on for ages 9 iffy for ages 8 and off for ages 5,3
72788,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,Oliver and Company is an amazing movie Its so underrated everyone forgets about it but its really good  Its funny and it has good songs obviously because Billy Joel is in it it paved the way for the Disney Renaissance  which in my opinion are better than the classics Oliver and Company is not to be pushed aside,3
72789,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,Ive loved Disney films since I was born  No really  I was born in 93 and the first film I saw in a theater was The Lion King  I think of all the films I saw in the theater during the first few years of my life The Lion King and Oliver and Company hold the most special place in my heart  Ive seen TLK and other Disney classics many times over but Ive only recently rediscovered Oliver  The status of the film is a bit like its central character  this was originally a very popular film back when it was released in 1988 and even got a rerelease in 1996 where I was first exposed to its greatness but it took 7 years for it to get on home video had mostly mixedtonegative reviews and went from popular to criminally overlooked  In the 80s the dark period of Disney history Oliver and Company was the light at the end of the tunnel and it helped pave the way for the best films to come out of Disney since the Golden Age period that began with Snow White 1937 and ended with The Rescuers 1977  The Little Mermaid Beauty and the Beast Aladdin The Lion King and other films of the Disney Renaissance period the 90s were all created by the artists who started with Oliver and Company  But it doesnt give off the impression of being an experimental film it ends up being a true classic  Oliver is an orphaned kitten living on the streets of New York City  He fights to survive until he meets Dodger a dog voiced by the alwayscool Billy Joel who is initially resistant to Oliver but ends up liking him quite a bit  So much in fact that he introduces the kitten to his group of ragtag stray dogs including the dumb Einstein the smart Brit Francis the sassy Rita and the hilarious Tito  All of them help out a homeless man named Fagin who owns a large debt to a loan shark named Sykes one of the scariest villains in Disneys history  He owns two intimidating Dobermans and theyre both hostile towards Fagins gang  Then when Oliver learns how to survive hes adopted by a little rich girl named Jenny whose poodle Georgette is anything but pleased about  It all ends up becoming a tale of friendship and loyalty thats on par with anything Disney did during the Disney Renaissance  But the tone of this one is very gritty and realistic at points  a shock for Disney but still counterbalanced with happy songs and what not  For example the opening few minutes will make even the most hardhearted cry at least a little when Oliver is simply left alone in a dark and scary New York at night  But the song playing during this scene Huey Lewis Once Upon a Time in New York City is sad yet uplifting pointing towards better things that are yet to come  And that they do  The only other things to worry about are some mildly scary scenes when Jenny gets kidnapped by Sykes when the characters are threatened by Sykes Dobermans and the intense chase scene in the New York subway  Overall though CSM is wrong theyve got the same biased opinion on this as the film critics who havent appreciated it for what it is one of Disneys best classics  The music is awesome the animation is awesome the humor is awesome the voice acting is awesome   so yeah  In only a little bit over an hour Disney accomplishes more than most films of three hours can Just see this one You wont regret it,26
72790,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,If you dont know when you see Bill Sykes evil smirk with  sitting on the chair and holding his cigar that expression that looks like Shan Yu says how many men does it to deliver a message That is all I can say However Oliver And The War is the best crossover movie ever created  But I recommended for ages 18 and up because of lot of violence and Elmo is very thicc,3
72791,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,I like this movie  Its old cute got catchy music and has an interesting storyline  Alright so the interactions between two dogs was fine to a point then one wanted to talk to the other alone and he it took as    something else  The two dobbermans can seem intimidating  In conclusion a fun movie but children may need to be accompanied if they are sensitive,5
72792,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,The movie is awesome and I loved the songs streets of gold,1
72908,1990번,One Crazy Cruise,8,With only some mild teen kissing and flirting to worry about kids are perfectly fine to watch One Crazy Cruise  Expect a silly story along with messages about embracing change and coming together as a family,2
72909,1990번,One Crazy Cruise,8,This Movie is amazing Cody Simpson in this movie dating Ellie that  was how I thought it would end with a romantic ending LiarLiar Vampire was really badso after I watched it I binge watched One Crazy Cruise I saw Good Ratings on it on Imdb I wish it was on DVD So I could watch as many times I want  Nick Good Job,3
72910,1990번,One Crazy Cruise,8,It is a very nice movie one of my favorites,1
72911,1990번,One Crazy Cruise,8,My ratingPG for rude humor throughout,1
73115,1996번,Onward,6,This movie is about magic and how theres always a little magic inside you  I saw the movie on the TV and it was great  Its about 2 boys going on an adventure to try to bring their dad back in 24 hours  Theyll introduce more characters and events  There are hard obstacles they have to overcome great backup and heartful messages and not too much violence  There is some but not much  Overall this movie is great  DisneyPixar collaborations are great,8
73116,1996번,Onward,6,A really sweet story with just the right amount of adventure,1
73117,1996번,Onward,6,it was well done funny and had no language or sex  mild action  a iffy comment about a female officers girlfriend  an awesome familyfriendly flick,4
73118,1996번,Onward,6,Onward is the best movie of 2020 so far  Though the story is a bit lackluster generic rescue story they managed to make it work somehow  I almost cried 3 times which 1 time it succeeded  One time was when Ian was listening to his dad using the cassette boombox the time where I actually did cry was when Ian was sitting with dads halfbody realizing that Barley was just like a father figure to him and the last time when Barley hugged Ian at the end,4
73119,1996번,Onward,6,Its a good movie and I recommend it,1
73120,1996번,Onward,6,A lighthearted fantasy story with wonderful characters and powerful messages about family and selflessness  There is some combat but its not gory at all  I would recommend this to everyone,3
73121,1996번,Onward,6,I enjoyed Onward like I enjoyed many other Pixar films  Onward follows two boys who go on a journey to bring back their dad for a day  The stakes are high and the movie is interesting,3
73122,1996번,Onward,6,Its a mustwatch amazing movie that really surprised me  Its very heartwarming and I recommend it,2
73187,1998번,Open Season,8,Natureset animated comedy with scenes that spoof,1
73188,1998번,Open Season,8,Id recommend it  Its not every day you see computergenerated characters trampling computergenerated grass as they walk through it,2
73189,1998번,Open Season,8,Good but crude some positive messages,1
73190,1998번,Open Season,8,Unlike Tarzan 2 This film is not appropiate for ages 26 at all there is lots of profanity like Get off my tree you Fing squirrel and there is the word ass in the film but its hard to see Overall This film is not appropiate for ages 26 at all due to all of the bad language,1
73191,1998번,Open Season,8,This movie is watchable  But it has its bits of badnessbut overallthis movie is worth watching,2
73192,1998번,Open Season,8,This movie has everything the word CP fart jokes peeing jokes poop jokes horrible voice acting animation story characters everything  Pretty much this movie sucked  The only interesting part was the psychotic huntsman who has a gun and likes to go PEW PEW and tries to kill our notsobeloved heroes  For once I was on the antaganists side  This is an awful example to younger viewers  Oh DEER  See what I did there Because one of the main characters is a DEER Or DOE you not know what Im talking about ,10
73193,1998번,Open Season,8,This movie is kinda funny and I think it is a good family movie to watch  The only part that you want to know is that Shaw uses a gun to try to hunt the animals  Other than that I recommend you watch it,3
73194,1998번,Open Season,8,Personally I think it has a good story line and that little kids will laugh at the content  the only bit I may find a bit worrying is that they are being hunted and that when I was little it made me a bit afraid  It it OK though in my opinion as it ticked a lot of boxes but is was sad as the bear was separated from his mother and got PUT TO SLEEP  Be careful with your child as you would do with another p g,4
73195,1998번,Open Season,8,It was sooo boring Also one use of the C word  Im glad other users caught that  Heres the scene  Boog is sitting on some sort of haylike thing and Elliot is trying to convince him to poop  Then he says Come on start crappin   After that I changed it to The Spongebob Movie  Watch that movie instead,8
73338,2007번,"Our Friend, Martin",8,This movie was educational enough but there definitely was some iffy language   Also is this just me or did they draw a six grader like an eighteen yr old  I dunno if its just the drawing style but Maria seems a tad bit sexualized,3
73339,2007번,"Our Friend, Martin",8,There was some violence like old reallife videos of police assaulting protesters bullying and an offscreen shooting  A house is bombed as well and black kids are being called racial slurs  Along with drinking drugs and smoking a dad smokes in the car  The language is brief some mean words being called to people and a dad in a car yelling mean things to other cars in front of him,4
73340,2007번,"Our Friend, Martin",8,In some of them middle of the movie someones dad is smokeing,1
73663,2028번,Paddington,7,funny family friendly,1
73664,2028번,Paddington,7,This movie was pretty good But my 7 year old sister started freaking out at the crazy lady  She ran to the theater bathroom and stayed there for most of the duration of the movie  This was AWESOME  But the second movie was better,4
73665,2028번,Paddington,7,I really enjoyed this flimbut I think if you are under 8 you might get nightmares because theres a bit of violence in it which could scare little ones But its still a good flim,1
73666,2028번,Paddington,7,Beartastic  sorry about the pun it is amazing and heartfelt movie that has funny scenes   It is a movie that all ages can laugh at   Yes there is an evil woman that is trying to turn Paddington into a stuffed bear but there are so many other great scenes that are more memorable than that,4
73667,2028번,Paddington,7,Paddington is a fun family film at times but at other times you feel like it doesnt fit that description  I believe this is more of a scare than the sequel that came out recently  Millicent the main antagonist wants to stuff Paddington since he is part of a rare species and she wants him for her collection  This theme is believed by me to only go well with kids eight or older  There was an iffy word as well that probably isnt the best for a kidsfamily film  The word sexy is spoken in a scene where Mr  Brown dresses up as a lady  Paddington does bring a few good things like how Mr  Brown eventually got on board with the idea of having Paddington and the rest of the Brown family consider Paddington true family,7
73668,2028번,Paddington,7,This movie is really well done,2
73669,2028번,Paddington,7,PADDINGTON is a really positive movie about a family that find a bear and look after it  There may be scenes that are scary for young children but it is a very good movie,2
73670,2028번,Paddington,7,The movie kind of freaked me out and made me want to run screaming from the movie theatre,1
73671,2028번,Paddington,7,Why is it for six year olds I watched it with my little brother who is three and he seemed to like it  The best part is when Paddington did all those weird things in the bathroom,3
73672,2028번,Paddington,7,In this movie there is nothing to worry about  I just love the good messages that the all the good role models,2
73692,2028번,Paddington,7,The only parts i think were bad was when the women was flirting with the neighbor,1
73693,2028번,Paddington,7,Paddington is a great movie  The only thing I may worn is that even though Milicentnot telling who she is is not meant to be scary she may seem to be a little intence for kids younger then 8  Of course its a meant for family movie  There is nothing inapprocriate at all  This is from a kids point of view so adults may have a different opinion  Great movie overall though,6
73694,2028번,Paddington,7,I loved it  Ben Whishaw and the rest of the cast were excellent especially Whishaw as the voice of Paddington  One of the best family films I have ever seen,3
73695,2028번,Paddington,7,I think  that kids under 10 should NOT pay to watch this movie There is an evil animal and people murderer who is after Paddington mostly the whole movie  But it is still pretty sweet NO WAY so all I am trying to say is it is too violent and stressful for kids under ten,3
73696,2028번,Paddington,7,I think it is great  but there is mild violence so I rated it eight and up,1
73697,2028번,Paddington,7,Great Movie 4 Paddington rated PG 5 OF 5 STARS ON Review SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Good,2
73698,2028번,Paddington,7,Great movie funny and family friendly  A few funny references to the mission impossible series which young kids may not get  fine for children but Paddington himself is put in a lot of peril being shot at getting stuck in an incinerator and being put in a taxidermy van  The family itself has gret messages and paddington is a funny charecter their is a scene where Ms byrd is in a drinking contest and appears drunk even though they are never shown drinking alcohol  I also think your kids might be tempted to buy paddington books and stuffed animals,4
73699,2028번,Paddington,7,I think it was really good because it had lots of good messageshumor and great role models  Kids between the ages of 10  12 may not like it as much although,2
73700,2028번,Paddington,7,This movie was great What an awesome story everyone should watch this  There is some stuff sensitive parents may feel is not appropriate for younger children like the fact that the main antagonist is trying to stuff paddington  But nothing violent is shown so its fine for ages 6 and up and iffy for ages 5 and under,4
73701,2028번,Paddington,7,Funny funny funny  Cant escape from funnyland  When Paddington went on his bathtub boat was my favorite part,3
73787,2038번,Paper Planes,7,Can be a bit sad but it is good,1
73788,2038번,Paper Planes,7,Paper planes is a really good film but its sad at times  Kimi and Dylan pretty nice,2
73789,2038번,Paper Planes,7,Pretty cool,1
73790,2038번,Paper Planes,7,paper planes is the best movie ever,2
73791,2038번,Paper Planes,7,The movie is ok but a bit with acupuncture might be scary for young kids  There isnt any blood,2
73792,2038번,Paper Planes,7,PAPER PLANES is nearly overflowed with positive messages  I think it is a great film for families,2
73793,2038번,Paper Planes,7,Im using this film for a film study at school so I watched the movie for the first time not some thing I usually watch but surprisingly overall I loved this movie now one of my favourite movies it show cases that bullys can turn into friends and your family can be once again your rock if you give them time to heal from their scares,1
73794,2038번,Paper Planes,7,Its amazing but it is  sad in some parts  Its inspired  me to make my own paper planes and to give things a go,2
74402,2060번,Pearl Harbor,8,The movie is fantastic It portrayed Pearl Harbor and what people may have thought during the attack perfectly  I recommend But watch out when watching with younger kids There is language and lots of violence but still a fantastic movie,6
74403,2060번,Pearl Harbor,8,War in Hawaii that Japanese were attacking,1
74404,2060번,Pearl Harbor,8,Good war movie,1
74405,2060번,Pearl Harbor,8,This movie is recommended for a 12,1
74406,2060번,Pearl Harbor,8,Its a Michael bay movie so its really bad,1
74407,2060번,Pearl Harbor,8,I have no idea why people say this movie is bad like on imdb they gave it a 6 1 which is a d I mean come on yes the story is fake but well acted and interesting some language I believe ther is at least one f word and possibly 2 but very good movie,1
74408,2060번,Pearl Harbor,8,25 on Rotten Tomatoes is still too good of a review for this movie  I wasnt even paying attention to it writing on my computer while it was playing in the same room and I was so distressed by the  utter cheesiness of it that I had to leave the room,2
74409,2060번,Pearl Harbor,8,My ratingR for strong brutal war violence throughout language throughout and brief sexuality,1
74791,2092번,Pitch Perfect,8,This is a great musical movie  I know people as young as 7 watch this but I think waiting till 13 is a better idea,2
74792,2092번,Pitch Perfect,8,Pitch Perfect is a great movie that cuts right to the heart but it also has a lot of swearing consumerism and a bit of sex  Very good messages about never giving up  but kids under 11  might want to think twice about it,2
74793,2092번,Pitch Perfect,8,Enough said,1
74794,2092번,Pitch Perfect,8,This movie has to be my favorite movie of all time  I have seen it over 10 times and it never gets old   The singing and acting is amazing and the movie is over all hilarious,3
74795,2092번,Pitch Perfect,8,I loved this movie so much I watched it in the plane and I needed up laughing out loud at so many parts  I feel like the other passengers on the plane thought I was a little weird  The music and dancing is also really amazing  It makes me just want to get up and start grooving   I defiantly recommend this movie for teens,6
74796,2092번,Pitch Perfect,8,I am 13 and I loved this movie you have to be kinda mature to  see it there is some language issues but it didnt bother me any   There is at least 2 or 3 scenes were she throws up  But again that didnt bother me  I absolutely loved it and think other kids my age would to,4
74797,2092번,Pitch Perfect,8,This movie is halarious and great for a mature 11 year old  Some inappropriate things were said like bich and sit  In the beginning a girl introduce herself to Becca the main character and tells her where her room and gives her a whistle and says This is your official Bardon university rapist whistle  Do blow it unless its really happening  Also there were a bunch of college kids at a party drinking and one girl says that she needs her jiggle juice  One girl admits to having lots of sx  One point in an a cepella riff offa battle between a Capella groups they have categories and one of them was songs about sx and then they started singing about it  That was a little awkward when watching it  Overallthis movie was entertaining and fun to watch other than the bad stuff  I loved it and Im still waiting to see the second one,10
74798,2092번,Pitch Perfect,8,This movie fallows Beca a girl in collage who is a DJ  At the school there a five acapella groups and one of then is the Barden Bellas the best acapella group there is the troubles  Then beca gets invited to join the Bellas after they lost a conniption because on of the Bellas threw up on everyone  So then Beca decideds to join and try to them good again  This movie is extremely vulgar and racy there is tons of gay and lesbian jokes implied racy content a scene in a show with breasts visible extremely crass and explicit references about racy content some kissing and some inappropriate gestures  There is also tons of constant vulgar language including 30 uses of st fk sltbags dk py ps  etc  There is lots of underage drinking partying and drug use throughout  There is no violence at all but its suspenseful if ether going to win or not  This movie is fantastic amazing hilarious fun and enjoyable but to racy for teens  My ratingR for strong racy contentnudity throughout pervasive language graphic nudity strong alcohol and drug use and vulgar references,10
74966,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Great comedy has only one bad scene when a man says the FWord about 30 times in a row  The rest is either a light PG13 or a strong PG,2
74967,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Good but smoking and language,1
74968,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Although this movie  has an iconic tirade with fk repeatedly just about everything else is PGappropriate  It is a great thanksgiving movie for somewhat older kids and a very funny movie anytime,2
74969,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Funny comedy just has a brief scene of strong language okay for kids 11 and up,1
74970,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,One of the best comedies,1
74971,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Planes  trains and automobiles is a funny yet sad comedy about two strangers whos flight is delayed and they share a room together and go on an adventure  Ther is a scene with a lot of uses of the f word and more language   through the whole movie  It is not sexual or crude  Must watch,4
74972,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Sure theres some bad language but its not horrible and its very funny and great for kids 10 if you are younger than 10 I recommend you have a parent approval  Enjoy the movie,2
74973,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,As far as I can say this is a very good movie although I did see some adultish jokes I think this is perfectly suitable for kids 13,1
74974,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Honestly this movie is fine for 13 year olds if you skip the scene in which Steve Martin uses the dreaded Fbomb  this actually would have been a pg movie if they would have removed this scene  The only major issue here is the language,3
74975,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,I like how two friends stay together to get to the guys house  It shows how you should stay together no matter what  Thats just what you do,3
75100,2107번,Poltergeist,7,This movie is good but has a one minute sequence of flashing lights in the beginning and a really long sequence of flashing lights 1520 minutes near the end  So this movie contains a lot of sequences of flashing lights that may affect viewers with epilepsy or any other photosensitivity,2
75101,2107번,Poltergeist,7,I think this movie is great for youngsters who like scarygory stuff,1
75102,2107번,Poltergeist,7,Poltergeist has not aged well  It also isnt that scary  The tree coming to life and the goofy clown doll dont just scare like they should  Some scenes work well though  The nightmarish scene when the man tears his face in the mirror is truly great stuff  Overall though not particularly frightening,6
75103,2107번,Poltergeist,7,If you can watch Harry Potter it is fine for you,1
75104,2107번,Poltergeist,7,Aside from the face peeling scene  in which the effects are quite outdated  this movie has no blood and gore and leaves the scares to the supernatural happenings throughout the film  It is definitely not however for any kids under 1011 as it brings the kids beloved toy into the evil action with the  already creepy  toy clown  It is scary but the parents set great examples because they are very committed to saving their family  A few swear words are included but overall there isnt too much profanity,4
75105,2107번,Poltergeist,7,This is the cheesiest trippiest ghost film ever   I know it was original when it came out but now everything in it is clich and poorly executed compared to its followers  A small amount of violence and the parents do drugs but nothing much else inappropriate  Dont watch this film for entertainment  I guess its worth watching if you want to see the inspiration behind better ghost films such as insidious and the conjuring  25 stars,6
75106,2107번,Poltergeist,7,Poltergeist is a family horror movie that is fairly scary  The violence isnt too bad but in one particularly gross scene a man rips his face off and reveals his bloody skull  The scene is in the mans head which could make it a little less frightening  The family is fearless and strong in the face of danger and will stop at nothing to bring back their daughter from the Other Side  They can teach kids to always work for what you want and dont give up  The swearing is fairly moderate with a few cases of btch st damn and hell  Overall this movie should be suitable for a 10 yo child,7
75107,2107번,Poltergeist,7,Steven Spielberg classic   Good but scary,2
75301,2111번,Ponyo,6,I just watched this movie with my little sister today  We both loved it and Im 14 It was really cute and I love Miyazakis movies  Studio Ghiblis artwork and animation is beautiful and amazing  Even if you think youre too old for it go see it anyway you wont be disappointed,5
75302,2111번,Ponyo,6,This Movie is My Fav Movie Ever It Made Me Love Anime Now I Watch Fruits Basket Toradora and Other Animes all Because of This Movie and I Watched When I Was 6 and Became an Instant Miyazaki Fan  I Really Love This Movie,3
75303,2111번,Ponyo,6,A great movie Mostly for younger kids but your older ids can still watch it and I dont now how they couldnt love it,2
75304,2111번,Ponyo,6,I am a huge fan of Studio Ghiblis films  The animation is fantastic and the plot is very cute  I dont know why people are having a cow over the breastfeeding line though because THATS WHAT THEYRE FOR  Its better for kids to learn here instead of school right Anyways yeah I love all of Mizayakis works and this is definatley a good movie,5
75305,2111번,Ponyo,6,Firstly let me get one thing clear this wasnt a bad film  I actually think its a good opportunity for family members to come together and watch a friendly film with the kids  Its cute and strange definitely  visually breathtaking  These are all very good things that keep kids enlightened and entertained But for the most part Ponyo is simply a story about a little fish girl who falls in love with a human boy and they spend the entire movie acting cute while the world ends  There are two points I need to address here one being the storyline is just fine for kids but for adults it could get boring  I mean all it really is is this adorable fiveyearold love story which to be honest with you isnt overwhelming  But what about the world ending you ask isnt that overwhelming That is what I am going to address in my second point  The whole issue with the world ending I think that was just Hayao Miyazakis attempt to throw some massive adventure in there and to tell you the truth I think he COULD have done better  The end of the world as we all now is a major deal  However the people in the movie treat it as a minor inconvenience as if they hadnt just lost all their homes and possessions  Also nobody even questions why all this is happening or why there are frightening ancient fish underwater  They simply go along with it which I gotta say is the very thing that makes this movie underwhelming  Its underwhelming people put in and overwhelming situation and when that happens you KNOW the situation is going to be a whole lot more bland than before  So in itself Ponyo is a memorable film mostly for its quirkiness and nonstop adorableness  Seriously the cutsey moments in this movie are too much to bare  This paired with the fantastic animation is why most people tend to see Ponyo as a masterpiece  With all this in mind Pony now seems a bit overrated to me  I mean sure its a pretty good movie except for the story and it did its job well as a kids film  But theres allot of waiting and once I saw Ponyo the second time I fell asleep halfway through  Some things parents need to know This movie is perfect for kids  Its not scary or spooky its just different and strange but sometimes people mix up the two  Ponyo is a good film for all ages Most of the time,24
75306,2111번,Ponyo,6,I love this movie to death I remember going to theaters watching this with my mom in the summer time  This is a great movie for little kids but they might get a funny feeling watching the kind of animation  I suggest this for 9yrs and up but you can let your children watch it  When I was 5 I liked anime a little bit  But now Im a lover of anime Watch this with your kids its a must see In the summer time when it is raining outside I go watch some anime movies or some shows and if my big brother isnt busyhe watches anime too  Me and my brother are freaks of anime movies and shows  Try and do that with your family,10
75307,2111번,Ponyo,6,great movie,1
75559,2133번,Princess Mononoke,8,I would say that the creepiest things in the movie were the demons  both were covered in wormssnakes  there is lots of violence even though the main character kind of uses violence as a last resort  2 peoples heads are shot off of their bodys using arrows  and there is lots of blood  there is some profanity I completely loved the movie,6
75560,2133번,Princess Mononoke,8,Beauty meets violence in this gorgeously crafted anime movie  Ashitaka is a young prince in a faroff village protecting his people with his life along with his trusty elk Yakul  When he is inflicted with a terrible demons curse he sets out on an epic adventure to find his true self lift the curse and save the forest  But into his midst comes a mysterious princess known as Princess Mononoke  This is probably one of Hayao Miyazakis greatest  and more violent  movies  The animation is absolutely breathtaking Miyazaki can craft anything from an agile red elk to a sparkling tranquil forest to a demongod larger than an elephant  But watch out for graphic violence  SPOILER ALERTS At the beginning of the movie Ashitaka and his friend are attacked by a horrible demon that appears to be a boar covered in swirling worms  When Ashitaka kills it the flesh disappears from its body and the bloody skeleton is left behind  However Ashitaka is left with a steaming wound that the elders say is destined to kill him  Kids might be upset when Ashitaka has to leave the only home hes ever known to lift the curse upon him  At another village Ashitaka witnesses a bloody massacre in which his wounded arm swells and seems to has a mind of its own it causes him to accidentally cut off someones arms and another persons entire head  In a heavy rainstorm Lady Eboshi and her men fight a wolf one person shoots the wolf and sets it on fire briefly and it falls off a cliff  Later we see Princess Mononoke usually called San come into the story for the first time she finds the old wolf on the banks of a river and she sucks and spits out the blood from the wolfs bullet wound her mouth becomes covered in blood  After Ashitaka arrives in Irontown the central village of the story San attacks the citizens of Irontown along with her two wolfs there is a sword fight between San Ashitaka and Lady Eboshi  When Ashitaka knocks Lady Eboshi unconscious he is shot through the stomach but continues to advance through the village without any apparent struggle  An ancient boar called Okkoto becomes covered in the same swirling worms as the boar at the beginning of the movie and San becomes trapped within the worms on his face Okkoto appears to become a demon and San almost becomes one too  One of the main conflicts of the story is based on the keeping of the peace between the humans and the forest  However not all want it to be that way  Lady Eboshi strives to kill the Forest Spirit and give the head of the creature to a man named Jigo who says he will help her people in return  She succeeds in cutting off the head of the spirit of the forest the rest of the spirits body turns into a creature made of dark lifelike ooze that kills a living thing instantly upon contact  Lady Eboshis arm is then bitten off by a wolf  These are just a portion of the many violent scenes of this movie all of which are fairly bloody and gory but are still amazing and entrancing to watch  Language includes damn piss and bastard but there is really no sex  For those who are afraid of blood or watching peoples limbs get ripped from their bodies this will be too scary andor violent  But for those who are huge Miyazaki fans and are okay with the violence bloody and all it will be an actionpacked joyride that they wont soon forget,26
75561,2133번,Princess Mononoke,8,OK first off this movie is violent  People are killed and peoples limbs fall off  The PG13 rating is right,3
75562,2133번,Princess Mononoke,8,What you need to know is I hate gory movies although this movie did have some gore All the violence in the beginning is pretty quick and at some parts comical  near the end it gets pretty gory but is still manageable  There are a lot of people on hear saying they showed it to their six year old Its rated pg13 so you dont show it to youngsters I mean really cmon people the front has a picture of a girl with blood on her face and guy with a sword and scar  If you cannot handle gore whatsoever dont watch this  If you can handle some and not get scared watch it right now it is so good,5
75563,2133번,Princess Mononoke,8,It is violent but not too violent  when i first watched it i was 8 and i loved it,2
75564,2133번,Princess Mononoke,8,An absolutely amazing movie with intense action fair amounts of blood an amazing soundtrack and an amazing story that you wont forget anytime soon  This movie is amazing and a great choice for families that enjoy Japanese movies and anime,2
75565,2133번,Princess Mononoke,8,The animation and story is very unique and focuses on the story of a teenage boy trying to lift a curse caused by a hateful demon  It discusses how violence and hatred brings trouble to people and how humans are destroying the environment with their greed  A more mature and significantly better animated Fern Gully  I would NOT recommend this to anyone who doesnt like blood or body gore there is only 23 scenes with this but I found it uncomfortable to watch  I also noticed a few cuss words ass a few times damn 34 times and bastard once,5
75566,2133번,Princess Mononoke,8,This is the sequel to the 1995s hit The Flying Castle but this 1 adds more gory violence and graphic killing with lots of gore  This drama has tons of bloodygraphicdisturbing and shocking violence characters are slicedstabbedshotblown to bits etc  There are also lots of gory images including a girl eating a wolf and spitting the blood from her mouthblood is seen splatteringlots of pools blood and some very graphic woundssome disturbing and very gory content  There is no swearing or racy content but there is some drinking and flirting  This sequel is epic and very thrilling but due to strong bloody violence its and iffy choice for teens  My ratingR for bloody and graphic violence throughoutdisturbing contentimagesand intense sequences of gruesome and bloody images,6
76188,2147번,Pulp Fiction,7,The worst part about it is how much it swears particularly the f word  Unlike most of Quentin Tarantinos other films Pulp Fiction is not very violent  It has a bit of blood and a few shootings  This is definitely my favourite film by Tarantino if not my favourite of all time  A must watch for mature people aged 13 and up,5
76189,2147번,Pulp Fiction,7,Im 14 and this is my favourite movie of all time  The acting is great the violence is brutal and the screenplay is legendary  Everybody should see this movie,4
76190,2147번,Pulp Fiction,7,Pulp Fiction is one of Tarantinos greatest films making great use of the film and using it to tell a brilliant story  However after all this is a Tarantino film with extreme violence sex and language  Children shouldnt have access to this film anyway and for teenagers it depends on their maturity  Pulp Fiction is a really good film aided by perfect storytelling but contains mainly A LOT of violence,4
76191,2147번,Pulp Fiction,7,Many people consider Pulp Fiction to be Quentin Tarantinos greatest film and thats hard to argue  Included are some of his best characters dialogue and music  The film follows three stories of two hit men reclaiming their bosss briefcase one of them later taking the bosss wife to dinner and a boxer in a fixed fight who goes on the run after winning the fight  One of the funniest movies of all time and one of the best written Pulp Fiction is a knockout film recommended for mature teens with a dark sense of humor,4
76192,2147번,Pulp Fiction,7,Its a Tarantino movie so you know what to expect violence drug use gore etc   My friend recommended me this movie about a month ago and I have to say I was skeptic at first but when I saw this movie goddamn You have to watch this its one of the best movies out there,3
76193,2147번,Pulp Fiction,7,Watching this movie is really a kidbykid thing  I watched it at age 14 but if your child is uncomfortable watching violence and hearing swear words or you are uncomfortable with it maybe this movie isnt for them  There are some eye covering moments  It is a very clever film that everyone should watch in their lifetime,4
76194,2147번,Pulp Fiction,7,I watched this with my roommate Toby and we thought it was great   Nothing is real   I know a place where we can go together   Do you hear me Allison  Could you ever   I know you didnt like it here but this is too far   Theyre telling me to pull the plug   Can you hear,8
76195,2147번,Pulp Fiction,7,This is without doubt Tarantinos best film I have seen almost all of his movies and this is the one that sticks out in my memory  Almost every line in the movie makes for a great quote  One of John Travoltas best films and Samuel L  Jackson is excellent as always  There is however a good deal of violence  Lots of blood and gore a couple very violent scenes are set in a very humorous tone  Man accidentally shot in the face sets off comedic dialogue  There is a torture scene a man is slashed by a katana a man is shot in the private area another person is shot in the leg a guy gets run over by a car etc    etc    As for langauge    Well this movie actually set the record for the most uses of the Fword in a single film  271 to be exact also quite a few racial slurs as well as other various assorted cussing  Also there is some sexual content implied oral sex appears off screen a man is briefly shown being raped    etc    Yet another major factor would be the drug use many characters shoot up with heroin one girl overdoses main characters use drugs like some would take aspirin,10
76196,2147번,Pulp Fiction,7,This movie is violent but funny IF your teens want to watch it consider talking to them that this movie can be very funny but violent commonsensemedia says its not for kids but when theyre like 1215 i guess you could start saying that they can watch it but if they are scared turn it off immediately so you could give them a restriction so until theyre 18 they can watch it but you dont generally need to do it im just saying that thats good  because this movie generally makes it not for kids to get money and stuff like that only just because they want to make money for adults dosent mean that you cant give it for kids under 18 and because of that never mind the violence and sex so like give them a huge educational value so inorder to watch it,1
76246,2149번,Puss in Boots,7,Its a swashbuckling adventure that features the irresistible warrior cat,1
76247,2149번,Puss in Boots,7,It is hilarious but has some rude humor that adults will get but not little kids  It has some suitable lessons like trust and the bond between friends  My family enjoys it every time but personally I think it is best if whoever is watching it is at least 7 or 8,3
76248,2149번,Puss in Boots,7,This show is very good but I think the death character in this movie is too scary,1
76249,2149번,Puss in Boots,7,I loved everything about the movie most movies have a pros and cons list but I cant think of anything negative to say about this The pacing was good the villan atchually scared me and the story was easy to understand I didnt come out of the theater with questions as usual  I am putting 5 and up because they do reference curse words by bleeping the characters and cutting to another scene,5
76250,2149번,Puss in Boots,7,Funny sweethearted take on classic hero,1
76251,2149번,Puss in Boots,7,I have seen the 2011 SpinOff and it is one of my favorite DreamWorks SpinOffs next to Penguins Of Madagascar Guys its Puss In Boots thats the way he is you watched Shrek and it was inappropriate and Puss In Boots is a part of the Shrek Franchise,1
76252,2149번,Puss in Boots,7,Contains cartoonish fantasy violence throughout not many sexual content apart from Puss being coo over his flirtatious sidekick little to no profanity  There is a gag about how catnip mimics marijuana and how it cures Puss glaucoma,2
76253,2149번,Puss in Boots,7,Wella movie about Puss in Boots  It doesnt work 100with the wrting being somewhat weak and the new characters unmemorablebut at least Antonito reprises his role and the animation is good,2
76254,2149번,Puss in Boots,7,This movie should always have a five star rating   Its awesome Many people may like it,3
76471,2173번,Raggs,8,I agree with everyone else  The 2001 version of this show is classic  This modern version is garbage,3
76472,2173번,Raggs,8,This show ruined my childhood  The original which came out in 2001 NOT the 90s as some parents have claimed was waaaay better than this pile of garbage  The Raggs band started in 1990 which is probably why they think the original show started then  The show didnt exist till 2001  Anyways the original show was much better  The dogs were cuter the music was more fun the dogs interacted with humans their voices were much better than the poor voice acting done here and most importantly NO DUMPSTER I cannot believe they went and ruined a perfect show  Ugh just watch the original series instead of this pile of trash,8
76473,2173번,Raggs,8,This show is just a ripoff of 321 Contact  Watch the Doodlebops instead,2
76474,2173번,Raggs,8,One episode had Razzles cry over a hat and its not even funny,1
76475,2173번,Raggs,8,The music is great but the costumes scared me as a kid,1
76556,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,Ralph is a big baby in this  It shows the dark web and criminal activity  And when Ralph and Vanellope were at eBay Vanellope looked at sections and said Sports     food    big baby clothes Something called lingerie    Should they be putting tHAT IN A KIDS MOVIE And Ralph and Vanellope go to a root beer cavern and seem pretty strange after,6
76557,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,i love it ,1
76558,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,Slighty swearing no nudity slighty violence but too much consumerism theres fortniteinstagram ebay youtube GTA disney DC Marvel and more Great role models,2
76559,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,I think this movie is very creative and good for younger kids   but its kind of cheesy for older kids,2
76560,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,Disney has out done itself by going out to explore the internet world This is an amazing sequel although I prefer it to be watched by kids 10 and above due to high violence and the internet has some crazy stuff not for kids  It also depicts the strength of friendship,3
76561,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,AWESOME NEED TO WATCH,1
76562,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,Ralph Breaks The Internet has quite a bit of consumerism and most people wont leave without knowing the name of one of the companies shown in the film   While traveling into the Dark Web we do encounter many scary viruses and glitches though    The movie is still okay for young audiences though,3
76563,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,The movie itself was pretty solid with it emphasizing about tech today and using terms and and tips to help kids today use the internet  The thing is that the plot is confusing  SPOILERS AHEAD,4
76564,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,Sequels are supposed to be more mature and darker but this film  Its more friendlier and better  I love how every single moment of this movie especially when they reach the internet because almost everything they saw in the internet was real except that Google was Mr Knowsmore and Buzzztube was YouTube  I 100 recommend to everyone except preschooler because this movie has a lot of very mild swearing and the virus scene is very scary for younger or sensetive kids  Look I watched this when I was 11 I was still scared when Ralph became a virus  So dont worry,6
76565,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,really good,1
76692,2179번,Rango,7,I really liked this movie  My 13 year old brother 8 year old sister my mom and I all watched this movie together  My brother said it was okay my sister kept on asking me what was going on though she also really liked it  however my mom and I were very happy with everything,3
76693,2179번,Rango,7,I watched this movie with my little brothers one 9 and the other   4  I wish they werent there  Good thing they dont understand movies like this  Here,4
76694,2179번,Rango,7,This is one of the most suckish movies ive ever seen My sisters LOVED it but I was bored to death,2
76695,2179번,Rango,7,dont watch itbad movieit swearshas sexual stuffand consumerismand drinking horrible choice awful,2
76696,2179번,Rango,7,This movie is terrible with its foul language and its blasphemous religious act towards something  Dont see it  Not even without your kids  Its a waste of time,4
76697,2179번,Rango,7,I think that Rango is a  perfect movie for the younger kids  It also has a positive message It is a powerful story  Also there is nothing that could possibly wrong with this movie  The names are creative all the way to the characters,5
76698,2179번,Rango,7,Great movie a really good take on westerns  There was a good deal of language stuff like dn hell and even bch which is not heard over the cry of a hawk  A lot of shooting and guns which is typical of a western and when Rango walks into the saloon there is smoking drinking and card playing going on  Plenty of humor though not all of it is for younger kids  Some kissing  Overall plenty of fun but best for ages 8 and up,6
76699,2179번,Rango,7,Ok when the trailers first came on TV I was like Oh I want to see that movie But my mom didnt but she got me the DVD because it was about a LIZARD  It does not matter if the movies about an animal I watched it with my 16year old cousin and we were BOTH terrified I was screaming and I had to hold a stuffed animal  My cousin was vomiting  And the Indian scene I feel sorry for my Grandma who is half Native American Then me and my cousin burned the DVD And threw the DVD case onto the road  I explained to my parents and now They will never let me watch Rango again  Stay FAR away from this movie,11
76700,2179번,Rango,7,Many reviews say Not for kids or 13 Im 14 and this movie was really bad You might like it if you are into animation or like western style but I truely hated it  The only good thing about this movie was that Johnny Depp stared in it  5 stars for Johnny Depp and a great big Boo to the film makers  Horrible job advertising this movie on childrens T V stations and then flipping it around to be for adults  Teens hated it    Children cant watch it    So why exactly is an animation about a lizard who swears supposed to be for any teen adult or child NOT recommended,9
76701,2179번,Rango,7,I loved this movie   I think other  people should see it,2
76826,2181번,Ratatouille,6,Cute rat tale has some peril and potentially scary moments,1
76827,2181번,Ratatouille,6,Some people might say that the characters in Ratatouille are unrealistic but actually the characters include a lot of true and dramatic character traits like rudeness and jealousy  Not only are the traits in the characters is fabulous but also the storyline is great  The story started out with the main character introducing himself to us then as the rat family got exposed they were forced to the drain which led them to Paris  In Paris he succeeded in his dreams  I like how the story included the dish Occitan Occitan is a French Provenal dish of stewed vegetables  About the theme main lesson in a story there was a man that kept jumping out to tell the rat not to give up or stop his dreams  For example sometimes in life risking your dreams or doing something unexpected can lead to a successful ending,7
76828,2181번,Ratatouille,6,I  pirated this movie and still want a refund,1
76829,2181번,Ratatouille,6,Remy a provincial rat with a wonderful sense of smell hates garbage and risks death to enter a human kitchen where he discovers real food and the cooking of fivestar chef Anton Gusteau author of Anyone Can Cook  On the day Remy learns his hero has died he is evicted and ends up alone in Paris  By luck he discovers Gasteaus restaurant down to three stars and run by a frozenfoodhawking chef  As Remy enters so does Linguini a clumsy youth hired as a garbage boy  To save the soup that Linguini accidentally fouls Remy throws in some ingredients the soup is a success and Linguinis career as a chef is born  Can Remy find a way to maintain the fiction and use his gift,6
76830,2181번,Ratatouille,6,this is a work of art,1
76831,2181번,Ratatouille,6,This movie changed my life,1
76832,2181번,Ratatouille,6,A classic that I think is great for anyone,1
76833,2181번,Ratatouille,6,I was watching this movie and it was fine until I heard someone say Ratatooing here and also one problem is that theres no Mickey Mouse here  Education Value has none there is a some drinking and it says Ratatooing a lot  It catches Atai Omurzakov dancer man as WALLE  And yeah I recommend for 22,3
77060,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,i love this movie every time i watch i i pick up on something new that just adds to the story and makes it so much better and its so interesting,1
77061,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,so let me get this out first  I couldnt really focus on the movie so my review might have mistakes,2
77062,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Its fine  Nothing I personally enjoyed  The animation and voice acting do make it bearable  Its not the best of Disneys animated movies but its perfectly serviceable family entertainment  I didnt have that much interest in it but Im sure others will,5
77063,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Raya and the Last Dragon was another fun heroine movie from Disney I liked it but Raya looks just like Moana and the storyline is kind of like it too  Overall its worth it to watch it though  I think kids 67 and up are totally ok to watch it,4
77064,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Good ol movie  Has good action scenes and messages but heres a quick tip for parents Sometimes they imply swear words like a and b,2
77065,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,I dont want to pay 30 plus my existing Disney Plus subscription  Aquafina is awful and so is her design  It looks like a 4 year old picked up crayons and drew her mom a blue dragon  I dont understand how Disney went from Moana to Rays and the last dragon  It is unfunny and cringe worthy  I dont know why this film attempts to immerse you in the time period when you have Aquafina making a joke about being in a school project  Why was this in the movie Maybe she is a time traveler like the genie  I normally dont get this mad over Disney movies but I am mad  I payed 30 dollars and wished I got that money back  I dont underestimate Disneys talent because this movie is gorgeous but that doesnt fix the multiple problems  Im sorry Disney but you need to get your act together  There is a positive message hidden behind the lackluster jokes but it is covered in Disneys blockbuster coat,13
77066,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Positive messages a bit tense at moments,1
77067,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Raya and the Last Dragon is a great film  I really hoped this film could live up to my expectations and for the most part it did  It feels pretty good to have a good Disney film again considering I hadnt loved some of their newest films  Im not sure if its worth 30 to watch it on Disney but the decision is up to you,4
77068,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,this movie is such a good family movie  People get turned into statues by an evil spirit thing but thats as bad as it gets  it is very funny there is some fighting there is no swearing and the main charicters are great role models,3
77069,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Great,1
78107,2264번,Royal Wedding,8,This movie is really romantic and great dancing   Fred Astaire and Jane Powell are great dancers and really a cute brother and sister  in the movie ,2
78832,2315번,Scooby-Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur,6,Amazing,1
78833,2315번,Scooby-Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur,6,I think this was too scary for younger kids   A good movie for tweens but nothing younger,2
79282,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,Its appropriate I liked how it included Rich Brian and 88 rising,1
79283,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,This was a great way to get back to theaters  This movie lived up to my expectations  The whole time my heart was racing it could have been the butter on my popcorn but that doesnt matter  The fight choreography is stunning the writing is fine as wine in the summertime  The costumes are to the nine and the visual effects are breathtaking  I highly recommend this movie,6
79284,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,great fight scenes and amazing cgi safe for most kids and even toddlers to watch,1
79285,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,very good movie with good messages and themes  super funny movie that the whole family should enjoy,3
79286,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,There is some language a few uses of st and one mouthing of fk  Lots of martial arts violence  Cast is mainly Asian  Movie has great messages,4
79287,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,Parents in my opinion the only thing you really need to worry about is when someone  says the v word once  However this is only based on your childs maturity,2
79288,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,I think kids should see this to know that there are all sorts of heroes not only white americans  Great ChineseAmerican tale amazing storyline and phenominal graphics  A joke about a ladys genitals and BS jacka sht hell damn and btch were repeated a lot throughout the movie so watch out for that  Amazing messages but a lot of violence and gore  A man was kicked in the testicles once  Otherwise amazing,6
79289,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,VIOLENCE Shangs father built quite a reputation after his wife died by killing those responsible  But it didnt end there  He continued his brutal behavior for another 10 years before his wife started calling to him asking him to safe her  Spoilers The voice was not his wife but a mimic created by the ancient beast called the Dweller  Similar creatures end up attacking a village sucking the souls from its occupants  To describe the process the creatures grab the victim and absorb a glowing orb from their body their soul  Other fighting sequences in the movie are mainly martial arts  People are stabbed punched and kicked in all sorts of ways  Some assassins fall from tall scaffolding and some fall off cliffs,9
79290,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,I loved this movie It got a little confusing at the end but it was still amazing  It was also very funny   If you are worried about inappropriate stuff the girl Katy references vagina 2 times    when they are talking abt childbirth and abt changing names normal name Gina to slang gina I love this movie though,6
79291,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,SHANG CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS  The movie was EXCELLENT and for me i am a huge huge huge MARVEL fan and for me it is on of the best some languege Like S and B and stuff like that violence is average for 10 and over either then that you should approve to watch the movie GREAT MOVIE,2
79391,2361번,Sharknado,8,I think Sharknado is an awesome movie but there is a lot of vilonse and suffering between character  There is also a few kissing sense  Also the language is very harsh  Other than that Sharknado is a great movie There is also a great role model,5
79392,2361번,Sharknado,8,This is a great BMovie for ages 10 and up  The whole plot of the movie is laughing as people are killed by sharks that fall out of the sky but its so bad that its good  The only thing to worry about is violence and gore which looks like a video game  So if your kids can handle Call of Duty theyll be fine  This movie is great for a movie night,5
79393,2361번,Sharknado,8,This movie is so funny It is literally the worst movie I have ever seen which makes it that much better You should watch it Sharks start swarming in a hurricane and rain down on people  Everything is fake and really hilarious  The main characters are comical and sometimes a little stupid  A lot gets destroyed and a few people die  But its obviously fake so it will not scare most people  However dont show it to your little kids,9
79394,2361번,Sharknado,8,This movie interested me because I like shark stuff  There is plenty of violence in this movie  Sharks eating people or even just biting off their legs or their arms  There is a tornado with sharks inside and they have to find a way to survive  A girl is inside a shark and it shows you a man cutting the shark and taking her out of it  There is no sex besides kissing and the language is not strong  People say shit and hell and that is all  There is some drinking in this movie but you should not be worried about that  Nothing happens after they drink they do not get drunk or anything like that  I think that this movie is okay for kids ages 14 and up because most of the deaths are gruesome  WATCH IT IF YOU ARE 14 AND OLDER THOUGH BECAUSE IT IS AN AMAZING MOVIE,11
79395,2361번,Sharknado,8,This movie is amazing  There is a lot of blood and I mean a lot  But the blood looks fake   Their is some bad language but I think that a twelve year old kid should be allowed to watch it  The effects are not well done at all  If they were that would be a different story,6
79396,2361번,Sharknado,8,I hate this movie sooooooooooooooooooooooooo much I love it   Amazing  So funny  With the scene with the school bus look at the name on the side of the bus,4
79397,2361번,Sharknado,8,My ratingNC17 for extreme goreextreme bloodextreme violenceand some sexual content,1
79608,2366번,Shazam!,8,good movie one of dcs best,1
79609,2366번,Shazam!,8,watch with friends and family,1
79610,2366번,Shazam!,8,Shazam is great Ive seen the movie so many times and each time I love it just the same  Newcomers and fans of the DCEU will have loads to appreciate and the movie is certainly more entertaining for families  However the film is a bit more dark and scary than parents may have anticipated,5
79611,2366번,Shazam!,8,this movie is pretty darn tame compared to something like suicide squad  yet kids still watched that people are overreacting its a good movie,3
79612,2366번,Shazam!,8,Shazam is a DC film about a boy named Billy who keeps on running away from foster care in search of his birth mom  Billy is then put into another home where he meets his halfbrotherbest friend Freddy  He later meets a wizard who grants him powers by just saying one word Shazam Parents might want to be aware that there is moderate violence in this film including a very distressing scene where a boy cant find his mum and gets lost in the crowd  Luckily police help him  A mans eye contains the seven sins which could easily disturb younger children  A seventh sin bites a mans head off and throws him out a window  No blood  The villain could scare some viewers  A monster attacks a guy in a wheelchair as the doors close  Shazam is thrown onto a car and he has blood on his nose  In addition to violence look out for some moderate coarse language including s t middle finger gestures d k a man swears on TV but it is bleeped out and easy to tell he was saying f k  No sex in this movie but Billy drinks some beer and quickly spits it out  This should be fine for kids 10,13
79613,2366번,Shazam!,8,This is by far the best DCEU film to come out since Wonder Woman  Although not as dark as Wonder Woman this movie does has it darker moments  Some scenes that has violence in it may seem too shocking since some of it comes out of nowhere  But it keeps a wonderful light hearted tone with some emotional elements in the film too  Zachery Levi was comedy gold in this film and definitely stole the show  The other actors as well particularly Darla the little girl definitely didnt be reduced to the cutting room floor and had enough screen time  Most if not all the humor stuck the landing for me and even the heartwarming moments worked SO well for me and didnt seem too melodramatic  Zachery Levi and Mark Strong had excellent classic super hero vs bad guy chemistry and didnt seem too forced  Even the pacing didnt drag despite being around 2 hours  This is everything I wanted from a DCEU film and more  I would give Shazam A 90100,12
79614,2366번,Shazam!,8,This movie is so good It has hilarious jokes and touching scenes  I loved it so much,3
80093,2384번,Shrek,8,I personally love the movie along with thousands of other people who had the blessing of seeing the classic movie but there is a bit of cussing and inside jokes that some people might understand  Most kids at the age of 8 has at least heard swearing somewhere before so thats why I think 8 is the appropriate age to see Shrek  Children learn about puberty somewhere around the age of 8 so I think its safe to say that it is an appropriate age to see Shrek,3

80097,2384번,Shrek,8,Shrek Is an Amazing Movie I have always loved this movie and the whole series in general this movie still is funny till this day  Eddie murphy as Donkey is so fun to be around in this movie also Shrek Is so Good The best he has ever been Lord Farquad is a believable villain All the performances is good also all of them are not much to say such a classic to Watch I Give Shrek An A,1
80098,2384번,Shrek,8,preceding the middling Shrek The Third  the fan favorite Shrek 2 and my personal favorite Shrek Forever After,1
80099,2384번,Shrek,8,I saw this movie when I was 8 it was on Cartoon Network though never watched the whole entire thing I noticed something inappropriate for a kids film  A PG Rating but well but before that I never heard those until I noticed one  then I watched a video of the cursing scenes with occasional Mild profanity as its used a whole lot While the violence or anything inappropriate isnt too much the Language is im giving this a PG13 Rating Due to The Language,1
80100,2384번,Shrek,8,I loved this and still do  Great movie,2
80101,2384번,Shrek,8,Its fine but    Theres a bit of swearing but there great messages and role modles  So i would belive this is for kids age 11 and up,2
80164,2384번,Shrek,7,When I first watched this film I was a year old and my parents say I used to love it  I would watch shrek 3 times a day inless they had to go out  My parents couldnt believe it  Thats probably why they told me,4
80165,2384번,Shrek,7,While simultaneously embracing and subverting fairy tales the irreverent Shrek also manages to tweak Disneys nose provide a moral message to children and offer viewers a funny fastpaced ride,1
80166,2384번,Shrek,7,this movie was made before i was born but i still love it but also be warned that there is a lot of mild swearing for a kids movie but kids probably wont understand it,1
80167,2384번,Shrek,7,I didnt see this movie when I was young unlike most other kids  And ive just recently watched it  I still found many scenes funny as the jokes appeal to almost every age  Unlike that garbage movie Alvin and the chipmunks,4
80168,2384번,Shrek,7,Has great messages and a satisfying story,1
80169,2384번,Shrek,7,I thought that Shrek had a great story and was well written  However there are uses of ass damn and hell  Also Princess Fiona shows a bit of cleavage  Nothing too concerning but heads up for parents,4
80170,2384번,Shrek,7,I know I watched this a lot when I was little and I watched it on long road trips but I just watched it again with my little brother age 5 and I am starting to notice this movie has multiple adult jokes for older kids  Again I didnt remember anything from when I was younger so it should go over their heads  Swears said damn as crap jackas kissas stupid  and a line said keep your feet of the grass wash your hands wipe your face and another line that people keep reporting but I am 11 and I still dont understand so    Its fine  For violence there is a fire breathing dragon knights fighting and more fighting not graphic its pretty funny and I wouldnt worry too much,5
80171,2384번,Shrek,7,Shrek is a sweetfunny film for all of the family  Donkey is very funny and has some good jokes and all the characters have strong personalities  This film has themes of inner beauty and acceptance  Overall it is a lot fun and I would recommend it for kids,4
80172,2384번,Shrek,7,MOVIE INFO,1
80173,2384번,Shrek,7,Dont let your little one watch this movie unless you want you kids saying bad words that I dont care to repeat   But other then that its a really good movie,2
80574,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,This is my favorite movie of all time  There is just one number that you shouldnt show your young kids  Its called Make em Laugh  Cosmo Brown is just flipping off walls which might make your kid hurt themselves trying to do it  Other than that its a great movie that you should watch,5
80575,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,I enjoyed the movie Singin In The Rain it was a comical movie  My favorite character was Cosmo he had a lot of funny moments  I think that kids will love to watch this movie because of how funny it is  My one favorite song was Make Em Laugh by Cosmo,4
80576,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,I think that this is a good classic movie  Considering that it is a musical with catchy musicI didnt think that there was too much singing in it  The story wasnt to complex but I still enjoyed watching the movie,3
80577,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,A definite classic There is a lot of kissing and a whole lot of singing  Many parts show behind the scenes of making a movie in the silent era  When they are approached with movies with audio they need to get in position  It shows what is needed for a show to go on with some what I would call unnecessary singing,5
80578,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,This movie is great  For a G rating it does have some smoking kissing and some comical violence in the Make Em Laugh scene but not any other bad stuff,3
80579,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,A classic for the Whole Family that is just great,1
80580,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,Singin in the Rain is a wonderful classic musical for the whole family  There are several kisses and champagne and cigars are shown  Also there are some suggestive outfits for only a few shots though  The worst the language gets is dumb and dope  An aweinspiring soundtrack and a whimsical storyline make this musical about American stardom in the 1920s a fantastic film everyone is sure to love,5
80581,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,Singin in the Rain has countless times been named the greatest musical ever made and of course there are many reasons for this all of its songs are memorable it features the most iconic songanddance routine in film history and it celebrates talent creativity and imagination  Some of the comic elements in the film may be too sophisticated for children under 10 but the music is universal and the main focus of the film anyway  A loving tribute to Hollywood and its fickleness there are some selfcentred manipulative characters and passionate romantic moments to stay aware of,3
80582,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,Love it love it love it love it love it  Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooove IT,2
80583,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,CSM doesnt always include everything  Did nobody notice that Olgas dressed inappropriatelyShes only shown in two scenes  Also this girl on a poster isnt dressed appropriately  Thats only one 10 second scene  I love Lina Also Don and Kathy kiss 2 times but thats all  Also Lina says 2 insults dope and dumb,8
80996,2421번,Smallfoot,7,I think this movie is the best for 5 year olds its not as bad as u think it is,1
80997,2421번,Smallfoot,7,Small Foot is just a masterpiece  Its really adorable as well definetly would recommend if your into fictional creatures,3
80998,2421번,Smallfoot,7,I thought the music was great and the movie was really cute   I would watch it 3 more times,2
80999,2421번,Smallfoot,7,This was a fun family movie The musical numbers were great and it had a very solid storyline  I found it very entertaining and fun,3
81000,2421번,Smallfoot,7,It is very funny and interesting and also sad  It is fineso the parents can watch it with there kids,1
81001,2421번,Smallfoot,7,I will admit it was better than I expected  Really good for a kids movie funny and cute although a little predictable and silly  Music was soso  In no way did it come off antireligious to me a religious teen  Totally worth the watch for a fun family movie night,5
81002,2421번,Smallfoot,7,My 160000000 year old cranked that Zendata managing the data in movies to be less effective  Excuse me I think gothic teens will might be bored P Okay I will capture the Bigfoot in the 1970s instead ZendayaRants,4
81003,2421번,Smallfoot,7,An unbelievably great movie a list of laughs a mile long,1
81004,2421번,Smallfoot,7,Smallfoot is a good movie that you can watch with friends or family no violence or scary scenes there is about two or three sad parts in it and one part with tranquilizers but aside from that the movie is fun and it will not give any children nightmares the next night hopefully so do not be worried if they say they will be scared if they watch it,1
81206,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,Song of the Sea is a beautifully told story  although the film is based around a little boy who is cruel to his sister and some parts include strange creatures that might make younger kids scared it is a great family movie  the animation is incredible and will be very inspiring to young artists,3
81207,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,This is a movie that is worth rewatching again and again  I say that it is for ages six and up because anyone younger would not appreciate it but it is appropriate for all ages,2
81208,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,I loved this movie  The graphics and story were beautiful  I strongly recommend watching it,3
81209,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,its so cute and extremely good just a little creepy though,1
81210,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,Violance some mild peril  In the beginning the audience is left to believe that a woman died  A boy gets almost hit by a car but the act is possibly played for laughs  An antagonists animals tries to take a child but is protected by other characters and the characters turns to stone by the animals but the child is safe and leaves  Sexy stuff a wife kisses her husband brief  Profanity Ben makes several religious exclaminations like holy molly and Jesus Maria and Josef feic off is written on a door but i didnt know what it meant and other children would probably not focus on that  Drinkingdrugssmoking Conor drinks at a pub in one scene brief which seems to be a habit for him since grandma said something like where were you drinking at the pub no other reference of pub drinking is made  Personally i think younger kids can watch it for the beautiful animation and soundtrack but the story might go over younger kids heads  But the csms age rating is still understandable  a girl goes down to the sea at night alone and swims in one scene Ben and maybe even Saorises goal is to go from the city back to the lighthouse without supervision for the major part of the movie a characters body slowly changesages the characters hair turns white and the body gets weaker  Overall a lovely movie that i recommend,14
81211,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,Okay not to be rude or anything but the Song Of The Sea is a odd movie  The Song Of The Sea is about An Irish youth discovers that his mute sister is a selkie  A half human half seal   Who must find her voice and free supernatural creatures from the spell of a Celtic goddess  So the whole movie is hand drawn which makes all of them look creepy  Then the music is sooo weird  And not to mention the mom abandoned her family to go with the selkie pod It was confusing depressing and just plain weird  I think it might be super popular in Ireland  I just didnt think it was all that good,9
81212,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,scary great role  models but its good and you might  need to go past some parts,1
81213,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,I think that this movie is very good but is a little sad  I would definitely watch this again  The drawings and sound are incredible  Very good,4
81214,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,This movie is really great  It is very complex and I had a hard time understanding the story but the imagery in this movie is unbelievable  I would not recommend this for younger children as the story is very complex and the plot deals with a heavy subject,3
81215,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,I liked the Song of the Sea  It was grate and a litel scarey but other than that it was good,2
81351,2446번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,In the movie it says hell and almost said son of a b,1
81352,2446번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,Its a good movie i dont have anything else to say,1
81353,2446번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,This movie has a lot of stuff,1
81354,2446번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,The movie was exciting and if you liked sonic or not you would like it a lot it had good mix of scenes and makes the viewer intrigued on the movie and I think it would be for kids 9 but it does have a bit of violence so if you dont like violence you might not like it as much and overall it was a good movie,1
81355,2446번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,Plot Sonic is alone on planet earth after fleeing from a tribe that tried to capture him as a child  When the government discovers Sonic they hire Dr  Robotnik Jim Carrey to track him down  Sonic acquires the help of his friend Tom James Marsden to help him get back to his home planet,3
81356,2446번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,I liked it  Some unfinished cursing  Quite good,3
81357,2446번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,fantastic it had a lot of good things and it was a little good and a little good but if you take one good away it is terrible  Scientificly people think that this movie is good the end,2
81358,2446번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,Parents need to know that this film is really good  James Marsden plays a character very similar to his in Hop which could confuse younger viewers  There is a lot of perilaction  In one scene someone drinks  There is lots of positive messages and role models  Some cutoff swearing like son of a  and what the   Lots of consumerism  The whole movie is an avritisement for the video game,8
81819,2461번,Spaceballs,6,I found the humor rather boring and bad a lot of random swearing and such  Wouldnt recommend at all but defiantly not for kids under 13,2
81820,2461번,Spaceballs,6,There is lots of swear words as well as groin related jokes however if your kids are mature enough to no whats not appropriate and what is as well as if your okay maybe covering your kids eyes in a couple of seams  But other then that its a great movie that well leave you laughing,2
81821,2461번,Spaceballs,6,Spaceballs is a 1987 comedy movie directed by Mel Brooks and starring Rick Moranis Bill Pullman Mel Brooks John Candy and Daphne Zuniga,1
81822,2461번,Spaceballs,6,This is a decent comedy spoof  It is funny and interesting to see how the original Star Wars characters are portrayed in this parody  The movie has some mild innuendo and a good amount of language including fck once sht and asshole  Its laughoutloud hilarious but its only a 3 star movie,4
81823,2461번,Spaceballs,6,this is the best mel brooks move  is is much funny,2
81824,2461번,Spaceballs,6,This is a good movie but more for the older audience,1
81825,2461번,Spaceballs,6,This spoof on classic sciencefiction movies can be very dumb and wacky but thats what makes it so unique  The humor used throughout has very wacky concepts to it but yet these concepts are very innovative when used and are able to effectively satirize Star Wars Alien and more with successful results,2
81826,2461번,Spaceballs,6,Spaceballs is a great Mel Brooks comedy with a laugh in a minute guarantee by all of the comedy lovers,1
81827,2461번,Spaceballs,6,Spaceballs is actually the first spoof movie I ever saw and it was very funny and in a creative way  Sure some of the humor is predictable but all of the humor is very creative  Mel Brooks has created humor that NO ONE has ever thought of doing  Like when Dark Helmet accidentally hits a cameraman with his Schwartz it is very creative and hilarious  Mel Brooks Rick Moranis John Candy and Bill Pullman were perfect for their roles and gave me something to laugh at several times throughout the movie  However it gets pretty dirty halfway through,6
82023,2471번,Spider-Man 2,8,Before no way home I have decided watching all of the spider man movies  AS I SAJD BEFOFE I BARELY remember this series so I went in this expecting a great experience and it was good,2
82024,2471번,Spider-Man 2,8,has stilzied actionviolence,1
82025,2471번,Spider-Man 2,8,CinematographyVisuals 45,1
82026,2471번,Spider-Man 2,8,Its a fine movie and has a good villain  Its not as violent as the first movie,2
82027,2471번,Spider-Man 2,8,I watched SpiderMan 2 back when I was probably 4 or 5  I remember the losing powers scene and just how good of a movie it was  But going back to the movie 8 years later just shows how harsh it actually is  Let me give you a brief idea of what I think is harsh in this movie  Let me know what you think,5
82028,2471번,Spider-Man 2,8,I love this movie but it is violent and has long kissing scenes,1
82029,2471번,Spider-Man 2,8,How is this ok for kids The wife sees a pane of glass hurtling towards her the entire emergency room staff are gutted  We stopped watching when the grandmother was dropped offa building  Not ok for kids,4
82030,2471번,Spider-Man 2,8,Wow spider man 2 is the best spider man movie ever it was amazing I watched this movie when I was 7 and I loved it doc ock is a great villain the actors are amazing cgi was great for the time cgi still holds up kinda and I totally recommend this movie but if this is your kids 1st pg13 movie then I would go for spider man homecoming then this movie,1
82031,2471번,Spider-Man 2,8,The only scene that you have to worry about is the medic scene its not scary its very violent for young kids and the concept of it is scary,1
82032,2471번,Spider-Man 2,8,Not for younger kids but for older kid teens and tweens perfect  SpiderMan 2 is one of my favorite movies,2
82179,2472번,Spider-Man 3,8,SpiderMan  3 may not not be the best of the series but it  is still really good and is a enjoyable  actionpacked blockbuster that you wont  wanna miss,1
82180,2472번,Spider-Man 3,8,This movie has too much violence  It gave me nightmares  I had a nightmare of a character named Venom  I think this movie should be rated R for intense action violence,4
82181,2472번,Spider-Man 3,8,The only reason why this movie gets so much hate is because the critics werent having it  It truly is spectacular how movie critics can sway the popular opinion surrounding a movie as great as SpiderMan 3  After overcoming various obstacles in the previous two movies Peter Parker SpiderMan is in the prime of his life  Hes with the girl of his dreams the city of New York loves him and hes just been given the key to the city  Peter eventually lets his pride get to him and he becomes oblivious to the troubles that those closest to him are facing  This lack of selfawareness leads to the untimely breakup between him and MJ and makes him susceptible to the symbiote suit which latches on to him halfway through the movie  This event gives rise to the black suited SpiderMan and consequently a cockier and even more oblivious emostyled Peter Parker  In exchange for enhanced powers and confidence Peter gives his humanity and kindness which made him who he was in the previous two movies  His newfound ferocious nature leads him to ferociously beatdown on Sandman and after believing that he has killed him Peter returns to his apartment   After a dispute with his beloved landlord Mr  Ditkovich Peter realizes that the black suit is bad for him and promptly puts it away  Mr  Ditkovich then helps Peter out by giving him some advice on how to flirt with MJ which includes the famous lines You are good woman I am good man  From then on the movie becomes all the more actionpacked leading to a thrilling climax at the end where Peter teams up with Harry to fight both Sandman and Venom  Would recommend to all buy this movie and show it to your kids,13
82182,2472번,Spider-Man 3,8,SpiderMan 3 is a good movie  Its still a competent addition to the Raimi Trilogy but its undoubtedly the worst in it  I used to really like this movie but upon rewatching it my opinion changed  I still had fun with it but there was a lot of bad parts in the movie probably more so than good parts  The characters seem pretty different from the first two and the story is so rushed that its hard to get invested in this film,5
82183,2472번,Spider-Man 3,8,This was personally my favorite of the three spiderman movies its theme was a little more mature than the other two spiderman aka peter parker almost goes evil in one section of the movie and it might be upsetting for kids when harry tries to kill peter in the end  But peter fights the temptation of becoming evil,2
82184,2472번,Spider-Man 3,8,Okay great movie  It has three villains Hobgoblin Venom and Sandman  I dont know what they were thinking with including Hobgoblin and Venom  They let Hobgoblin get a good play in the end but Venom No  It was nice to have Venom as a sidevillain but they did a great job with Sandman,6
82185,2472번,Spider-Man 3,8,Probably the best of the three this movie is quite a bit more intense than the first two if your kid was a little scared of the first two wait until heshe is 8,1
82186,2472번,Spider-Man 3,8,Parents need to know that this is the third film in the SpiderMan franchise  It has lots of violence  Peter has some scary nightmares  Peter is really mean in some scenes and strikes someone he loves  SPOILER ALERT Many important characters die including one character who is a minor villain but a main character as well as a main character from the other two films That one is really sad  Lots of I am going to mary someone else or I will date your girlfriend kind of thing  Good Movie  The evil goo might scare younger viewers,8
82187,2472번,Spider-Man 3,8,there is so much stabbing not so much cursing though if a kid under 8 watched it they would get nightmares,1
82600,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,Pros Plot was nice there was a lot of humor and it teaches nice lessons like unity and friendship  Also good animation,2
82601,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,More for younger kids,1
82602,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,Im a very simple girl  I instantly love almost everything at watchread  But this This has gotta be the first piece of media excluding music  that has weirded me out  And even then I rate it 3 stars  Anyways as for anything parents should be concerned about,6
82603,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH His hand shrinks,2
82604,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,When I watched this I expected something funny or sad or something but I got garbage  It has enough potty humor and nude scenes to make a five year old laugh for days  There were no surprises or anything that would shock the viewer so dont waste your time with it,3
82605,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,Theres nothing really inappropriate in spies in disguise  There is a scene with a naked man but you cant see anything to bad  you do see his butt very clearly but besides that theres no bad nudity  There is a normal amount of violence for a animated kids actioncomedy movie   As usual theres gross jokes and humor that will entertain a 58  That pretty much raps up my review the sad thing is that they had so much potential with this movie and they did nothing with it such talented voice actors to really a shame,6
82606,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,Super good it funny and surprising you should watch this your kids will love it,1
82607,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,Fun movie with nice story   Some parents comments are exagerated  This is a nice fun movie to watch,3
82617,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,Spies in Disguise is a great movie  It is a funny movie and a little sad  It is a great adventure story Wilbur is a great role model,4
82618,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,not funny but super funny haha i loved it,1
82619,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,I have seen on here that some parents are leaving reviews of 18 Like really This is such an awesome movie How is it disgusting It has a picked on nerdy kid who saves the day And plus it is unlikely friends that do it together It is a kids movie and the naked parts arent even that bad for you to be covering your kids eyes And those who are saying the boy said Fifty Shades of Yeah how is that bad if I may ask It is not like he is saying Fifty Shades of Grey  There are some dramatic people out there that dont deserve to write reviews on here  It is just made to be funny especially for kids If you say you wasted your money maybe you should have read the reviews and then maybe considered instead of just watching the movie and leaving a horrible an overexaggerated review Very disappointed in some of these reviews ugh,14
82620,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,I love this film I think it should be a TV show,2
82621,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,It was meh Tom Holland is always great but there were moments that were a bit cringe  They had some millennial memes under disguise there was a scene of nudity that was uncomfortable oh god dont get me started on the sumo thing  It just made me and the very very Christian homeschool girl Im friends with super uncomfortable,3
82622,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,Spies in disguise is a great movie in almost every way  Will Smith and Tom Holland knock it out of the park with voice acting it has detailed animation it is hilarious and it might just be one of my favorite movies  Expect some more mature themes though  Lots of violence and people dying not on screen but implied many moments where characters almost swear and there is some drinking  This movie is a must watch please watch it,5
82623,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,I think this movie is very very funny but there is a scary when the guy shows his robot self,1
82624,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,Great movie with lots of jokes  Love the cast not a lot of bad stuff,2
82625,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,best family film ever,1
82626,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,This movie    supercalafragilisticexpialodocious I loved this movie I thought it was just stunning The animation the storyline    But there is violence like kicking punching spy stuff  Mild language such as hell heck and the fword but it is beeped out,7
82627,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,This movie is very   funny,1
82628,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,Great movie with Will Smith and Tom Holland,2
82629,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,This is so awesome,1
82630,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,Scene where some male figure shows nudity  almost to the point of revealing the male gentalia      I was disgusted and couldnt believe the detail in art work that was sexually explicit   The f was bleeped and totally unnecessary  why pretend to use a cuss word as a bleep  it was annoying   just filth in my opinion   The majority of the humor is towards a younger age audience but the scenes I mentioned just took away from the humor and makes this a movie not a great pick for kids    I told my mom not to let my younger siblings watch it,5
82631,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,Although Spies in Disguise is a very comedic movie with great voice actors it has lots of violent scenes that make you say Ouch or Oooo out loud while watching the movie  My parents really enjoyed Spies in Disguise so I guess there are mixed feeling about it but every movie has different people watching it w opinions right If you are looking for a very funny kids spy movie and you dont care about watching some characters battle it out then this movie should be your top pick,5
82632,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,it is hilarious but when there in kamoras apartmant they say hands up and see kamoras butt little kids find it funny though,1
82633,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,I am 14 years old and I watched it with my family and enjoyed it nd laughed  This Animation is suitable for all ages and i totally recommend,2
82634,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,Its very good  its really funny  It has potty humor and has some peril but overall has great messages and roll models,3
82635,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,Parents need to know that this movie is very good,1
82739,2477번,Spirited Away,7,i love all the Japanese films from studio ghilbi and this was one of my favorites  the beautiful animation and characters are a masterpiece and the story is amazing  though the movie is beautifully done some scenes are bloody and violent,3
82740,2477번,Spirited Away,7,This is a really good movie Its about a girl whos parents are turned into pigs  She tries to find them but there a lot of other things that she has to do  This movie can be creepy but not too creepy  However there are a few scary parts so if you have a child who gets scared easilythis movie might not be great for them,5
82741,2477번,Spirited Away,7,i think its a wonderfull movie but maybe a little of a lot of violence,1
82742,2477번,Spirited Away,7,Beautiful movie cool story but can be scary when a dragon gets hurt and is bleeding all over the place,1
82743,2477번,Spirited Away,7,This is my absolute favorite movie of all time However I would NOT recommend this for children under the age of 10 or children that get creeped out easily  There are several extremely disturbing characters such as No Face a spirit that goes crazy and eats people  His appearance may also be frightening to some viewers  The parents turn into giant pigs at the beginning which could also frighten children  However the 10yearold main character is very brave and goes through lots of solid character development throughout the movie she goes from being bratty and lazy to being brave and kind and the one of the themes that I personally took from the movie was kindness,6
82744,2477번,Spirited Away,7,It may be a little bit creepy for younger children but i LOVE IT  There is a few parts like a frog smoking the babys butt is not covered  a boy in dragon form getting attacked by paper birds and bleeding and throwing up blood and almost bleeding to death and a creature named Noface luring people with gold and eating them  I have no idea how 7 year olds could be scared by this  Just make sure that your child is mature enough to not be scared by ghosts and things  Just know that this is 5 stars,5
82745,2477번,Spirited Away,7,Yes Princess Mononoke is good Howls moving castle is good  But they do not come close to this film  Spirited away is a great movie  I think ages 10 will really enjoy it   There is nothing bad in it although when No face becomes crazy and starts to eat people that might scare some younger kids but it is not too bad,5
82746,2477번,Spirited Away,7,Spirited Away is a beautiful movie one that makes you immediately want to watch it again  The soundtrack is lovely  the characters are all memorable and likable even the bad guys and visually the movie is stunning,2
82747,2477번,Spirited Away,7,I am 7 years old and I have watched spirited away  For me it is  6 and up  But I can see how other people may not  like it and be scared of it  SUPER AWSOME AND EXCITING,4
83019,2485번,Spy Kids,7,Just the right combination of fantasy and comedy,1
83020,2485번,Spy Kids,7,VIOLENCE SCARINESS AND GORE  People are turned into mutant creatures for a kids TV show in the movie  The show also has a lot of fingers designed to look like humans  Might creep kids out  No blood,4
83021,2485번,Spy Kids,7,Exciting familyfriendly tale with some violence peril,1
83022,2485번,Spy Kids,7,Pretty solid film but there is one scene where the mom of the kids whispers into the dads ear to persuade him  This is a bit sexual,2
83023,2485번,Spy Kids,7,This movie is very boring and bad  The sister character is annoying and unlikable  This is one of the most overrated and boring movies Ive ever seen,3
83024,2485번,Spy Kids,7,AMAZING film but bewarned of one almost 4 letter word,1
83025,2485번,Spy Kids,7,Spy Kids was my favorite movie as a kid and I still love it today  I used to watch it all the time when I was younger  This movie has a lot of great role models  Yes its a little stupid but overall it was very ahead of its time  It has good representation strong female leads Hispanic family a good plot and its enjoyable to watch  I strongly recommend this movie for all ages  Some younger kids could be startled by the fooglies and they could not understand the plot,7
83026,2485번,Spy Kids,7,GREAT  Six year olds can really enjoy this amazing film  Even the grown up spies are GREAT  Yeah suitable for six and over,4
83283,2491번,Stand by Me,7,THIS WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS  Stand by me is a sweet movie about four 12 year olds go on a quest to search for a dead body  A ton of strong language is used  It is one of my favorite movies  My favorite kid is teddy  I would rather let kids watch this then disney crap  While the boys search another group and up beating the boys to the body   Gordy pulls out a gun  None of the groups take this body  Later the body if found and neither of the groups is given credit  Amazing movie with awesome ,11
83284,2491번,Stand by Me,7,This movie follows four best friends going on possibly their last adventure together  There is quite a lot of cussing  But as Wil Wheaton said Parents who think their kids dont cuss are just fooling themselves  This movie is amazing and perfect for growing teens  I would recommend to anyone who cares to see it,5
83285,2491번,Stand by Me,7,This is an example of a rating completely baffling me  If this didnt have the F bombs and smoking it would be PG  I actually encourage you to show any kid 6 and up this movie its rated so unfairly  Realistic language that 12 year old boys actually speak I should know  A few kids smoke cigarettes but if your kid has seen someone smoke in real life its no different  Wheres your kid going to get cigarettes anyway A few kids talk about tits again like we actually do in real life  At the end a dead body is seen not too graphic a little blood  The movie has great messages behind it like friendship and loyalty and even just doing the right thing  The main character is a great role model except for the smoking,10
83286,2491번,Stand by Me,7,people die and kids do drugs but still one of the best,1
83287,2491번,Stand by Me,7,This is a fantastic movie  Ive seen this countless times since I was around 8  I have two younger siblings whom have grown up watching it  While there is plenty of swearing some smoking and it really evolves around a search for a murdered body I really think that the overall message of friendship and loyalty hence the name Stand By Me over powers it all  And yes there are sexual innuendos like most shows and movies these days  They will fly over the younger audiences heads  I really think that if your child has been exposed to any media violence and rough language this movie is fine for them to watch,7
83288,2491번,Stand by Me,7,Great movie  I watched it when I was 10 first R rated movie  It has strong lenguge 11f words 110 uses of py 1 use ck possibly 1 use of ct  This also has four 12 year old boys talk about sexual stuff boobsetc eight 18 year old boys talk about getting laid  12 year olds carry around around a 45 caliber  Very intense but still if your kid has played gta4or5 they will love this movie,5
83289,2491번,Stand by Me,7,The movie is funny clever depressing adventurous and chilling all at the same time  Dont let the R rating put you away from the film  There is some strong language but there are lots of positive messages of growing up strong with others  A great classic,4
83290,2491번,Stand by Me,7,stand by me is a great moviebut has a lot of language and smoking,1
83291,2491번,Stand by Me,7,I think this is completely okay for early teens   As far as the language goes thats what 12 and 13 yr olds actually talk like   There are some references to  child abuse both physical and emotional but its not bad at all   Stand By Me is the perfect movie for teens,4
83292,2491번,Stand by Me,7,Its a great movie about 4 boys who act older as their adventure goes on Interesting movie about how kids grow up and become teenagers,1
83364,2494번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,I didnt think this series could get any better but it does This movie kind of shows up the previous one but the first one sets up nicely for this one,2
83365,2494번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,Star Trek Into Darkness is a 2013 scifi movie directed by J  J  Abrams and starring Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Benedict Cumberbatch Alice Eve Simon Pegg and Leonard Nimoy,1
83366,2494번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,JJ Abrams is a good director  His best attributes have to be his attention to detail intricacies in characters and intense suspense,2
83367,2494번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,Overall this movie is very good  At the discretion of parents I would not allow a kid to watch this movie until they are AT LEAST 14,2
83368,2494번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,This film has a lot of violence and is very intense  There is strong punching kick shooting stabbing and more  On one bit a guy crushes a mans head and stamps on a whoman lying on the floor  She then has to go to hospital meaning it was A bad injury  On one fight scene there is very strong violence and a man gets his neck snapped  They are also being continuously punched and being slammed against walls  It is very stressful and intense  There is bad language used very often including bloody bastard bitch shit ass crap damn and more  The language is not as bad as the first one because that one has an F bomb at the beginning  Going back to the violence there is some blood  Whomen are shown in bed topless with men and there is lots of underwear  For mature 10 year olds or 11 year olds  There is great messages and role model as the captain dies to save his crew  Spoiler alert   he comes back to life  Also enemies become friends in the film  There is also drinking at a bar,16
83369,2494번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,Omagersh this movie was absolutely terrible The plot was really only for a gasp for the audience  They were more concerned with the gasp than the Wow  That was really interesting Its certainly making me think,5
83370,2494번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,Amazing movie  I think the storyline is amazing and the acting is superb  J J Abrams did an amazing job on this film if it even is a little bit violent I think little kids may not like this movie as it is a bit scary for their age group Their is a few st  and a word very close to the Fword  This 2 and a half hour movie is great and definitely worth your time,4
83371,2494번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,This was a an excellent second movie It was not disappointing at all There were some creepy parts but they really werent too bad Overall it is a fantastic movie to watch  ,5
83372,2494번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,My rating hard PG13 for graphic nudity racy content language and some bloody violence,1
83639,2511번,Steve Jobs,8,great,1
83640,2511번,Steve Jobs,8,I am a Apple Fan and I honestly love this movie  It tells about how we got the device that we know and love today  However try watching it together if you have a 67 year old as it does contain some language,3
83641,2511번,Steve Jobs,8,Why is everyone making a huge deal about the appropriateness of this movie Its literally just swearing  And Ive heard WAY more swearing in other movies  By age 8 Id heard all these words before  Its not like kids will watch this movie and suddenly start cussing At one point Jobs asks his assistant Why havent we slept together which is the only reference to sex in the entire movie,7
83642,2511번,Steve Jobs,8,I think the format of this movie is really interesting  When I started to watch it I thought it was going to be like every other biopic but I actually found it very engaging I also think the casting is great especially Michael Fassbender,3
83643,2511번,Steve Jobs,8,There is no other film with such perfect timing and dialogue  An overwhelming sense of emotion is tirelessly infused within the script  The acting portrays not just the characters but human stories that all can relate with  The music is a collision much like Jobs of creativity yet also pause  This film is a miracle,5
83644,2511번,Steve Jobs,8,A TON OF UNNECESSARY CUSSING Buuuuuut if your kid can handle it its ok  I watched it because my dad worshiped him lol  It was a good educational movie,4
83645,2511번,Steve Jobs,8,Michael Fassbenders portrayal and Danny Boyles direction really shine here as both of them show brilliant roles in their part   Aron Sorkins dialogue also is amazing  Also the cinematography is brilliant and was amazing to see that in the first act a 16 mil lens was used than a 18 mil lens in the second act ans then was shot on digital cameras to show the progression of technology,3
83646,2511번,Steve Jobs,8,This was a really interesting movie because it  didnt have any plot at all  it was basically just Steve Jobs launching three different products with no flashbacks showing you his past life or careers at all  Whether youre intrigued or utterly confused at that type of filmmaking is a matter of personal opinion  However what is NOT a matter of personal opinion is the frequent usage of strong language such as fk st ahole and the like  Also something that CSM didnt cover which is part of the reason Im writing this review is that a Time magazine interview in which Steve Jobs joked that 28 of American men slept with his wife and therefore produced his daughter which later comes back at him is referenced a lot especially towards the beginning  Overall the film isnt that bad contentwise especially for an Rrated movie and is appropriate for teens to see if it holds their interest that is  My MPAA rating R for language,7
83647,2511번,Steve Jobs,8,Though this is my favorite movie The Language has some dmns,1

86632,2574번,Tarzan,6,Well honestly this seems a perfect movie for a five year old  For a G movie its violent for little ones because,2
86633,2574번,Tarzan,6,I was really dissapointed  Women shouldnt be showing of their elbows all the time  Its disgusting  A woman should be modest  My 10 year old son couldnt stop ogling those elbows  It was awful,6
86634,2574번,Tarzan,6,It is rated G and a great movie,1
86635,2574번,Tarzan,6,This movie is kind of good  Kids will love this Disneycartoon movie  This movie is kind of funny and has humor  Though this movie is kind of intense  Shooting is involve  There is some brief cruleness  Mild sex is involve,7
86636,2574번,Tarzan,6,Good example of a golden age Disney movie,1
86637,2574번,Tarzan,6,I just want to say there is SO much death in this movie First Tarzans parents are unceremoniously eaten by a leopard within the first five minutes and you can see bloody pawprints surrounding them  Then a little baby gorilla is out with his family and he chases a butterfly away from his parents  Were all thinking Aww what a little cutie maybe this will be a sweet movie after all And then the leopard comes  The father gorilla knows they wont be able to save the baby so he holds the mother gorilla back  The poor little baby gorilla is eaten by the leopard offscreen but you can still hear the poor thing screaming in pain and the mother gorilla just hides her face against her husbandmate and cries  Then at the end of the movie the alpha gorilla is shot and killed leaving poor Tarzan heartbroken but in charge of the gorilla troop  And then in the worst Disney death EVER the hunter guy gah I cant remember his name    gets tangled in vines and tries to cut himself free  Little does he know there is a vine entwined around his neck and he basically hangs himself by mistake  You see him plummeting and screaming and then the screen pans to Tarzans shocked face  Then a convenient little flash of lightning illuminates the villains dead body  I know that villains should be punished but that seems a bit far dont you think ANYWAYS the reason I gave three stars instead of one is that the plotline of Tarzan learning how to be human is really sweet and funny  Also I love the music especially Trashing the Camp EARWORM ALERT So if your kids can handle the gore and death I think this is a pretty good movie  Still I wish that not as many characters died  That kind of ruined it for me as I am very sensitive about that kind of thing   Im not saying I hate this movie  In fact I think its pretty good  I just get kind of upset whenever anyone dies  P S Watch Trashin the camp  Look at that teapot  ITS MRS  POTTS I freaked when I saw that  LOL,26
86638,2574번,Tarzan,6,This movie is very frightening but older kids 10 to 12 year olds will love it  In one scene Tarzan cuts open a leopard and Kerchacks death is very sad  There are some good messages like that characters can fit in even when they are from different places   Though most of the good messages are blocked out by guns there are still a few more like that you may get injured when saving your friends but it is worth it   Clayton is very scary   His actions involve killing a few gorillas   His death is very violent   Overall it is a good movie for tweens,8
86715,2580번,Teen Beach Movie,8,I saw the premiere at the beach then my sister watched over and over again it was a movie about Mack Maia Mitchell and Brady Ross Lynch I thought fallin for you was pretty catchy but I hated the rest of the movie I couldnt get past 30 minutes dont bother with this movie watch High School Musical if you like musicals and Disney channel,1
86716,2580번,Teen Beach Movie,8,I personally thought this movie was cute fun and enjoyable I really dont see how it can be considered inappropriate in any way there isnt even any kissing  The romance between Brady and Mac is so subtle that I didnt even realize that they were more than friends until they mentioned a possible breakup  And for the people complaining about the revealing swimwear they are at the beach What do you want them to wear full bodysuits The bathing suits are 60s fashion so I honestly think they are a lot more modest looking than current ones are and you can see nude colored material at certain points that the actresses are wearing under their costumes so nothing is revealed  For the love of god your child isnt going to become a sexcrazed demon because they saw a girls stomach  As for the plot itself there are definitely plot holes but none that really take away from the film  The whole mad scientist bit was just dumb and unnecessary and I think everyone else can agree with that as well  The cast was pretty good I dont really care that much for ross lynch I felt like I was watching the same exact character from Austin and Ally  Everyone else was great though There are tons of positive messages cliche ones like follow your dream and ones I was pleasantly surprised by there is more to life than trying to attract boys  The musical numbers were fun and catchy overplayed a bit in commercials but that shouldnt be a surprise  Overall I really think this movie is safe for young ones and fun for older kids too my brother is 10 and loves it,14
86717,2580번,Teen Beach Movie,8,This movie never appealed to me at all especially being an eleven yr  Old  The charachter cast and meager confusing storyline makes for a performance that is far below disneys usual standards,2
86718,2580번,Teen Beach Movie,8,This movie was HORRIBLE  It was corny and had no real humor  Love was basically directing this whole film if you know what I mean  But the cheesy kind of love  Just kissing and all that  It was just so bad,6
86719,2580번,Teen Beach Movie,8,It has a positive idea but is probably too childish for anyone over ten,1
86720,2580번,Teen Beach Movie,8,People keep saying that the movie is very inappropriatethey dont curse once there is no product placement and there is a great message  I mean sure there are bikinis and guys with their shirts off but do you want to take your family to the beach Well thats what youre gonna see  Kids arent gonna say I wanna be like Brady and take their shirts off  If you think kids are like sponges know that sponges dont take their shirts off,5
86721,2580번,Teen Beach Movie,8,This movie is terrible it has a bad soundtrack and a horrible story plot  so I go down in a wave and come back up in a 1950s movie seems pretty fun to me  NOT I would rather watch Baby Einstein for the rest of my life then Watch this movie again even though I only saw 30 minutes of it,4
86722,2580번,Teen Beach Movie,8,this is a dumb movie firstthis movie is so not about 60s n everything seems like now a lot of girl dress inapropriettall bootsshortsbikinis this movie is trying to make 60s look really modern and similar to todaybut its not like that watch west side story that movie talks about racisam n another social problems in the 60s and 70s i think kids need to know the truth about the 60s and disney always makes thing look betterherculessleeping beauty and another lies,1
86723,2580번,Teen Beach Movie,8,No matter what its about awesome movie ,2

86858,2585번,Teletubbies,8,Teletubbies is really annoying  It teaches kids how to speak gibberish and the babys face on the sun looks really weird and disturbing  Do not watch the show  Teletubbies face looks really disturbing as well  No educational value in it  Not even 1 bit,6
87213,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,The whirlwind animated adventure is a visual treat for tweens,1
87214,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,The Adventures of  Tintin has lots of adventure you guessed it and violence with pirates fighting some blood and lots of guns  Also the story is nice and ambiguous  Some may love this however what brings the movie rating down for me is that some scenes were too unreal and their was too much drinking  Once a pirate captain got directly hit by lightning but he was completely fine afterwards  Also the main character had been chased by pirates with guns at least ten times but did not get hit The worst part was probably where the drinking So much and even the dog got drunk This is way to unrealistic  Did I mention the dog is as smart as a human and seems to understand english,9
87215,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,Unless you are prepared to deal with nightmares or acts of pretend violence this movie is for you,1
87216,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,This movie is really fun I like it Its just a nice adventure movie to watch if you dont want to watch something emotional  TINTIN MY BELOVED   Great movie,5
87217,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,It is a good movie but they could have done it a little more entertaining,1
87218,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,this movie is great but there are tons of guns haddock is obsessed with alcohol and the blood on the newspaper seems really realistic for CGI,1
87219,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,I remember watching this for the first time back 2011 and being absolutely blown away by the visuals  The writing was a lot more mature but fun,2
87220,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,This is actually my favorite moviethough I am bit biased due to the fact that it was my childhood movie My parents didnt know that it was a more mature movie and brought me a long when I was 3   the action and violence flew over my head and I didnt really know what was happening  Though I was not scared by it I dont recommend that age After I grew older and learned to appreciate this movie I came to love it   I found the books and it made the movie even more of a treat  Tintin is a great role model and is the best Captain Haddocks drinking problem can not be ignored though  If you show it to kids you might want to inform about that and tell them it is bad  And if there is a child in the room you might want to tell them to close their eyes when the man is shot with a machine gun  Other than that the violence is mild with a few punches and missed gun shots,10
87221,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,This is pretty much appropriate for all ages as long as you skip through the violent scenes,1
87299,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,I say the violence only tentatively  Men get shot stabbed yet blood is only seen once  Most people hold gunsfire weapons  Haddock goes quite crazy after drinking and he drinks a lot  Tintin is quite intelligent resourceful and tough  Thompson and Thompson are humorous in that they are slightly reminiscent of the three stooges  An interesting point is that only one woman is seen in the whole movie  She is only secondary however  Also a startling point is that no children are present whatsoever  Tintin may look young but that premonition is quickly blown away,10
87300,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,I saw this movie when it came out in 3D this movie kept my intrest in this movie but my mom was kind of bored in some parts  so take your kids to see this movie it like indiana jones met pirates of the caribbean,2
87301,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,Like my title the books were way better trust me I know I have them all even the ones not released in the US like Tintin in the Congo  The movie is still good and is a must see for any Tintin fan  The Rating is PG which is solid but it is leaning to PG13 there is a man who gets shot partway into the movie and it shows him falling to the ground with some blood  Drinking is also a main theme in the movie but the positive rollmodels and the messages in the movie more then make up for the bad things age wise  This is a movie almost any age could see if they didnt mind some violence and a little blood  The humor is great  All in all a great movie for anyone,7
87302,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,When Nickelodeon Productions popped out of no where with the hit movie Rango I was baffled  It had a great mystery plot and best of all excellent CGI graphics  I loved it,3
87303,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,Steven Spielbergs long awaited and hotly anticipated new holiday movie One of two the other being War Horse which I have yet to see myself The adventures of Tintin is for all of the rave reviews and huge foreign and worldwide box office success and the long year of hype and anticipation thrown at Spielbergs feet it is just absolutely heartbreaking for me to report that I was greatly disappointing  And to add I have been a lifelong fan of the original Herge comics so I am not exactly very new to the whole Tintin franchise in the first place Tintin is very nice looking in fact it quiet possibly and very easily has by far the best use of motioncapture animation and computer animation technology that I have ever seen in any movie thus far  But that is the only good thing bout it  Tintin is a lifeless extremely long and almost interminably dull movie that quit on the viewer long before it even gets to its depressing futile ending  It appears that the magic of Spielbergs movies have been absent from his films for some six or seven years now  Here just hoping that War Horse still has some of that left in it  But despite being Rated PG and being marketed heavily and almost completely towards children The Adventures of Tintin is certainly not for young kidsThere is infrequent but very intense and brutal for an animated movie cartoon violence with several rather harsh deaths and scenes which actually also have quiet of bit of animated blood  Also there is constant nonstop drinking and alcohol use and consumption in the form of the sidecharacter of Captain Haddock who is a great drunk  Finally there is extremely infrequent mild language with only one use of real profanity in the entire movie with that being in the form of dmn  So if you did like many people did happen to like it than great  I just wish it could have been much better than it unfortunately and depressingly was,11
87304,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,The adventures of Tintin is great movie to see with family friends or by yourself  The main character is a young reporter who unknowingly falls into an adventure that takes him around the world  Tintin is well meaning and wants to help most people but also fights when he has to  I dont think many people noticed but there arent that many female characters but that doesnt hold it back  It is violent at sometimes one character getting machine gunned to death but thats the most violence  One character is usually drunk and people dont like it but he overcomes his alcoholism,6
87305,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,Great animation  My rating Intense action crude humor drinking and a murder,2
87306,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,The movie was very violent lots of gun fights dark and confusing for children   My 8yearold daughter laughed out loud a few times but she didnt understand the story  the pace was fast the vocabulary was often over her head and the allusions obscure,2
87307,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,This movie is definitely familyfriendly but as a 13yearold I was seriously disappointed  It went on too long and there were only 2 laughoutloud moments in the entire movie  It didnt really capture my attention because the storyline was hard to follow  I eventually got it but it was just confusing  My personal opinion is that this movie was boring and would definitely be enjoyed more by younger kids,5
87308,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,We run a pretty conservative household and I took my 4year old daughter and 6year old son   Bear in mind we have almost no computer time yet for them and very little TV    so our bar for acceptable media is pretty high   I was a little concerned some of the content could be scary for my daughter so we discussed in advance    Both kids just loved the movie  it was not scary to either of them and the violence was completely antiseptic in my view and not inappropriate at all   Believe me theres nothing appealing about Capt  Haddocks drinking  its a lot more likely to push kids away from a drink than towards it   Simply wonderful movie,7
87341,2623번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,The Amazing SpiderMan 2 may have a bit of mistakes but this was my absolute favorite I think what interested me was the SpiderMan costume because it looked exactly like the same suit in the comics  This movie has been AMAZING for me Andrew Garfield is awesome at SpiderMan and Emma Stone is great at acting as Gwen Stacy,4
87342,2623번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,Some good messages Think with great power comes great responsibility But sadly consumerism  With AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 costumes to hats to MARVEL SELECT toys  Do not forget McDonalds was a thing in this production BTW Andrew was my fave but now i am SUCH THE FAN of Tom Holland and even got a morphsuit of Tom Hollands Spidey suit,3
87343,2623번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,Not Really Violent Not really Sexual but lots of Consumerism  The Plot is very Clunky but overall Parents i guess its okay to let your kids watch this,2
87344,2623번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,Great SpiderMan movie  Does have a lot of violence but with really good role models,2
87345,2623번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,This movie isnt that good  It has 3 villains and a bunch of plot holes that are confusing  Overall just dont watch it  There are better spider man movies out there  As a huge spider man fan myself I feel a bit disappointed,5
87346,2623번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,This is one of the worst movies Ive ever seen  Violence includes deaths of characters disease electric shots out of hands gun shots action destruction and bombs  SpiderMan is a really bad role model and is mean to others  This movie scarred history forever,4
87347,2623번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,Andrew Garfield stars as SpiderMan in this sloppy forgettable SpiderMan movie  The plot is confusing Electro is a villain because he has no friends and Peter Parker is a jerk to multiple people  Expect lots and lots of violence and kissing in the movie that tarnished the name of SpiderMan,3
87348,2623번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,This movie is GREAT But this is important   In terms of language I heard multiple use of goddamn and damn about 3 uses of ass  5 hell and 1 Holy st  Violence includes neck snapping explosions gunfire falling from heights and choking  Overall good movie but watch it with your kids,4
87349,2623번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,i dont know why critics are calling this the worst spiderman film this had a 52 on rotten tomatoes and guess what spiderman 3 had a 63 honestly critics these days  But listen to me instead this is actually really fun so skip spiderman 3 and watch this,3

87530,2624번,The Amazing Spider-Man,8,As for why they made a reboot I am not sure as Spiderman 3 was fantastic but as for the reboot there is lots of coming book violence but the new Peter Parker is a very positive role model for young kids,1
87531,2624번,The Amazing Spider-Man,8,Its the same SpiderMan story with a different twist   Peters girlfriends father is a police chief and the villain is Peters mentor   I enjoyed it even more than the first Andrew Garfield is cute and dorky and his girlfriend Emma Stone plays your notsotypical blonde   Overall charming and a mustsee for Marvel nerds,4

88213,2641번,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,8,I really enjoyed this movie  I thought it was original and entertaining  The first stories are very funny filled with black humor other parts were depressing and other parts included splendid landscapes  However it was quite violent for young teenagers  Violence is always very quick but bloody  Some scenes include a mans fingers getting blown out a man getting shot in the neck with an arrow a man getting scalped and others  The movie had no sex or nudity except for a prostitute getting hired for sex   It had very low quantities of alcohol or drugs  Some of the characters were barbaric violent but others were lighthearted optimistic and funny  I would really recommend this to fanatics of western movies and black comedies although not everything in this movie is comical,10
88214,2641번,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,8,film has no swearing  but some strong voilence makes it a 14  but definetley a disapointment from joel and ethan coen  its no big lebowski,2
88215,2641번,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,8,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs acts as an parody of classic Westerns while adding a unique twists on typical tropes  Like how Buster Scruggs  wares a white hat a typical sign in classic Westerns that this is the good guy  But he obviously loves killing to a point its frightening and he is not the good guy  While black hats mean the bad guy the Kid wheres one and he shows no real evil acts and in the end he and Buster sing together and become allies  Now not all of them are like this as James Francos segment is quiet but still action packed  Some depictions of  Native Americans Indigenous are racist they work well for the movie as it works with the hypercritical nature of the view of the old west  The third segment was the best by far as it showed emotional depth while there is barely a word spoken  The costumes and set design are phenomenal and everything culminating together this is a must watch,8
88216,2641번,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,8,This movie is pretty good  However I started to lose interest after the films fourth short film,2
88217,2641번,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,8,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a great film with six episodes in a two hour time space  It was made by the Coen Brothers  The only problem in this film is violence but if you can handle violence in movies or just remember its fake blood its all ok It should be fine for a twelve or thirteen year old,3
88218,2641번,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,8,Do not bother watching this repetitive boring unnecessarily gruesome disgrace of a movie  It is well acted but the whole story is without a plot theme or even a main character the trailer was really good and portrayed this film as being funny and an adventure but it was not in any way amusing and had no adventure,2
88219,2641번,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,8,Hilarious brutal sad and dark  Some graphic violence so best for mature 12 or 13  Thought provoking messages though,3
88220,2641번,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,8,Very good Coen Brothers quality  Starts out very funny and progressively gets darker  Pretty violent but not consistent and not overlygraphic as in a Tarantino film  Language is minimal  Some stories are better than others but overall very good  Occasionally confusing,6

88379,2653번,The BFG,8,Youre going to think I am crazy for saying 9 and 2 stars but I watched this when I was what 7 or 8 and I didnt like it  It was scary sometimes and boring all the other times  I made it through the whole movie finally when I was 8 or 9 but I wasnt paying attention because it was SO BORING  UGH,5
88380,2653번,The BFG,8,I love the book for this movie just as much,1
88381,2653번,The BFG,8,Of course I love anything Roald Dahl inspired  The BFG is funny lighthearted and has the beautiful message of believing in yourself even if you feel small  Beware small children may be scared on the bigger giants who steal children from their beds and eat them,3
88382,2653번,The BFG,8,I love this movie especially when the Queens corgis go flying round and up the house,1
88383,2653번,The BFG,8,i read this book at school when i was 10 and i saw the movie when i ws seven years old this is an amazing book to read to kids and it is very entertaining,1
88384,2653번,The BFG,8,Boring and Confusing  This movie is so confusing only 11 would know whats going on  NOT A FAN,3
88385,2653번,The BFG,8,my mom thought the giants were a little bit scary but from my point of view it was a non scary silly adventurous movie,1
88396,2653번,The BFG,7,Its a great variation of the book  It has a bit of toilet humour but kids will love it A bit of scariness but not that much  I loved the slimy vegetables All in all it was pretty good,5
88397,2653번,The BFG,7,A bit boring but some bits can be funny the giant is well made and it seems real the acting rolls are not to bad depending on the scene,1
88398,2653번,The BFG,7,The movie is a great idea its perfect for children and even people who enjoy movies such as this its nothing like any other giant movie i hope youll like it as much as i did,1
88399,2653번,The BFG,7,This movie is amazing They just dont make movies like this anymore where it can be entertaining without cursing or inappropriate content  Pros funny no cussing animation is breathtaking plus the storyline is interesting for all ages  Cons a whole scene is dedicated to fart jokes but it was pretty funny though violence that can scare small children but besides that its a great movie,4
88400,2653번,The BFG,7,For me the movie was positively boring and not very exciting  For my mom and dad they thought it was great  It definitely was not what I expected based on the trailers however it has great heart and a positive message  Personally I would not recommend it especially for younger kids  I think younger kids would find it too thoughtprovoking and a bit too slow and lack of magic,5
88401,2653번,The BFG,7,the BFG was a very good movie If you have toddlers or 6 and below kids I prefer not to watch with them But otherwise sureAt times it can be dark or scary At others they teach you lessons or it can be funny,1
88402,2653번,The BFG,7,The BFG brings back to film industry to Steven Spielberg with a genuine work aimed at adults and infants that covets to has the same impact than the previous classics of the director nevertheless his film does not capture such pleasures,1
88403,2653번,The BFG,7,This is a lovely movie for families  Some scenes might scare young children under 7  It was a bit boring but very good  Worth seeing it,5
89292,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,Epic sequel has tons of actionviolence,1
89293,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,This is a great sequel and has a great plot but it is violent  There is also some swearing such as one use of fcking and a few uses of st dan and as,2
89294,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,The Bourne Supremacy  yeah its not brilliant in my opinion but its still a good action sequel and better than Identity with more action scenes but hopefully Ultimatum will be even better  There are some violent brutal scenes although not much blood and an Fword so Id recommend this for ages 13 and up  Not bad  An improvement on the soso first film,4
89295,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,This movie is pretty good  Its the second Bourne movie and I enjoyed it a lot,2
89296,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,The Bourne Supremacy improves from the previous movie by doubling up the thrills action and fun to make an even better sequel  This movie does have tons and tons of violence but same as its first movie it is fine for older Tweens and up,2
89297,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,Language 4 510  Violence 810  Sexy Content 010,1
89298,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,This movie is brilliant  It is the second movie in the Bourne series  It is wellacted but pretty violent  Bourne is an easy model to root for although he beats up and kills potential assassins and injures innocent bystanders in a heartstopping car chase  One man shoots himself but we are spared the full gore  Another man gets stabbed by a fellow agent  Jason fights another man which ends up with strangulation  Jasons girlfriend is shot by an assassins bullet meant for him,8
89299,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,This is a pretty good movie with a hell lot of violence blood and killing  The language son of a b is normal,2
89300,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,The Bourne Supremacy is as outstanding as the first  With hard intense action which has my favorite scene in the film the fight is the house  It was gripping and realistic since there was no music in the background until it was over an excellent continuation of the story great acting from Damon and new additions Joan Allen Brian Cox and Karl Urban and John Powells score is great  Grade A,4
89301,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,My ratingR for strong violence some racy content alcohol use and language throughout,1
89941,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,I watched this with my 12 year old cousin and he was fine the blood and gore is over the top but it is by unrealistic monsters it is a great film if you can handle blood,1
89942,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,Okay first of all I wanted to see this movie really badly  So I saw it  I hate this movie  I dont like movies when literally the whole thing is gallons and gallons of blood is just spurting out everywhere every 5 seconds  This movie is so stupid dont even think about wasting money to see this  Its pointless with pretty much no plot,6
89943,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,Cabin in the Woods doesnt go for the easy horror movie laughs that the Scary Movie franchise tries to elicit but it is a curiously interesting satire on why horror movies can be so cliched and ridiculous at times  The movie itself isnt too scary save for a few jump scares but its wit keeps it afloat and distinguishes it among other lesser flicks,2
89944,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,Cabin In The Woods had a great concept but I felt overall the actual movie was very weak and bland  Now on to the parents guide  I watched this movie knowing that it would have gore and language but I didnt know how gory this movie would be  It was pretty bad the first part of the film but about the last thirty minutes of the film it is a total gore fest  There was one scene where in about two minutes in one room monsters escape and grisly kill the men in the room and blood shoots on the roof and on the wall and floor and people are ripped in half and dismembered and decapitated and eaten all in one room the violence made me shiver and one of my favorite movies are kill bill so strongly caution with 14  there  is also one scene of nudity and tons of drugs and language,5
89945,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,As the title said Cabin in the Woods is very dark  It can be very disturbing at points to  It was very well written though and it has a lot of humor  I enjoyed it a lot  It is a very good new take on the horror genre,5
89946,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,The Cabin in the Woods adds new ideas to the horror genre which is falling apart it is visually stunning not that scary but the violence language sex and drinking makes it not recommended for under 15 this age specifically because it is more funny than scary but it has a lot,1
89947,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,I really enjoyed this movie and thought it was clever  I didnt like the drug use and sexuality in the movie there wasnt too too much but there was enough and I think the movie would have been better without it  The main thing about this movie is it is very gory and not good for kids and if your sondaughter can handle lots of blood and scary monsters its fine  If not then do not let them watch this it is very VERY gory,4
89948,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,I am not at all a fan of horror movies but I loved this movie  Its hilarious interesting and refreshingly original  I was 16 when I saw this and had no problems with it but wouldnt recommend it to anyone much younger than that,3
89949,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,The Cabin in the Woods definitely has a witty screenplay and is a smart horror comedy  It features excellent direction and some decent acting  Very original and unique but pause for kids fifteen and under  The film has some sexual contentnudity heavy language some smoking and drug use from a certain character and a large amount of violence  A,5
89950,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,this movie scares me to death  i dont wanna watch itnot only that it is really scarybutit has innapropriate languageand i dont like itand theres drugs in it and i heard that drugs will make you really sicki hate this movie i wish movies like this were never invented,4
90009,2712번,The Case Against 8,8,My ratingPG13 for mature content and language,1
90034,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,I like a lot of Studio Ghibli movies but OMG this is the best The animation is so cute and like everyone else I fell in love with Baron Humbert von Gikkingen  Hes so dashing and handsome  Its  a short but sweet film and one of my top recommendations,4
90035,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,OMG best Ghibli film ever  I loved all the characters and everything was adorable  To be honest I fell in love with the baron  In my opinion best anime film ever,5
90036,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,This film was was extremely easy to watch and follow with the storyline being typical of a normal movie  I do just think that this is just a nice kidsfamily movie that you wont have any problems with  The Baron to me is a bit like Sherlock Holmes with his British accent and mannerisms the only thing I was a bit disappointed about was that the plot from Whisper of the Heartthe movie that The Cat Returns is a spinoff of isnt picked up with his missing girlfriend which is a shame  But if you havent watched the previous film then you dont need to worry about that also you dont need to have watched Whisper of the Heart to watch this film there isnt all that much that connects them  I liked the protagonist Haru she did have her assertive moments but then there were also moments where I felt like she was the damsel in distress which I thought went a bit against her character   This movie is suitable for everyone it has nothing upsetting or inappropriate in it and I could imagine myself liking it from as young as when I was in nursery  Overall this is just a heartwarming movie that to me is nothing all that original or differenthence the three star rating but would definitely be a nice one for kids or families to watch as a short fun film,7
90037,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,The Cat Returns is a very interesting movie The cats in my opinion are a little creepy but later in the movie I got used to them It has romance in it  which I didnt like Some cats get thrown out windows which is a little scary One of the main characters almost died and that also scared me But overall the movie is really funny and a good family movie,1
90038,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,The Cat Returns deserves five stars for its quirky characters cute cats and its theme  The main theme was definitely hidden and I found it  I noticed the characters seem to depend on if someone is cool or not  Haru the main character starts the movie with being late and gets in trouble  She is walking home from school and sees a cat in the street and a big truck is going towards the cat and Haru saves him with her lacrosse stick  Will Haru regret this decision when she finds out who she saved Will she regret listening to the whisper from above And will she regret Calling another cat Moota fat,8
90039,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,This is another lovely masterpiece from Ghibli This visually pleasing story about a girl who is swept away to the kingdom of cats after rescuing their prince is a hilarious adorable film that I would definitely recommend   Although there is a slight amount of adult humor that will go over kids heads it is one of the cutest and most memorable films of the genre  10 is quite extreme,4
90040,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,While The Cat Returns is Studio Ghiblis shortest feature film to date 11 mins shorter than My Neighbor Totoro its worth a watch if you like humour excitement and talking cats  ADVISORY Not much scariness or violence two cats have a short sword duel with no notable injuries the lower half of a tower is blown but the upper half doesnt collapse and noone on top or ground is hurt two cats are thrown out of a window but they are not seen getting hurt  Little to no swearing a character confesses she has a crush and the main storyline is about the main character being forced to marry a cat but there is absolutely no sex in the movie cats are seen drinking something in a feast but its not stated to be alcohol  The main positive message is about believing in yourself and accepting yourself as who you are  REVIEW This lesser known Studio Ghibli film surprised me positively with its lightness humour and simple but beautiful animation style  The characters are well done from Harus insecure awkwardness to the Barons gentleman calmness and Mutas flippant streetmans speech   While The Cat Returns lacks the high stakes breathtaking art and long running time of other Ghibli films sometimes its just relaxing to forget the world around you for little over an hour and dive into the magical nonsense of the Kingdom of Cats,7
90041,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,This films style is ridiculous and hilarious  It is about a teenage girl named Haru who saves a cat who then talked to her   She is then introduced by a bunch of talking cats to the Cat Kingdom  Along the way she meets a living crow statue and living humanoid cat mannequin  The movie is laughoutloud hilarious throughout  I could probably watch it again and again  Its hilarious because of the ridiculousness of the situations from talking cats showering Haru with gifts that only cats like and wanting Haru to marry the cat prince just for saving one of their cats and the dialogue that the cats engage in with Haru and each other  Its like My Neighbor Totoro with a lot of unintentional humor of the sobaditsgood type but it also has lots of intentional humor which is all good as well  The way they did the English dub wasnt half bad  It actually sounded like the way people would speak in English  The visual style was good too looking colorful the outlines being thin and the characters looking almost realistic  The storys plot wasnt too complex but it was still good  I was able to identify a clear threeact structure but it was fast paced and always funny  The characters are good  Theres the grumpy fat cat Muta the outofhismind Cat King the fish out of water Haru and many others  The story is good but the real standout is the humor  You have to see this movie to believe how good it is  One last thing Why is this movie called The Cat Returns When was the first time the cat came But thats just the title not the movie itself  Why did Common Sense give this movie a 10 rating Its perfectly fine for kids,22
90042,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,The cat returns is a fantasy adventure film in the classic studio ghibli mold  It has great characters and has a positive message about believing in yourself and helping others  There is some fantasy violence and mild peril but nothing too scary  If you like cats youll love this film,4
90043,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,The Cat Returns is a heartwarming epic adventure  There is a little bit of fighting a few cats are thrown out a window and muta  is shown stuck in a big bowl of catnip jelly  Haru talks about a crush on a boy and falls in love with Baron  Language is not a problem just some words like idiot and fatso,4
90454,2738번,The Croods,6,This is a really good movie  It could be scary for younger audiences but it tells a great story with a lot of adventure,2
90455,2738번,The Croods,6,Not very memorable film with somewhat unlikeable charactersrushed plotand unfunny humorbut at least the anmation and voice acting save the day here,1
90456,2738번,The Croods,6,there isnt anything wrong except when grug tells  the story and at the end when he says DIEEEEEEEEEE thats kind of dark but other than that its good,1
90457,2738번,The Croods,6,Great movie why is everyone saying its violent it really isnt it is pg 13 for a reason great movie I loved it when I was younger,1
90458,2738번,The Croods,6,Isnt too much violence  Just a little here and there like a couple Tiger bites  No cussing or sex,3
90459,2738번,The Croods,6,If you are working put this movie on the TV for your kidsThey will not disturb you,2
90460,2738번,The Croods,6,THE CROODS holds strong messages about family but parents may need to know that there are some scenes that may scare young children,1
90461,2738번,The Croods,6,Its my favorite movie in the whole entire universe  I love it the most  I think its funny,3
90690,2759번,The Devil Wears Prada,8,This movie is about fashion so kids may get bored in this movie  It doesnt Target audiences much but still a nice movie and the soundtrack is good,2
90691,2759번,The Devil Wears Prada,8,I loved this movie Its absolutely original and everyone casted was the best  If you dont appreciate or perhaps understand fashion you might find it boring  Theres a lot of clothing transformations and its all really nice for me,4
90692,2759번,The Devil Wears Prada,8,Fashion friends job and sx  Fun movie to watch with the family or a group of friends  Some cursing but nothing too serious  Occasional sx but only women in lingerie and topless men  All the characters are likeable and hilarious,5
90693,2759번,The Devil Wears Prada,8,This is a very good movie and I understand why it is pg13  There is some pretty strong language but no f bombs that I can remember  They character emily seems to have an eating disorderbody image issues  All of the people who work at runway have issues with body image and ridicule andy who is actually very healthy and beautiful for being a size 6  You should tell your kids that this is wrong  some sex also but no nudity  a few drinking scenes,7
90694,2759번,The Devil Wears Prada,8,Directed by David Frankel The Devil Wears Prada is a great story about finding who you really are  Starring Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway it combines comedy and drama into a meaningful film  What if a woman fresh out of college gets a job working for a highly successful fashion company Andy is fresh out of college and really wants to be a journalist in New York  She applies for a job for the fashion magazine Runway and under famous Miranda the chief editor of Runway  She miraculously gets the job despite her terrible fashion sense  Over time she gets busier and gradually makes her way up the ranks as an employee and as an assistant to Miranda,7
90695,2759번,The Devil Wears Prada,8,It is SUCH a great movie Yes it does have some cursing and sx but other than that it is SO good  Provides a great message choose kind and nice over skinny and glamorous and dont let people treat you like crap,3

91688,2809번,The Founder,8,At first I really despised the ending  The ending showed how if you have perserverance you can crush other peoples dreams  I didnt like that because I thought they were celebrating it  But if you look at it like a cautionary tale its a mighty fun ride,4
91689,2809번,The Founder,8,I personally really liked this movie although it had words like F   KS   T and ass it had a strong message of persevere  and love,1
91690,2809번,The Founder,8,The movie The Founder is a very well made film about the coming of McDonalds  It is not the most charming story as the main character steals ideas and breaks contracts to get ahead and beat other people  Although it displays a message that you can do anything you can dream of at any age,3
91691,2809번,The Founder,8,Howit starts put as ray just selling his invention to him becoming more of a villian in the movie  He divorces his wife and puts the original mcdonalda out of business  Definitely puts a different eye on why not to go to mc donalds ontop of that its fake and unhealthy foods,3
91692,2809번,The Founder,8,I really enjoyed this movie  Though somewhat selfish and not a great role model Ray Kroc does show tremendous work ethic and perseverance and keeps fighting for his vision until it is realized  Overall the movie highlights the importance of hard work and never giving up,3
91693,2809번,The Founder,8,The reviews call it an ad for McDonalds not at all This movie shows the story of the founder of McDonalds a sleazy dirtbag who stole the company from the real founders and screwed them over in the process  SPOILERS,3
91694,2809번,The Founder,8,This is a real story about a guy that owns McDonalds,1

92005,2823번,The Good Dinosaur,7,Admiring dino learns positive messages,1
92006,2823번,The Good Dinosaur,7,BOO It was very boring dark and depressing nothing like the original Pixar movies  Arlo is a Wimp whining and asking his parents permission for every little thing  Spot cant Hulk out  Thunderclap is the worst villain ever  And the only thing that he loved was himself so throwing Arlos dad off a cliff to a river would do nothing  This scene is stolen from Mufasas death  You do not throw some one you truly love off a cliff It was and remains to this very day the worst movie I have ever seen  The only good part was the end,10
92007,2823번,The Good Dinosaur,7,Scared the snot out of me when I was little I would leave the room during the pterodactyls part  Scared me so bad  I literally would start crying when one of my family members put on this  movie,3
92008,2823번,The Good Dinosaur,7,It feels like getting trapped in a weird dejavu nightmare,1
92009,2823번,The Good Dinosaur,7,Ive never watched this movie but this is my least favorite Pixar movie It is boring childish emotional and a waste of time Maybe little kids are probably like it and teens are probably get bored  Okay the scene of Arlos dad dying stolen from Mufasas death in The Lion King The plot which is not good at all The pterodactyl IDR what is name was is a weakest Pixar villain ever And Arlo is quite not a good role model  Hes probably arrogant and annoying as possible  He was in the second place for the least good Pixar hero first being Merida  I only like is the animation because its beautiful releastic and its quite topnotch but this movie is trash And Spot which is a likable character  I really painful to look at is Arlo and Spot getting drunk  Its so weird I only watched this scene  When I was 9 saw the good Dinosaur for the first time merchandises and commercial I quite dont like it because its boring  Dont watch this movie because it is a waste of time and this Pixar movie is so unlikeable If you liked The Good Dinosaur your opinion will be respect so I understand  Edit For response to my supporter Dogcat  Thank you I really appreciate that you reviewed WALLE But youve never watched this  You saw this movie a little bit in elementary school but not remembered anything that much  I remembered this movie when I was a toddler seeing an advertisement in the theater but I thought it was childish  At 9 I only watched this scene of WALLE and EVE dancing in space  I thought EVE is a boy and a best friend and I dont know what her name is  I mistaken that EVE is WALLEs girlfriend Now since 13 I love it Not childish anymore Its awesome family film WALLE is one of my favorite Pixar movies ever and Im a fan I know all of the scenes I think youve never watched all of Pixar movies except Finding Dory Cars 3 and Inside Out  I think these movies youve never watched Up WALLE like you said before Finding Nemo Monsters Inc and amp Monsters University Toy Story movies A Bugs Life Coco The Incredibles Nadia Clouds favorite Pixar movie Ratatouille Brave Cars 1 and 2 and Soul  I would like to let me know if you watched or never watched these Pixar movies And have seen these movies before but never watched these  Thank you See ya ,38
92010,2823번,The Good Dinosaur,7,a lot of you said this movie was sad or scary but I was 8 when I saw this and I was so bored  I knew what death is and all that but I was so bored I couldnt focus on the violent parts or the story  Now that Im 13 contrary to what the bottom of my review might say I might rewatch this movie and possibly be able to focus on the story  If you or your kid friend parent or whoever wanted to see this film out of curiosity in terms of the trailer I would not reccomend watching this  This is kind of offtopic but I had the same reaction to big hero 6 but I was 6 at the time and like I said my reaction was same but I whined and complained things like waa and mommy Im not having fun  I didnt know boredom is a word And that movie might be better if there was a better explanation on what was going on to the kids  btw I did not understand what death is at age 6,6
92011,2823번,The Good Dinosaur,7,I saw this when I was seven  I adored dinosaurs so I was like Oh my goodness a dinosaur movie thats animated I need to see this So when we went on a holiday to Perth to see some of my family I thought that would be a perfect time it was still in cinemas So we booked in a time and then we arrived  Long story short I was slightly sick at the time so a lot more emotional  I pretty much never cry at movies and I didnt usually even way back then so yes you know where this is going I CRYED THROUGH THE LITERAL WHOLE ENTIRE MOVIE LITERALLY EVERY SCENE WAS DARK AND DEPRESSING AND IT DIDNT EVEN HAVE A HAPPY ENDING,7
92012,2823번,The Good Dinosaur,7,Well all and all this is a great movie to watch with your family   There are a couple scenes that are sad like a scene where he loses his dad in a flood  And in one scene a character rips a cute bugs head off  soo l would make this a pretty good movie,4
92156,2826번,The Goonies,6,I personally love this movie  Its one of the first 80s movies I saw and its very funny and the characters grow on you,2
92157,2826번,The Goonies,6,This movie is a bit scary but not terryifiying my 6 your old brother was a bit scared but liked it I rate this movie 7,1
92158,2826번,The Goonies,6,Great movie ok for tweens though there is a lot of bad language but it is funny but also is action becuase a boy is on a hunt for one eyed willies treasure a few scares though there are some good messages and is a fun family movie,1
92159,2826번,The Goonies,6,This film is a must see 80s classic the humour the thrills the iconic quotes  this film has it all made mostly for kids though there is some language and scary scenes,1
92160,2826번,The Goonies,6,I wanted this film when I was 11 and I was in Secondary school  I already know every word that they said and I understood everything  A character does pretend to hang himself in the beginning but nothing really happened  One of the main characters does trick a lady who isnt English that the family keep drugs and she will be locked up with cockroaches with no food or water but nothing happens And there is a bit of swearing and a statues penis gets broken and they try to glue it back on But the film shows friendship and loyalty to each other  It shows you cant get by in life if you dont have people looking out for you  Even if they annoy you all the time,6
92161,2826번,The Goonies,6,Great movie with great messages and role models I bit of swearing some kissing and one scene with a naked statue the criminals smoke a little and scary at some times,2
92162,2826번,The Goonies,6,its ok,1
92163,2826번,The Goonies,6,halarius and some language,1
92164,2826번,The Goonies,6,I watched this movie when I was about 8  I was an absolute wuss so Sloth is the only thing that scared me  Obviously it was made in the 80s so it should be rated PG13 because of swearing and sexual references  I dont think the swearing or innuendos are a problem because if they are young it will go over their heads and if they are older they are probably hearing it anyway  In the beginning there is a faked hanging and later a dead body and skeletons  Nothing really that I would say is supper worrisome,6
92165,2826번,The Goonies,6,This movie is so good but it has bad words like st andbullst and Andy kisses Brand ,1
92190,2826번,The Goonies,7,This Movie had talk of drugs in the beginning but also had swearing  I liked this Movie because it was funny to watch in 2018  The only complaint I have is you cant understand one of the kids  The kids name is Data,4
92191,2826번,The Goonies,7,Its an 80s movie and rating systems were different back then  Kids do inappropriate things and has mature themes  I like the adventure and the story  I just believe its more for older audiences,3
92192,2826번,The Goonies,7,This movie is awesome  I saw this movie when I was seven and my older sister was eight  I remember at the end of the movie her saying it was scary and yes it can be  If kids have a fear of strangers chasing them they might want to wait until they get older  Also there are a lot of scaring words so if you have an elevenyearold that is very immature wait until heshe is older and knows not to repeat them but there are no really bad words  There are a few kisses and scary scenes too  Recommended for mature tweens,7
92193,2826번,The Goonies,7,I havent seen this movie in a few years but when I was 6 years old all I remembered was that I was so obsessed with The Goonies after I watched it  Some reviews state that situations are inappropriate but from what I recall this was a brilliant adventure made for kids  Go watch this classic,3
92194,2826번,The Goonies,7,I watched this when I was 6 didnt understand some stuff,1
92195,2826번,The Goonies,7,A great movie to watch with the whole  family Beware  some language  All the main character are fighting for the right to keep there homes,2
92196,2826번,The Goonies,7,The Goonies was OK but there is swearing   Words used include shi and dam  There was a lot of editing mistakes I noticed as well  Also there were a few sexual scenes,4
92197,2826번,The Goonies,7,Curious to see the reviews on this movie I read a couple of them  I think the parents are overreacting   My mom bought this movie for us and we all had some good laughs They say sht 19 times but thats what every kid will here in the real world do dont make them live under a rock My mom was very glad she bought this movie because not many kids movies make me laugh This would probably be a PG13 movie nowadays but nonetheless a great funny movie the whole family can enjoy Many kids in my class love this movie For little kids most of the sex jokes and bad words just fly right over their heads usually its not clear what they mean and could be easily interpreted as something else that is not bad  Enjoy watching,9
92198,2826번,The Goonies,7,its a good movie,1
92255,2828번,The Grandmaster,8,My rating PG13 some intense violence,1
94929,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,,2
94930,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,I was OBSESSED with this movie It has quite a bit of violence but its not horrible  There is not that much swearing  The reason why I give 10 and up is because theres nothing horrible in this movie  If you like the series divergent you would like this movie A LOT,5
94931,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,The movie tells the story of Katniss Everdeen in a competition with 24 other contestants and only 1 can live  There is not much blood but some scenes are very violent and somewhat suspenseful  Katniss is a strong role model too,3
94932,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,Parents Katniss is one of the best role models I have ever seen   The movie is pretty violent though it is not afraid to show some blood  Critical This film is a thought provoking adventure about a future world which celebrates a battle to the death disguised as a reality show known only as the Hunger Games  The second hour is very intense THIS PART WAS RETARDED My only complaint is that it is too long before the titular conflict starts  Overall 4 65,5
94933,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,This is REALLY violent You better read the book or see the 2nd movie You see a LOT of blood and its more for like a 11 year old or a MATURE 10 YEAR OLD if you really LOVE your  9 year old  up kids dont watch this Its VERY scary but the Second movie is good 10 up can see catching fire D D,7
94934,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,I liked it when I watched it then I went to go see catching fire and now I hate this film along with Catching fire  The dumbest movies I have ever witnessed  Too violent sad and WAY too intense  But is there anything good about this movie Well I like the soundtrack and I can tell that it was very well edited and they did a great job on it  I just dont like it,6
94935,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,Its a great book full of emotions and struggles  I wouldnt recommend this for younger kids since its got mature themes,2
94936,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,There is a lot of violence  This is something to look into because the movie is really all about an event that is all out violence  There is some swearing and not too much but a bit of sexual content  There is also drinking  So before letting a 10yearold see this movie see what they can and cant handle,5
94937,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,The movie was as good as the book and almost have the same scenes as the book  You should really watch the movie first then read the book because when i try reading the book at age 10 it was kind of hard to understand so i decided to wait for the movie to come out and see what happens  I understand way better after seeing the movie so i read the book and now i understand everything But readers i dont recommend this movie to anyone under 15 because of the violence and the gore,4
94938,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,The movie is fine except at the beginning its really boring  There is some violence I dont really remember most of it but it wasnt too bad  Oh ya at one part the creepy dogs were scary  I think most kids would be ok with it if they can skip the kissing There is some kissing  I didnt have nightmares or anything from the movie  Its no worse than Iron Man and those movies  Almost the same for violence and action  I guess you just have to know if your kid would be ok with it  My mom and dad knew I would be ok,10
95776,2881번,The Incredibles,7,Yes I consider this a superhero movie because IRON MAN 3 a big name Marvel movie STEALS the plot point   Look at how much that made and youll know what Im talking about   It has some adult stuff in it but it will probably fly over the kids heads   Also your kid WILL BE addicted to superheros after this GUARANTEE,4
95777,2881번,The Incredibles,7,a really good cartoon,1
95778,2881번,The Incredibles,7,Cool,1
95779,2881번,The Incredibles,7,really good some sex and violence but this is one of not Pixars not little kids movies,2
95780,2881번,The Incredibles,7,The Incredibles is definitely worth your time  The plot and storyline is good the CGI is wonderful and the movie itself is just EPIC If youre a fan of action packed films or CGI youll probably love this,3
95781,2881번,The Incredibles,7,its good,1
95782,2881번,The Incredibles,7,Yep its incredible alright  I love this film  Great CGI perfect acting amazing writing and the plot is super creative and just VERY wellexucted sorry if I spelt that wrong,3
95783,2881번,The Incredibles,7,My favorite movie as a kid still to this day a huge superhero fan I have to warn u the robot will scare young kids  scared me but that didnt stop me from watching it   my only problem is the powers werent creative  they are the same as fantastic 4s,6
95784,2881번,The Incredibles,7,perfect,1
95976,2890번,The Iron Giant,7,Seriously CSM my 2yr old cousin watches this like every day and he loves it  Also what the hell is inappropriate about laxitives all it does is give you diarrhea and help with diets  What Im saying is that this movie is so great and appropriate that even the youngest children will probably love this,3
95977,2890번,The Iron Giant,7,Good and funny movie with happy and sad bits   Nice style of cartoons   Happy ending,3
95978,2890번,The Iron Giant,7,This movie is an absolute masterpiece  But it is quite dark but thats just one of the things that make it so good  It definitely stays true to its 1957 setting but it might not be appropriate for younger kids  The main protagonist is a 9 year old boy named Hogarth Hughes who befriends a giant robot from outer space  Although the robot is friendly the main antagonist a U S  government official named Kent Mansley is paranoid of him possibly due to the Cold War  There is a scene where Hogarth secretly slips chocolateflavored laxatives into Mansleys smoothie I think this was to ditch him   There is also another scene where a deer is shot and even a scene where Mansley uses Chloroform in Hogarth  The film also uses words like Hell and Damn  However there are also positive messages  For example Hogarth tells the Iron Giant things like Killing is Bad Guns Kill You are who you choose to be and Souls dont die  At the end Mansleys paranoia causes him to launch a missile that he later finds out spells certain doom on the whole town  As the town looks up in the sky knowing they are just mere minutes from death the Iron Giant decides to sacrifice himself by flying into the missile before its even close to the ground in a very emotional scene saving the town  6 months later the Iron Giant is revealed to be starting to be selfrebuilt right before the movie cuts to black  Its an amazing film but might not be suitable for little kids  Its also a perfect illustration of 1957 USA,15
95979,2890번,The Iron Giant,7,A boy finds this creature from outer space teaches it about the world tries but fails to convince anyone about his discovery and later the government attempts to hunt down the creature  E T  the ExtraTerrestrial right Yes and no  Though very similar and a lot less content worries The Iron Giant set in the 1950s when the Russians had just deployed the Sputnik into space distinguishes itself from E T  by one 100 ft  metal man,6
95980,2890번,The Iron Giant,7,Huh  I seem to have a very long pattern of liking cartoons on the front where the animation can seemingly cover up the plot holes bad voice acting generic storyline e t c  When you start to put aside the animation and put a supreme focus on pure quality you may relook at youre favorite movies and go Wow  This has gotten a LOT worse  I mean a LOT worse  This seems to be somewhat of a normality among todays audiences and this is 2015 so maybe as much as everyone loves it they will relook at Inside Out and say   Okay maybe thats a bit too much  There are some cartoons however that are so dated that its much much easier to look at the very apparent flaws in the movie and not love it in the first place  At this point this is where The Iron Giant is doomed  Sure it may have lasted a little to make enough money for the Warner Bros to continue and such whereas even the current movies will be looked down at eventually but old movies such as Citizen Kane have so much to fall back on even if it is outdated the smart acting stellar storyline fantastic directing I could go on forever  These arent the movies that become outdated but The Iron Giant really doesnt have that to fall back on  The characters are rather traditional and really pushes it to see how moral they can go before it becomes something of a school project to induce good morals which isnt a good thing in movies where the adults have been over that and want to see quality  So youngsters may enjoy it and that alone would be a fair reason to go out and see it but there are even more primary flaws to come The voice acting is also the cheesy moral thing and the animation is very choppy not detailed and supremely 2Dish  The storyline also doesnt do anything creative  Its a lot easier to look over the flaws of a movie if the cartoon aspect doesnt affect you so maybe I should start rewatching as well  But although not too quality the young children maybe five or six adding to the fact that only a bit of peril will not bother them might not be as affected by the issues that make this movie as problematic as it is  Itll actually be one of their favorites if the parents are open to a bit of peril and notatallbadviolence which they probably will be  Movies0000,18
95981,2890번,The Iron Giant,7,It was a lot different from the usual movies either princesses or super heroes always are the majority of the viewers  This movie was a very interesting one and teaches good lessons to children,2
95982,2890번,The Iron Giant,7,I think its a really sweet touching story that the whole family will enjoy and it is very funny in some parts  I definitely recommend it  Its awesome,3
95983,2890번,The Iron Giant,7,this is a very good movie but the end is sad and used to make me cry when i was little,1
95984,2890번,The Iron Giant,7,I am 7 years old and I really really did not I repeat did not like it at all   beucause I think that it was incredibly sad a specially beucause of the end and the scene with the deer,2
96089,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,This film nails it right on the head as far as quality goes and even though its not a musical they do homage to a few of the songs e g  Bare neccities I wanna be like you Trust in me   Unlike the animated classic it is more entertaining and has more of a plot  And the CGI is beautiful as well  Share Khan was AWESOME Oh and he was quite intimidating as well and kills at least one character  Kaa is kind of creepy but her scene was awesome no WinneThePooh voice instead Scarlett Johansten  Overall very fun film,8
96090,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,The actor who played Mowgli is so talented and telling from the fact that he was the only human actor shown on screen he did absolutely amazing  The special effects are terrific to    You can barely tell on most animals that they are not real In some scenes it is very quiet but then something very surprising happens which can make you jump  Thats why I think that kids 9 and up would enjoy it better since they are used to movies that may be a little more intense,4
96091,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,The Jungle Book is about how Mowgli Neel Sethi has to find his way back to the man village as a fearsome tiger named Shere Khan Idris Elba is on the hunt for him  The Jungle Book is a film that I feel is  too charming and joyful to not like  There are some moments where i was on the edge of my seat or biting my nails or jumping when Shere Khan is on screen popping up everywhere  The voice talents are amazing my personal favorite being Idris Elba as Shere Khan,4
96092,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,I recently watched this at the theaters on a special outing with my grandparents  Though it is targeted toward a younger audience I thought it was a excellent movie for any age full of excitement fun and a lesson on learning to be who you are  Standalone actor Neel Sethi the young lead protagonist took it all on himself and surprisingly did a amazing job  I say at least four stars,4
96093,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,You can really tell that its just a kid in a green room the whole time because the acting is really weak  None of the reactions from Mowgli feel genuine and why would they Special effects are stunning of course  Bill Murray was Bill Murray and Christopher Walken was great as the enormous fleshy orangutan king,4
96094,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,This movie is really fun and the graphics are really cool   The panther bear and wolves looked so cuddly    There is no language that I remember hearing   There are a few parts that are scary when the giant monkey chases him and captures him and when Sheer Khan the tiger is chasing him and threatening to kill him   It would scare a younger audience but when I went there with my 11 year old friend she loved it   I did not like the monkey because his singing was really annoying   There are two songs in the movie   The monkey sings a song and then Bear Necessities is sang   There is a lot of clean humor that much younger kids would not understand but I thought it was funny   There are a few parts that are intense and make you jump but all in all it was a great movie,10
96095,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,A word of advice if youre seeing this film  dont be holding anything that could spill  You will jump out of your seat  I promise  The movie isnt all that bad though  It had some gorgeous animation and a really sweet story,5
96096,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with this one  The trailer looked gorgeous but of course theres always the chance that the movie doesnt live up to the advertisement I couldnt be more wrong  The very first scene begins with a chasetraining of some sort and it immediately captured my attention  I didnt particularly love the young actor who portrayed Mowgli at first but he eventually began to grow on me  The cinematography is beautiful the animals are realistic the battles scenes between the animals keep you wonderfully sitting on the edge of your seat  Even if you arent familiar with the story of The Jungle Book classic you can still enjoy this film  Theres quite a bit of violence throughout the film such as the animals attacking each other but I wouldnt consider it an unnecessary to the movie  Its a film both children and adults will love and the high ratings that its received is by no means an overstatement  I would encourage you to go see it  Its probably the best film Ive seen this year,9
96097,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,Parents should be aware that this version of The Jungle Book is darker more intense and scarier than the original 1967 picture  It is an amazing visual experience the CGI is incredibly realistic and the green screen is flawless  This enhances the viewing but also makes the fight scenes scarier  A very minor amount of blood can be seen just a few cuts and bruises and the fight between animals feature loud sound effects clawing biting but no blood  One death will hit hard as it happens very quickly and has a jump scare  Speaking of jump scares there are three or four of them in The Jungle Book  Children under 8 wont be able to handle them  The film has some serious gritty moments but also some very fun and joyful moments songs jokes etc   It is an amazing experience with Oscar worthy visual effects stellar voice acting Ben Kingsley Scarlett Johanson Idris Elba and humour  Children under 8 may need to cover their eyes for 1 or 2 scenes but not often,10
96098,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,ModarateViolencescary scenesperilupsetting scenes  Very mild language  However the film is about friends and teamwork but the are explained through emotional moments,3
96309,2904번,The Karate Kid,8,I think that most kids can definitely watch this although younger kids might find it boring  It does have some fight scenes so if your child is sensitive to violence this may not be a good pick  It really just depends on your child  I think its a great movie,4
96310,2904번,The Karate Kid,8,i think this is awesome,1
96311,2904번,The Karate Kid,8,Great movie with lots of positive messages  The violence in this movie is not too much for kids to tolerate  Daniel is a great role mode though this movie has some faults  Like the movie writer seems to think that girls are weak and cant defend themselves  One example of this is when Mr  Miygi said to Daniel that he was Punching like a girl  Over all a great movie that has some flaws,6
96312,2904번,The Karate Kid,8,Mr Myagi teaches Daniel Kung Fu so he can defend himself the next time he gets bullied at school  Then Daniel goes to a karate competition and gets hurt really badly in the knee but gets back up  Then in the final round Daniel goes up against the one who shows no mercy for Daniel  His name is Johnny  Daniel does what Mr Myagi taught him and wins,5
96313,2904번,The Karate Kid,8,The Karate Kid is an amazing movie that the whole family  from little kids to grandparents  can enjoy  The violence is little and is used in the Karate scenes and one bullying scene in which you see a little blood  Swearing is also little with only a few bad words such as damn and basterd  The racist term slope is also used  One of our villains Johnny is rolling a joint in one scene but that will fly right over kids heads  There is nothing sexual in the film except for a lengthy kiss  The message in this film is also great and Mr Miyagi is a huge role model,7
96314,2904번,The Karate Kid,8,Ok soooo the actual movie is rated 15 England because of drugs and violence some sexual stuff but highschool era,1
96315,2904번,The Karate Kid,8,A classic movie that is appropriate  for kids This website tends to stretch its reviews so basically most kids can hardly watch anything  I that the goal anyway I think this movie is awesome and any kid can see it maybe not really little kids but otherwise everybody,4
96316,2904번,The Karate Kid,8,I think this is a great movie  But it is still best for older kids  The violence is generally mild but there are bruises on faces a small amount of suggestive themes as well as some use of mild language and less inappropriate insults such as bullst the GD word the D word frigging and bastd  But one thing parents and kids can talk about is not everything is the way it seems  Anyway this is a great movie that I would highly recommend for martial arts fans,4
96317,2904번,The Karate Kid,8,This film has heartwarming moments as the main character Daniel bonds with an unlikely friend and mentor mr Miyagi  Mr Miyagi works as a janitor but he can pull a punch  Having found out that mr Miyagi is a karate master Daniel requests training after numerous beatings by Johnny the school bully who has a black belt in karate  Meanwhile he develops a relationship with Johnnys exgirlfreind Ali  All in all I think this is a suitable film for most ages and in my view the best movie ive ever seen,5
97459,2959번,The Lion King (1994),6,I was watching this movie a little while ago and i said i think i might rewind and watch it again  i think in my life i have watched this movie over 4000 times its soooo good     i would reremend this movie to 5,3
97460,2959번,The Lion King (1994),6,Extremely good yet sad and scary for young kids,1
97461,2959번,The Lion King (1994),6,this movie was really good in 3D but some parts would be too scary for younger kids   like near the end there is some fighting which was kind of scary but it was really good,2
97462,2959번,The Lion King (1994),6,I think its absurd that any parent would find this movie inappropriate for kids above 4  I watched Lord of The Rings when i was 6 and I wasnt scarred for life  I definitely didnt need therapy,3
97463,2959번,The Lion King (1994),6,I think the original Lion King is great,1
97464,2959번,The Lion King (1994),6,The film is good quite a bit of violence and lots of scary scenes but note this film was NOT released 2011  It was released far before that  Its only been rereleased in cinemas  Please get your classics right,4
97465,2959번,The Lion King (1994),6,This is my favorite movieand I  think it is fairly educational because of the animals and naturejust as long your kids are able to understand it,1
97466,2959번,The Lion King (1994),6,I give it a G,1
97467,2959번,The Lion King (1994),6,I like this movie,1
97621,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,Yall really need to lighten up on this movie  Ariel has cleavage but guess what Its barely any its not explicit and shes a 16 year old wearing a shell bra  She has a chest  Grow up  Shes not really a good role model given the whole you need to be pretty to get the guy thing but this is a classic Disney movie made with the classic Disney formula  Cinderella doesnt get the guy until she transforms but I dont see anyone talking bad about her  Anyway the only genuinely iffy thing is basically Ursulas character  She eats live sea creatures in  a scene keep in mind this is basically cannibalism in this world Ursula calls Ariel a tramp when she Ariel is successfully impressing Eric and Ursulas death is actually pretty dark for a Disney movie but nothing your kids probably cant handle  Theres also a scene with a shark at the beginning of the movie  Overall this movie is fine for kids and the parents on this site are honestly ridiculous,11
97622,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,This is a sexylovey doub movie involving Areil and,1
97623,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,The movie that relaunched Disney and started the Disney Renaissance a period where some of the best Disney films are considered to have been made is none other than The Little Mermaid one of the most beloved Disney films made   The story of a young but rebellious teenage mermaid who strikes a deal with an evil sea witch to   ah youll find out   Just make sure you see this one if youre a Disney fan,3
97624,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,This is such a good movie Im probably older than I should be to watch Disney princess movies but nothing will ever beat the Little Mermaid  I wasnt going to write a review but some of the ones I saw  from  overly sensitive parents are ridiculous  There is no way that I would ever want to raise my child in a world where The Little Mermaid is,4
97625,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,one of my favorite Disney movies to date  Great soundtrack some humor and great animation totally worth watching,2
97626,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,I love this movie From the songs to the loveable characters to the hopeless romantics out there  I adored this movie,3
97627,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,Teaches kids to explore the world and there is a lot out there  But there is some innuendo,2
97628,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,This is an AWESOME movie Ariel is a positive role model for everyoneeven boys  She teaches us to stand up for what we believe in  Eric is a positive role model because 1 He is not full of himself 2 During the firebirthday scene he shows that he LOVES his dog Max  He went back into the fire and he risked his life just so he could save Max,5
97629,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,this disney movie has AWFULL role models and a DISGUSTING message  The movie shows ariel disrespecting her father never listening to him and causing trouble she changes herself to be with a prince come on is that really a lesson we want kids to see  and just so you know in the original book where the little mermaid was based on for the movie ariel DIES so this movie is bad please dont show it to your kids changing your body is not a lesson we want to give them,3
97630,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,very scery ursula is very scery i didint even finish it,1
97649,2963번,The Little Mermaid,4,Honestly some of you parents need to calm down  Those who say shes not wearing enough clothes really Shes a mermaid do you expect her to wear a T shirt And as for she liked Eric just for his looks 1  She saw he had a passion for music like she did and 2  When he recieved a statue of himself for his birthday he made a disgusted face showing he wasnt vain or full of himself  The music is absolutely stunning and in no way sexual like some of you freak parents are saying  One of Disneys best movies that I love even though Im almost 13,8
97650,2963번,The Little Mermaid,4,This is one of the fine movies ever  Ariel is good  She reminds me of the time I was swimming during August  Ursula is the witch who has won the lottery  She has Ariels voice for good which is bad for infants  Eric is beautiful He loves Ariel  Flounder is a comedy fish who teases on Scuttle  Fine movie,9
97651,2963번,The Little Mermaid,4,This film sends out a great message that if you set your mind to something you will succeed,1
97652,2963번,The Little Mermaid,4,My fav movie of all time  I watch it all the time and it never gets old  Those kids who think that her outfit has to much cleavage then u should watch ballroom dancing cause that is too much cleavage not Ariels dresses  They are just normal outfits  And this movie is one of the best classics out there  I know her songs by heart and know all the lines  I say this movie should be for all ages because it has a lesson learn some risk in life are worth taken that is the real moral and that what the creators of the little mermaid was going for  Unlike mordern Disney movies The Little Mermaid touches hearts of ppl of all ages  It has that sort of spark to it please let your kids see the movie  They would love it  I know I did when I first saw it and I still love it,11
97653,2963번,The Little Mermaid,4,The Little Mermaid is like a SAW cartoon,1
97654,2963번,The Little Mermaid,4,I LOVE the Little Mermaid But when I was reading the reviews I noticed that some parents find that Ariels clothing choice isnt good  I mean really Do you want her to go around in a turtle neck I think you all are over protective of your kids they have to grow up sometime  You probably dont even let them watch Elmo  They probably have to watch the movie on ABCs all the time  Come on This is a great movie Ariel is a strong young woman who inspires girls to do what they believe in  Its either this or what they will find out online  Disney wouldnt make any movies too scary,12
97655,2963번,The Little Mermaid,4,why does everyone thinks its inappropiate 17 and older really this movie is for 6 year olds it does not teach girls to show off their bodies shes a mermaid what else is she going to wear a Tshirt this is a good movie for little kids if your daughter watches this its not like theyll what their belly button showing and what to wear tight clothes parents are to picky about what there child watches,1
97656,2963번,The Little Mermaid,4,this is a great movie for kids but my daughter always want to be like ariel lol,1

97803,2988번,The Man from Snowy River,8,Review The Man from Snowy River,1
97804,2988번,The Man from Snowy River,8,I recall watching this with my family multiple times as a child and loving the idea that this movie presents  There is some swearing which was a little unnecessary but I never picked up on it as a kid and only realized the cussing when I last rewatched it  There are a few kisses Three I think which never bothered me or my family but it may others  A few of the characters get drunk but are so tipsy that they only made a fool of themselves and the main character Jim looks down on them so it is not seen as a good thing  another character smokes a cigarrete but the result is having horse dung thrown on his shoe and is also shown as a bad thing and Jim tells him something smart about how stupid the choice to smoke was,5
97805,2988번,The Man from Snowy River,8,One time in the movie a guy calls a nother guy a basterd,1
98801,3015번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,Other reviewers have already given a good overview but I have a few notes to add,1
98802,3015번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,This is a FANTASTIC movie to watch as a family it really shows deeply people need to unplug from media and is well made  Some of the song choices are    odd and also ONE ANNOYING THING THE KIDS VOICE SOUNDS LIKE AN ADULT  THIS LITTLE BOY SOUNDS LIKE HE IS 30,4
98803,3015번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,It uses a basic premise and mixes it with an innovative animation style a few character dynamics and tropes that arent seen in cinema often and a realistic family conflict,1
98804,3015번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,I lovee this movie  Its very funny  A few tears of laughter may escape you  It is perfect to see with the family,4
98805,3015번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,First off this movie has great representation of LGBTQ people with the main character being hinted as lesbian through the movie finally revealing at the end of the movie Also Autism representation The son is likely to be autistic although it is never actually said  with extreme obsessions with dinosaurs and misunderstanding social cues  Also the movie critiques consumerism and capitalism in the digital age through hilarious gags,4
98806,3015번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,When I thought about watching this I was sorta like OMG this is going to be 35 stars  BUT I was WRONG This thrilling animated adventure about a family surviving through the robot appocalypse is a beautiful example of teamwork scifi and comedy  Buckle your seat belt for hilarious actionsequences and one crazy family as they drive across the country to save the world,4
98807,3015번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,The Mitchells vs the Machines was a really amazing animated film  It had great characters and the animation was absolutely refined  Surprisingly the film was made by the same studio that made The Emoji Movie  I recommend this for ages 10 and up because some scenes can be frightening to some viewers  Just wow,5
98808,3015번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,Well for a movie enthusiast who loves watching all sorts of films would say this TRULY is one best movies Ive Seen In Years The Mitchells vs the Machines is a Great Funny Family Film that would be great for all AGES  I think even as a 14 year old I find this film better than most of the Pixar Movies  It truly is a MustSee Film to Watch,4
99092,3037번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,I watched this since I was like 5 but it scared me until I was 12  I was seriously horrified and couldnt watch this is Halloween without having nightmares for weeks  Now as a 14 year old I love all the tim burton movies with my whole heart,3
99093,3037번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,its fine   I like how its stopmotion and that its directed by henrey selik who also directed Coraline aka the greatest most amazing beautiful emotional fantastic masterpeice which im watching right now   In other words go watch Coraline instead,3
99094,3037번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,The Nightmare before Christmas is such a great Tim Burton movie and for those who says its scary inappropriate and creepy youre crazy  Rebecca Spark is Crazybutt This film has the incredible luxury of being a holiday film that is viewable for TWO different holidays or year round if you desire  It is shown on TV during October and December and occasionally November as well  Been heard of Henry Selick directed this movie he also directed Coraline  I saw it since when I was 7 watching Haunted Mansion holiday and I watched both Henry Selick films  Even I watched Corpse Bride I drew both Emily and Sally and both are Tim Burton  Holly R have been a fan of watching this movie since she was 5 and it was still newish  It takes a special kind of smaller child to not feel scared of everything in todays world but this has just the right amount of scares and humor  Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King and a mascot for Halloween who is becoming tired of the same old Halloween stuff every year  He stumbles across the world of Christmas and becomes intrigued by Santa and all the happiness that is in Christmas so he decides that he wants to be Santa  Its a fun spooky and jolly holiday movie with a Oogie Boogie Man who isnt really scary because he is just a sackbag that has eyes and a mouth  He has bugs inside his body  He might scare very sensitive children but if your kids are not sensitive and can handle similar movies like Corpse Bride then by all means this is for them  The stopmotion animation is great good plot great music cool ghoul characters and some characters are good role models especially Sally  I like when he explains Christmas  My favorite scene is when Fanfavorite Jack disguises as Sandy Claus and pranks all children for presents  Its funny Though Disney plus have parental guidance when you played the movie  I have a art teacher who is a fan of Tim Burton  I recommend for ages 7 because of some scenes can be frightening for sensitive younger viewers but older can handle it  Great Tim Burton,22
99095,3037번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,This movie has a great story and great animation  It has a tad bit of violence but other than that it is a wonderful film  The characters are great and the story is perfect  This is one of Disneys best films  No language or anything inappropriate  Great film over all,6
99096,3037번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,Parents need to know that unlike most Tim Burton films this movie is for kids  Some stuff that might creep out kids such as ripping off arms spiders bats and monsters  One character opens up his head  Wonderful family movie,4
99097,3037번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,There is nothing wrong with it and the claymation is beautiful  the main character does try to steal christmas but sees the error of his ways   The people in halloween town are all monsters but none of them are scary  the main character is a skeleton and he takes off his head once or twice,4
99098,3037번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,Really good movie,1
99099,3037번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,This is a great movie but kinda gross  Theres a song at the start the shows a load of creepy deformed monsters singing about Halloween  Good movie but 5 and below need to wait one or two years for some of it,3
99100,3037번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,Good thing it was rated PG   It was scarier than I thought   Kids should be 8 to watch it alone 7 to watch it with an adult   If kids dont like scary stuff then dont watch this movie,4
99484,3047번,The Office,7,This show is possibly the best comedy ever There is light cursing damn hell bitch ass crap and there are a few drug references Dwight finds a joint in the parking lot Ryan gets addicted to cocaine both are played for laughs lots of sex references and talk of genitals and finally a small amount of violence  Its all played for laughs but some younger kids could imitate some of the dumb stuff Michael Dwight and Andy do  Jump off a building into a box throw scissors at each other throw watermelon at cars off the top of a building  The show is hilarious and I would 100 recommend it to anyone,5
99485,3047번,The Office,7,often offensive show that holds up in some areas and plunges head first in others  your child has to be mature enough to understand the weight of some of the jokes and has to know that many of the jokes are offensive and that some of the actual beliefs behind the jokes are dangerous to actually believe in,2
99486,3047번,The Office,7,The Office is a great show  There are a fair number of inappropriate jokes and references so if you were going to watch solo I would recommend for 12  However if an adult will watch with you I would okay it for 1011 year olds as well  My 10 year old sister and I watched it with our mom and it was fine  However before letting your 10 year old watch it you should know that there are several thats what she said jokes as well as a few about race and sex there are several references to sex and having sex one of the characters Meredith is an alcoholic some characters smoke and there is some language  Anything too inappropriate is bleeped out but there are damns and dammits as well as a few other not so nice words  If none of the above is an issue for you then great let your kid watch The Office,7
99487,3047번,The Office,7,My brother used to watch The office before after it leaves Netflix USA at the end of the year and its available on peacock now  I watched it because its not that badly after they talk about sex theres swearing like sort of st nor maybe some dirty stuff words but some F bombs may be use in this show right now  OK for 14 or 15 should be watchin this,3
99488,3047번,The Office,7,I love this show and think that it is totally appropriate to kids 13 and up  But it is a bit awkward to watch with parents,2
99489,3047번,The Office,7,Most mature jokes just go over your head  Some episodes are inappropriate with sx jokes and racy jokes but overall its an amazing comedy romance and family show,2
99490,3047번,The Office,7,I love this show but there are some not safe for work  jokes however Evan though my rating says 12 but it really depends if your child has been through 7th grade health  education,1
99491,3047번,The Office,7,This is the absolute funniest show Ive ever seen the characters are relatable yet hilarious great plotlines for a comedy lots of  great improvision starts to decline once sabre purchases Dunder Mifflin still hilarious ending was great,1
99492,3047번,The Office,7,iffy but funny and good,1
100889,3080번,The Polar Express,6,This was not a good movie  I watched it as a teenager and even found it too creepy I would think little kids would be terrified  It is very unrealistic the conductor is mean and irresponsible and it included many unnecessarily scary sceens ghost on roof puppet room train out of control lost ticket even the beginning with the shaking as the train arrives  Our family watched it thinking it would be a cheerful and holiday movie for young children but it was creepy   Not even the elves were cute The only thing that was relatively sweet about the movie was the friendship between the three kids and the messages of kindness and friendship  I wasnt scared but I would imaging young children would be quite scared its not a good movie for little kids  I would recommend that nobody regardless of age watch the movie,8
100890,3080번,The Polar Express,6,This movie is a great movie for all ages it shows all the importance in christmas than  just getting gifts  and santa  Christmas is jesuss birthday and should teach you the importance in family life,2
100891,3080번,The Polar Express,6,in the boys house there is never light just dark and the train is way too loud  Please dude gimme a better movie,2
100892,3080번,The Polar Express,6,This film contains positive messages role models  THE POLAR EXPRESS is a fun movie for kids aged 6 and up,2
100893,3080번,The Polar Express,6,You shouldnt be worried about this AT all no bad language no other stuff and any intended scariness is just yelling with anger  This was the first movie I watched when I was 2 and I still love it Great role models and messages of the right thing to do not only for yourself but to help other people too,3
100894,3080번,The Polar Express,6,I love the positive message and the roles that family play in this film   I loved the characters and the story about traveling on an express train to the north pole and going through some twist and turns just to be the first kid ever to receive the first gift,2
100895,3080번,The Polar Express,6,My all time favorite christmas movie,2
100896,3080번,The Polar Express,6,This is the best Christmas movie ever Me and my family watch this every year  I always feel like I am on Christmas Eve night when I watch this movie and it makes every kid ready for the night before Christmas  It teaches a lesson about how you do not need to see something to believe in it  You should believe in something because you feel it is right  It also teaches the true meaning of Christmas and shows the time spent with family and all the Christmas activities  This is my favorite movie ever I would recommend this to everyone Please give yourself a great Christmas treat and go watch it right now,9
100897,3080번,The Polar Express,6,greatest movie ever great christmas film for little kids  five stars up but only at christmastime,4
101333,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,This movie is not remotely bad  The stakes are always high and Wesley the protagonist befriends many previous enemies including Inigo Montoya who is out for revenge  His father was killed by a man with six fingers on one hand  He practices a phrase every day  Wesley also befriends Fezzick a giant man who helps Wesley in every way possible  Princess Buttercup is being forced to marry against her will so Wesley Inigo and Fezzick go on a long quest to rescue her from Prince Humperdink and the six fingered man  There is no swearing but there is a small amount of drinking,7
101334,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,I will say  I get scared easily by movies  But I think that this movie has too much violence  Bad people put a good man into a torture machine the princess is planning to commit suicide a man sticks a knife into anothers stomach This movie gave me nightmares for a while after I saw it   Not a bad movie unless youre too young when you watch it and then its just awful,4
101335,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,This movie is one of my favorites Its not to violent and its great Barely to little sex a man makes a comment about a princesss breasts will go over kids heads the swearing is very mild Jesuss name is misused once briefly    Son of a btch used once  I would say WITH PARENTS a six year old could watch it  Keep in mind its rated PG,7
101336,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,Very entertaining and funny  Quite a lot of kissing though,2
101337,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,This is one of the best movies of all time Cary Elwes is the BEST in this movie  Other than men in tights If anything I would say its kind of violent  In the Fire Swamp the princess dress gets on fire but it is quickly put out with nobody injured  In the same scene Wesley Cary Elwes is attacked by an ROUSRodent of unusual size and bit twice by a giant rat that might seem a little scarey  Once in the arm and another time in the shoulder  He screams in pain and eventually sets the rat on fire  It moans and Wesley stabs it three times to put it out of its misery  Wesley and the princess share quite a few passionate kisses  A bad guy is poisoned but it is very silly   Lots of talk of torture  One reference to the princess breasts  Iningo Montoya gets stabbed at least three times  Then he stabs his enemy at least three times and kills him  Two torture scenes in the pit of despair  Son of a btch is used once  God a few times  All of this may sound bad but its not  Its also a FANTASTIC  MOVIE,20
101338,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,Many people have told me that The Princess Bride was perfect the best film of all time and a classic  Did it live up to the hype For me it did not  On a technical basis it could have been improved  One of the biggest problems I had with this film was the pacing  By that I mean how elaborate it was  When Buttercup and Wesley were reunited we get to see more of their relationship but that quickly ends and kinds of sabotages the romance which is not good since this is kind of a romance film  The next problem I had with the movie was the consistency of tone  At one point of the movie it was very kidfriendly then towards the end it got bloody  I questioned if I was still watching the same movie and this problem was one of my biggest issues with the movie Hook  I might be coming off as a hater of The Princess Bride but I assure you I dont hate this movie  I really enjoyed the comedy the movie had some solid performances and characters the movie had a cool story of rescuing and the swordfights were choreographed really well  Ill give The Princess Bride a 6 510  I was underwhelmed by this movie and I was hoping to give the movie an 1010  This kind of thing happens from time to time  I recommend The Princess Bride to children mostly,16
101339,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,This is an unbelievable movie and so good  However there are two sword fights one which involves quite a few cuts and stabs and the eels might scare some young children  Some of the humor is a little adult and there are a few instances of mild swearing  Allinall though it is an amazing movie that anyone over 8 will absolutely love,4
101340,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,This was a pretty good movie  It was REALLY funny at some parts  It was strange because some parts felt to fast and others to slow  The romance was nice but it was definitely fairytale Not real  I didnt really feel or see any personality in the characters  buttercup was a damsel in distress who sort was just there to be rescued  Westley had personality and I liked him well enough  the three bad guys two who werent really bad were fun  I didnt really see the point in the prince wanting to kill buttercup I think it was another part of the damsel in distress thing  But I really did like the movie,10
101341,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,Great film that is a different kind of princess story but still so much fun to watch  Funny and exciting I recommend this movie to all children 6 and up,2
101352,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,Princess Bride was one of those movies I kept hearing about and it seems you arent a real movie buff unless you watch it  I can tell its infinitely quotable to those who grew up watching it but the enormous rats even scared me so kids above 10 should have no problem seeing it  Very clever especially with the hilarious Andre the Giant,3
101353,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,The Princess Bride is an 80s classic for good reason   its nearly perfect  Our protagnist is Buttercup a young woman who loves to torment her farm boy Westley   who only replies As you wish to her every command  Later she realizes he loves her and she loves him too  When Westley is sent to war and killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts Buttercup grieves  An evil prince takes advantage of this by choosing her for his bride  However shes kidnappedand a villain named Vizzini attempts to murder her but the Dread Pirate Roberts saves her  Buttercup is annoyed because of what happened to Westley but why does he seem so familiarThere is lots of sword fighting and the scene in the fire swamp might be intense for the youngest viewers  A use of son of a b is used and as Buttercup contemplates suicide Westely mentions her perfect breasts  The comedy in this movie along with the action the romance and the fantays make it a big success  I particulary enjoy Billy Crystal as the wizard Andre the Giant as Fezzik the giant and Wallace Shawn as the evil Vizini,10
101354,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,I thought it wasnt a very good movie but it had a good plot line  Although it would be a great movie for children there was a couple of moments in the movie where there was some language and really spoiled the movie  Therefore I think that you should not be allowed to watch this if you are 7 or under and should think about the person if they are under 10,3
101355,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,Respect for the classics,1
101356,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,I absolutely loved this movie I recommend for anyone to watch it,1
101357,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,This is my favorite movie I love it because there is mostly harmless sword fighting a giant R O U S s rodents of unusual size lots of humorous and quotable one liners,3
101358,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,I think this movie is very good but in the end there is some blood and violenceand there are some rodents of unusual size wich attack Wesley,1
101359,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,I love this movie and i think it is great for anyone of any age that are not to scared of giant rats,1
101360,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,As stated at the title  There are a few things I like better about the movie than the book is that you can actually hear what the priest sounds like  Dont mark this as inappropriate but he sounds like hes been kicked in the groan I dont know what else to call that,3
101361,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,I really like the princess bride  its fun and adventurous  And I also like Westly and Buttercup   its very funny to me   ALERT  caution this movie is awesome   Why I think you should only watch this movie if your 10 or over is because when I watch it I have to skip a few parts because I am not allowed to see them  But one time I saw a few parts that I can not see by accident,7
101552,3095번,The Proposal,6,I personally loved this movie  There are lots of curs words and rude words but a young child wouldnt understand that  At first i was worried it would be inapropriette but it wasnt   There is one seen when are stars collide because one is getting out of shower and one in to the shower  Biut i still all around LOVE this movie,6
101553,3095번,The Proposal,6,This hilarious romcom is perfect and funny for teens of all ages,1
101554,3095번,The Proposal,6,The problem with The Proposal is on its story and plot  Its just plain predictable  You can figure out how the movie is gonna end right in the first minutes,3
101555,3095번,The Proposal,6,Haha I like this comedy movie This is not for kids   it shows naked woman and man bumped each other on the side  There are kissing    but very funny,4
101556,3095번,The Proposal,6,i watched this and laughed soo hard and just loved the movie the only thing wz i wz watching it with my boy cuzzin who is as old as me and in the scene where they fall accidentally on each other naked was too awkward but overall a rlly good romanceCOMEDY,2
101557,3095번,The Proposal,6,The movie is greatandvery interesting  I enjoyed it however the crash though unnessacary showed no sensitive body parts so younger children probably wouldnt even understand it  Overall a brilliant movie,3
101558,3095번,The Proposal,6,WOW This movie is awesome There is a bit of nudity but nothing sensitive is shown  The woods scene with the grandmother is hilarious and it was super funny  I liked the movie any mature 12 year old would love this movie,5
101559,3095번,The Proposal,6,Not for kids,1
101560,3095번,The Proposal,6,This is a great and funny movie  It made me laugh all the way through it even at sad parts because they made it seem awkwardly funny  It had great characters and a very good story line  Might be inappropriate for some viewers though,4
102506,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,I liked this movie  Its funny and has funny stuff about pets  I liked how the main character had flaws and they all learned stuff,3
102507,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,I was expecting to watch a great movie for kids  What I actually saw was trash  This movie was so boring and the characters were really stupid and annoying,3
102508,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,The movie awesome and most kids likely elementary  up should handle it  There are a few dark messages about death and killing the rabbit character has the personality of murder but it doesnt get to intense  One scary scene most kids may be scared of is when the viper tries to bite Max  Duke Gidget has a serious crush on max but it isnt sexual A bird tries to kill Gidget but they becomes friends shortly afterward overall the movie is good,3
102509,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,The movie has good scenery and animation and teaches kids what others have been through  The story is great itself and has good characters,2
102510,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,If you have seen the trailer youve seen everything  The beginning starts of well and interesting but as it carries on you sit there feeling like you are wasting your time  So many stupid and unconvincing things occur  Very disappointed only the beginning is funny  The good bits are all in the trailer,5
102511,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,Several bad language uses    for older kids it is awesome,1
102512,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,This is the best movie ever with amazing characters and lots and lots and lots and lots of humor   This adventure would be best for kids who like animals and adventurous tales,2
102513,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,Its quite entertaining  I loved seeing this movie the first time it was released,2
102514,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,It is awesome especially if you are a pet lover I enjoyed it very much,1
102515,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,I heard words like shut up and  loser  The story was just rescue something,2
103475,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,I watched this when I was 9  It was funny  ,3
103476,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,I have seen this movie and we have it but this movie is very inappropriate lots of sex language and drinking and smoking  Barts private area is shown and of course bad language  Bart is the most main offender in this movie  Violence as well Lisa punches him  The most beautiful I saw in this movie was the wedding video there was this once scene that Homer and Marge not seen have a sex reference not in their bed being naked having no clothes on  Otherwise concerning film,6
103477,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,GREAT MOVIE But is inappropriate at most times and its mostly because of violence and sex,2
103478,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,Very good better than the orignial tv show  The only really bad thing is the penis shot shown for 3 and a half secondsI tracked and the rest is fine,2
103479,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,The Simpsons Movie as funny as it is is not for some kids  There is offensive stuff but make sure your kid can ignore the bad stuff  There is fighting but no blood beside Itchy and Scratchy cartoonish  Homer as normal loves beer  There are sexual references and a scene which implies sex  But nothing is graphic  There is language D A S B  There is some gun use  In the end Homer becomes a hero after learning to be less selfish and a better father to Bart,9
103480,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,homer is a positive role model drinking in a bar       your kids will look up to him and bart when he skateboards naked,1
103481,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,I really like this movie  Its very funny and entertaining  But there are stuff to watch out for  Bart can be seen skateboarding naked Bart also drinks later in the movie there is mild use of bad language and there is evidence of violence as seen during the angry mob scene  Its good but it is more explicit than the cartoon,5
103482,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,| and ,1
103483,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,The Simpsons Movie is a pretty awsome film for comical people aged 10  above  If your child is under that age some parts are a little unsuitable with some cheeky humour  Is it suitable for kids mostly yes  But like I said not all of it is perfectly suitable,4
103484,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,Swears only come every once in a while in the show but overall its usually only says B but not that often  Anyway it is a suitable show for kids 9 and up,2
103845,3158번,The Simpsons,7,bad things include,1
103846,3158번,The Simpsons,7,I think this is the best show anywhere it is very funny  It may make you feel uncomfortable watching with your parents because of some of the things they say and very rarely show  Other than that I would say it is great for a 1011 year old  My parents are very strict but they allow me to watch it with my 9 year old brother  I definitely recommend this show no matter what people say,5
103847,3158번,The Simpsons,7,Older tweens and teens would be fine with the sex references and the language in The Simpsons  My 9 year old sister is fine with it so I would say around 10 and up,2
103848,3158번,The Simpsons,7,great show for all ages,1
103849,3158번,The Simpsons,7,I Personally Love This Show And The Rewatch Rate is 110 out of 100 there is lots of drinking BUT it shows you how bad things happen when you drink to much there is cussing but nothing horrible  just the d word the b word occasionally and the a word,1
103850,3158번,The Simpsons,7,This is the best family friendly show ever There is a bit of sex and stuff but if your kid is mature then most episodes will be fine,2
103851,3158번,The Simpsons,7,I guess it is entertaining but  who wants to watch yellow people be slobs,1
103852,3158번,The Simpsons,7,SO FUNNY,1
103980,3158번,The Simpsons,8,The Simpsons is a great show  As soon as my dad showed it to me I thought it was the best show ever   Its not hard to believe that there are over 30 seasons It is a little inappropriate at times but not bad enough to influence kids behavior  Come on were not dumbies,5
103981,3158번,The Simpsons,8,This isnt the best show Ive ever seen but its one of them and is definitely the funniest,1
103982,3158번,The Simpsons,8,Sometimes quite sexual  But most of the time its fine  Homer gets drunk ALOT and there is also the town drunk too  Homer also strangles Bart frequently,4
103983,3158번,The Simpsons,8,Its great for families,1
103984,3158번,The Simpsons,8,I love watching the older seasons of the Simpsons every night with my family  There are mild swear words that 1012 year olds can definitely handle  They may be some kissy kissy stuff but its never shown   The jokes can be dark or mature but most jokes are all so funny  Good for tweens and older ,6
103985,3158번,The Simpsons,8,Hello simpsons fans and others,1
103986,3158번,The Simpsons,8,This content GOOD,1
103987,3158번,The Simpsons,8,The Simpsons has been running for so long and is still going strong,1
103988,3158번,The Simpsons,8,The Simpsons is an awesome TVshow to watch it is age appropriate and it is not like Family Guy  So if your child wants to watch  it  Then that would be a good idea  As long as it doesnt curse a lot in your TV  Have fun watching this show,5
103989,3158번,The Simpsons,8,i think ages 6 513  would start  understanding you see im 8 i understand the jokes,1
105116,3178번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,I watched this movie alone  I really enjoyed it even if im 14  I think this movie is OK to watch with kids though there are some scary moments and some of them may get scared  It has great messages,4
105117,3178번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,I watched this movie when I was 7 or 8 and I do not recommend doing so  For what it was rated I think that it definitely should of been at least m pg13 great to watch with older kids,2
105118,3178번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,Sword Fights people getting hit by cars an evil ogre threatening someones family kidnapping a character gets a bloody injury on their knee which requires medical attention that they dont have but it miraculously turns out better  Otherwise good fantasy movie for 9 and 10 yearolds which positive messages,2
105119,3178번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,I loved this movie when I watched it as a kid it has some heavy fantasy themes and some creepy undertones  Some parts of the movie could be distressing for younger viewers ex  Bloody bites and scratches fighting off comical goblins with knives and tomato soup ect  But most intense things that do happen are kind of ridiculous  Things  do take a dark turn at the end though with the main character having to make peace with the death of his father by stabbing a monster that has taken on the form of his father in order to make him let his guard down  Overall I think The Spiderwick Chronicles is a great movie for older audiences or more mature kids,6
105120,3178번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,The violence is honestly not a problem  Its all just animated stuff and any kid above 10 can take it,2
105121,3178번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,I just went back and watched this movie Im 15 now but back when I first watched it age 7 it was amazing and introduced me to the Fae and Faeries  I think its very cool that there is a movie about the Fae  It even includes tons of facts about them  Now for the kids as long as your not coddling them then it should be fine,4
105122,3178번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,Look first up the rumor about the dad getting stabbed in the chest was not true but I wont deny he got stabbed in the hand  Now comes the blood there was barely any blood in it except wounds similar to the ones that kids get every week by playing outside  Of course if you plan on letting a kid younger that 9 watch then make sure hell be able to handle it there is a a little bit of fear the goblins are trying to break the circle and the twin is taken away getting pulled by the legs if you watch the full movie kids will get the idea that its never too late to make things right Jared Grace was rude to his mother but in the end apologized  That also when people seem like they are lying they are right so not to judge or jump to conclusions Jared discovered the world and no one believed him which put his family in potential danger  It also gives the trust your gut message because while the decisions he made could have involved pain and scariness and a lot of risk his gut said he was right and he was,5
105123,3178번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,pretty violent  my sister ran out of the house screaming because of the blood and screaming when they got scratched,2
105124,3178번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,There is a giant goblin and he would definitely scare little kids he is in a lot of scenes and they have a big fight and he stabs the goblin,1
106141,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,I watched this film when it first came out  And what I watched in that hour and a half was kinda disturbing  For starters in one scene they imagined ways of their parents dying  They send their parents away and every time they go somewhere on the map someone always dies  And theyre always seen kissing with disgusting exaggerated noises playing while their doing it  The neglect they have for their kids is AWFUL They actually throw one of them into a coal bin  Overall the film is shocking and appalling,8
106142,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,I thought this movie was pretty good   until it got cruel  There are cruel parents the kids try to kill them and it mentions cannibalism  Tho its good   if you arent disturbed  No judgement  I love this movie Just a but cruel there also is good stuff They stick together as siblings there are rainbows candy and magic  Tho I forgot to mention it got a bit sexual do to the scenes where the father did this thing with his neck to mother   overall great movie but think about your kids age first  Also you may laugh a dangerous amount 12  definitely tho,10
106143,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,The movie starts of on a bad note with the oldest boy Tim gets put in the hallway when he was a BABY which is so wrong  It has a very up and down middle Tim has a sister and twin brothers the kids dont really get fed unless the steal it and quite possibly the worstweirdest part of it all is the way the parents act they kiss ALL THE TIME and the dad he doesnt act like a father does this weird thing where he makes a cat noise to his wife  The best part was the last half hour,3
106144,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,This movie is good I cant really say perfect because of some downfalls but lets talk about the good stuff first The reason why I placed the age rating as age 8 or older is because my 8year old sister got to watch this with my older brother parents and of course me  Why would I be writing this review if I never watched the movie anyways OK on to the point  Good stuff the middle child Jane is a kind and amazing girl  Proof She didnt want to leave the orphan baby that was in a box near the Willoughby house alone  She wanted to find her a home  Next Tim the oldest at least I think it was Tim has some good values in him  Proof While with the nanny Linda and his siblings they walked over to the place where Jane left the orphan child  He told the nanny not to ring the doorbell otherwise she would disturb the man who lives theres work  Next the four siblings still want to give their horrible parents a second chance saying that they forgive them but they literally dont have to love them while they are still their parents but they freeze at the end  Now lets go to the bad stuff  The kids want their parents to die because they were such bad parents  They imagined them getting eaten by bears sharks and burning too and many more  The parents act so sexual with each other if I actually said it right  Tim judges the nanny because of reading her messages thinking that she has something bad to do to them since she works for their parents  I feel like thats a very bad thing because you cant always judge a person because of this and that  So he makes a thing called a nannypult or a catapult to literally THROW the nanny out of the window  While the childs parents are gone they make a mess all around the house  Do we really want our kids doing these things But behind all these downfalls there are always some good things  Im not really sure if thats all so thats all the information Im giving to the person whos reading this right now  Funny thing this actually also makes parents learn a lesson which is to take care of their children  You dont want them thinking about you as demons and monsters and all of that drama  I think you should watch the movie if I were to make a choice  If I were a parent Id explain to my children that this is just a movie and that its all drama and acting so they dont really have to copy everything a character in it does especially bad stuff  But if you are a CHILD reading this take your parents advice  Easy Thats my advice for you and sorry if I sounded a little harsh at the end  PS This movie is kinda like Matilda and if you dont know what that movie is watch it or look it up on Common Sense Media again its like Matilda but without the principal which kinda makes it more appropriate,31
106145,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,This movie was very funny and over all fantastic it was a little bit dark at some points as the children try to kill their parents but in a comedic way  The parents kiss a lot  But just funny over all,3
106146,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,I recommend this,1
106147,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,this movie was moving and dark  i would not recommend for young children this movie represents neglectful parents and misrepresents social services  the parents acted as though they would be better off without the children and refused to feed care and love the children  Sure there were some positive messages like that you should stick with our family and that there are people who will care about you   But other that that it focused on the fact that the children thought that their parents would care for them even after years of mistreatment and neglect,5
106148,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,This movie is really funny,1
106149,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,I think its good and its like I guess its like a really good movie so I really think its a movie for the whole family so yeah I hope everyone agrees with me about this movie its really good,1
106150,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,It is an amazing movie I wanna watch it again Actually Ive watched it two times  Cause it so cool  Netflix has made a great achievement  Its one of the best movies that it has made  Another person said it was a horror movie  I dont what that person is talking about But its their opinion  I aint judging,9
106151,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,It was a great movie with lots of laughs for the whole family,2
106152,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,Just no  I get that its supposed to be funny but its actually really dark and weird and sad  Its not good,3
106153,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,I am new to Netflix and I have a strange phobia of movies this is the perfect movie to fall asleep to and I find the twins the contrary of creepy The story has beautiful animation my mum is a producer and the theme of candy gives it more  Must Watch,3
106154,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,It was painful to watch  The whole time I was uncomfortable and kept thinking of how its such a bad example and influence for kids  The main characters cause many destructive car crashes think up ways of how to kill their abusive parents and injure innocent people viewing their home thats up for sale   Not to mention its extremely weird random and disjointed  My family agreed that we wished we could erase it from our minds and kept wanting to turn it off although ended up watching the whole thing  Worst movie Ive ever seen  Even worse than Cats and thats saying something ,7
106155,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,I loved this movie  I thought the plot was really good and it had lots of positive messages about family  I thought this was stopmotion but then I thought it was 3D animated  Could someone please tell me if it was animated or not There is mild themes such as being an orphan and unloving parents  Violence such as a monster popping out but mostly slapstick violence  No language whatsoever  The word is What the Willoughby,8
106156,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,Probably could go without the parents getting eaten at the end and its really weird but its a good movie to watch for a preteen,1
106157,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,I am not older than 15 but I say this movie would not apply for people under that age  In the start of the movie there is a    sound and reference to having babies    The parents are very inappropriate  and the kids set a bad example because they imagine their placenta being killed  Not for kids,4
106158,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,This movie is about some kids who try to get rid of their parents to get a normal family  I liked it because it was funny  It also had good actors,3
106159,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,Look I am older than eight and I didnt like the movie at all Maybe I shouldnt have watched it at night but it is still very sad and I couldnt sleep because of it  I stayed up until midnight because I felt my family didnt love me  Maybe you will read this and think about watching this movie  Also the first movie I hate  Thank you,6
106160,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,At the end where the bad parents are at the beach they got eaten that gave me nightmares for all my life,1
106211,3256번,The Witches,8,I personally think it depends on if you get quite scared at movies easily or not when your young if not I think its a great movie I still love it to this day if not maybe wait until your a little bit older ,1
106212,3256번,The Witches,8,This movie is really good For me It wasnt scary AT ALL just weird but my 17 yr old brother was terrified I guess it just depends on the person  Thing that disturbed me Mouse in dinner  Ok i think its just me but thats kinda gross    Thing that disturbed me Naked Luke at the end  It was blurred but you could tell what it was    I recommend but depends on the person,7
106213,3256번,The Witches,8,There is no bad language in this film although it is easy to mistake witch for something else,1
106214,3256번,The Witches,8,it is very much disturbing so please parents maybe dont let your younger child watch it when the witch takes off her mask it reveals a very disturbing looking face which used to haunt me first time I watched this movie I was about 5 my grandma put it on and I was very traumatised but now as a teen it hasnt disturbed me,1
106215,3256번,The Witches,8,I first watched this when I was 7yrs old and I needed the toilet in the middle of the movie and when I was going there and back I ran soooo fast because I was scared that one of the witches was there,1
106216,3256번,The Witches,8,My Rating PG,1
106217,3256번,The Witches,8,If you want to watch the witches then watch 2020 but still it gave me nightmares for years and also both movies are really pushing it that Witches are real just watch the 2020 trailer in the beginning it says Withes are real and they are among us,1
106218,3256번,The Witches,8,This film is actually scary no joke,1
106219,3256번,The Witches,8,This movie is definitely for those families who want to watch scary movies but nothing intense you know  I totally recommend this movie for everyone,3
106220,3256번,The Witches,8,Honestly this movie wasnt that scary to me  It was really just disturbing  Theres nudity  What kind of kids thriller shows a naked little boy Not an appropriate one  This movie would be very frightening to maybe a 12yr old  Not me  But is very disturbing  When the head witch and all the other witches go to their true form its gross  Good movie but not for kids,10
106630,3290번,Thor,8,I love this movie It is a great one of the first MCU movies you should show your kids,1
106631,3290번,Thor,8,Why is this only 12 plus I think that the main form of violence was just in a bit of martial arts and Thors hammer creating storms  There was a point where a robot shot heat at them and flipped over a bunch of cars  There was no swearing that I can recall there was one kiss that was about it  Great special effects a few comedy moments and an amazing plot  I loved this movie and I think you will to,6
106632,3290번,Thor,8,It is funny and has some fighting but it is still not scary,1
106633,3290번,Thor,8,Thor is an interesting idea  To spin Norse mythology into a superhero film is a challenging risk but it paid off  The change of an impulsive and ignorant son to a loving and strong leader is astonishing  Nothing really bad but some action violence non gory and one character gets drunk  Who doesnt love Loki Seriously  Go watch Thor and the rest of the MCU,7
106634,3290번,Thor,8,has actionviolence throughout,1
106635,3290번,Thor,8,Thor is kinda thicc but could be thiccer  Thor and Spooderman have a cool battle and almost kill each other  Sexy squidward tries to kiss Thor but does not get to  This is a ok movie that could be a little thiccer,4
106636,3290번,Thor,8,marvel has made another great  action pact movie but its about gods  All in all this is a great action movie with very little fighting and some kissing  For violence  there are fight scenes  Frost giants throw ice spikes and attempt to stab people with ice  when touched by a ice giant some of there skin turn purple  Someone does get stabbed  The frost giant leader almost kills oden  but loki blasts him away with a beam  Loki attempts to kill thor with a metal suit that shoots energy beams there are exploding cars but no gets killed  At one point there is blood on thors face  In the beginning thor gets tazed by a girl  thor beats of a bunch of S H I E L D agents there is no blood  There is one big kiss at the end and thor is shown shirtless not sexually  All in all this is a great movie that your 11 year old needs to see at some point in hisher life,13
106637,3290번,Thor,8,ok movie but good for younger kids who cant watch other marvel movies yet,1
106638,3290번,Thor,8,Great movie but extremely violent and kind of scary  I saw it because I always watch things above my age,2
107046,3318번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,This movie isnt as good as Japanese Futa,1
107047,3318번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,This film first caught my eye when I was watching the preview of the movie on the 2012 Diamond Edition DVD of Cinderella 1950 at my friends cabin  I saw this magical film for the first time in 2020 and loved it This fourth installment is about Tinker Bell meeting her fraternal twin sister Periwinkle even though they cant meet each other because the Winter Woods is too cold for warm fairies and the warmer seasons of Pixie Hollow are too hot for winter fairies  Preschoolers could be in suspense when Queen Clarion says that if the freeze spreads around Pixie Hollow Life there would change forever and no fairy would ever fly again  Anyway I love this movie Its basically Frozen with fairies instead of humans released a year earlier Secret Of The Wings was released in 2012 and Frozen was released in 2013 This film is one of the best ones Ive seen of all time theres no scary moments at all so little kids wont complain,6
107048,3318번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,This movie is appropiate for all ages,1
107049,3318번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,You grow out by three years old Ive seen that in younger kids,1
107050,3318번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,It is a very good movie about sisters  Any kid can watch it  No scary parts AT ALL and I am very sensitive It got kind of boring after watching it seven times though  I am more into watching Planes and PlanesFire and Rescue,5
107051,3318번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,This installment in the benign Tinker Bell movie series shows off some serious Disneystar talent as the McClain sisters sing a new song  The reason for the 6 and up rating is only because the storyline is much more indepth than the others so a better attention span is needed to fully grasp this movie,2
107052,3318번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,This movie is better for younger kids   It wasnt very interesting for a 10 year old  The Winterland is very pretty  It teaches one not to give up and to have persistence  It also show that somebody can make a mistake and fix it,5
107053,3318번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,Hi I am M9PIXARs friend,1
107054,3318번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,I am 7 years old and when I saw this movie I really liked it because it shows that family should be together and that sometimes you half to follow your dreams,1
107763,3354번,Toy Story 3,6,The funniest jokes out of all three Toy Story movies Greatest quality animation out of all threebest scripts out of all threeect PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT,4
107764,3354번,Toy Story 3,6,Even though this is my least favorite in the Toy Story franchise this one is still 5star worthy  It is hilarious  The reason I rated this on for 2 or older is because anyone of any age should watch this  If your child cant handle the scary scenes just cover their eyes so they can enjoy the rest of the movie  Overall great movie,5
107765,3354번,Toy Story 3,6,This was an absolutely amazing movie with lots of connections to the real world and very inspiring  However its also pretty scary and sad and some younger viewers might find it hard to understand hidden meanings beneath the character developments  All in all great movie but not for everyone,3
107766,3354번,Toy Story 3,6,Some moments of gambling one very scary scene where a baby twists its head around graphically The most scariest toy story yet Should be a PG,3
107767,3354번,Toy Story 3,6,Third Toy Story is the best but the most intense,1
107768,3354번,Toy Story 3,6,For ages 5 and up,1
107769,3354번,Toy Story 3,6,It touched my heart  Best toy story movie ever made I feel any age is the right age for this  There is comedy thats age appropriate and even my dad loved the film  I even have the it on DVD  The only thing you may consider inappropriate is romance between Buzz light year and Jessie and ken in one scene is in nothing but his underwear,6
107770,3354번,Toy Story 3,6,This movie rocks There are a lot of funny moments and colorful animation If you want to see some of the best stuff in movie history than this is the movie for you,3
107771,3354번,Toy Story 3,6,This is a really good movie  It is also a good family movie  I love toy story  Ther isnt anything bad in it that kids shouldnt see,4
108037,3355번,Toy Story 4,8,Its about demons taking over toys  Its anti jesus,2
108038,3355번,Toy Story 4,8,its a good movie but   THEY BETTER MAKE TOY STORY 5 WHERE WOODY AND BO PEEP GO LIVE WITH BONNIE AND DUKE CA BOOM GETS TO BE WITH HIS OWNER AND DUCKY AND BUNNY GET TO CONKER THE WORLD,2
108039,3355번,Toy Story 4,8,this is a good movie though the only bad thing about is that creepy ventriloqist dummy he creeps me out,1
108040,3355번,Toy Story 4,8,Some people are saying that the dummies are creepy but I love old time creepy stuff please dont judge me  The movie is good but might scare some people  Read the other reviews,3
108041,3355번,Toy Story 4,8,Its okay but I like how number 3 ends  It also is scary  Who would put slappy in a small kids movie,4
108042,3355번,Toy Story 4,8,The movie ended with the toys separating which is unacceptable   I have watched all the movies as a kid to now and that just should not have happened  Im an beyond irrated that this decision was made  If there is ever a toy story 5 it better be all the toys meeting up AND STAYING TOGETHER  Thank you,5
108043,3355번,Toy Story 4,8,The movie is heartwarming and I love it  Forky is consistent saying he is trash and wants to go to a garbage dump which could be portrayed as suicidal  Forky ends up staying and is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO funny Bo Peep is strong and the movie is funny Gabby Gabby ends up being really really sweet the dummies arent THAT scary  I apoligize for the review I first wrote This movie is INCREDIBLE,4
108044,3355번,Toy Story 4,8,Oh my mercy,1
108045,3355번,Toy Story 4,8,,1
108367,3372번,TrollsTopia,8,This series ended on August 11 of this year and its great Ive been liking the Trolls franchise since I was 9 years old This series takes place after Trolls World Tour with multiple new trolls from every tribe to be honest TrollsTopia was kinda a terrible idea because the pop trolls own their own land the other trolls should move back to their old homes the other trolls dont have the color schemes to be in Troll Village Except Cooper who is a funk troll At first I hated this series but now I love it I really like Poppy and Branch but my favorite characters from the new series are Holly Darlin and Minuet because they are so stubborn at times but funny Fans of the Trolls franchise will love this show,4
108368,3372번,TrollsTopia,8,The animation style is slightly different from The Beat Goes On not in a bad way   Its an adorable show  with a great story line considering the fact that we never got to see Trolstopia entirely in Trolls World Tour   Sure some of the jokes are childish but thats ok  If you are apart of the Trolls fandom you will love it   It does include Broppy  Moments Branch x Poppy    I love how its all about adjusting to their new way of life   It has a great message behind it   I recommend,8
108369,3372번,TrollsTopia,8,This shouldnt be Grated  Should be TVY  The series is childish like the movie  Also singing,4
108442,3373번,Trolls,8,This movie was fine a little bit of pretty OK humor but what really gets me is the MARKETING Its gone a little a LOT overboard,2
108443,3373번,Trolls,8,Too much sugarcoated scenes but violence lined within the scenes  Good for little kids But boring for older ones,2
108444,3373번,Trolls,8,Personally I think that this movie was a hit  Point dreamworks The main character Poppy is a strong passionate motivated character Now Ive read a lot of other comments about how Bridget and King Gristle make quote on quote Sexual Comments towards each other  But the thing is that dreamworks knew that  there would be multiple parents that would be dragged into the theaters as the price of their young childs happiness So of course they are going to add something  like that into the movie I mean yes there are jokes like that in this movie but they are so stupid that they just fly over little kids head And as for the poses Bridget makes being sexual  I just want to make the point clear that they were trying to make the characters do funny things because its not like youre 5 year old is going to walk up to you the day after and ask Mommy why was that character making sexual poses towards the other,5
108445,3373번,Trolls,8,I think this movie is one of the most kid friendly things Ive ever seen and I mean this in a bad way because some things kind of have to be inappropriate but not to much in order to make kids laugh  And these songs just keep going and I hate them so much  The end of the movie is just so stupid  All the trolls do at the end is make the Bergens happy instead of putting them under arrest for almost eating all of the annoying trolls  I know that a lot of people like this movie but I hate it and I do not recommend it,5
108446,3373번,Trolls,8,I think that some parents should explain to their child what is real and what is not real before going to see a kids movie So i really think that the parents should stop complaining about their child being so scared,1
108447,3373번,Trolls,8,I was surprised to see that someone had rated it 18  I mean the trolls world is colorful and the scenes are very creative  I think it would appeal to a little kid  Yes the bergen  eating trolls stuff can be a bit scary to a younger kid but its not really that scary  My friends little sister watched it and loved it  I wouldnt show it too the sensitive child though  There are fun lighthearted songs and catchy tunes  It also gives great messages  Like why you should stay on the bright side  And that you shouldnt pretend to be someone else Just to get somebodys attention like Bridget did   The only thing I didnt really like about this movie was how rude branch was to Poppy  After she finished singing he threw her guitar into a fire  But in the very ending they become pals  Branch also said mean things to poppy but I think kids would know not too repeat what he said  Other than that the movie is a fast paced fun loving musical  thats colorful and cute,15
108448,3373번,Trolls,8,This movie has great songs funny moments that would make kid teen or adult laugh   I dont get the too much violents thing everyone is talking about but its wrong  the movie it funny and makes you want to get up and dance to the song,2
108449,3373번,Trolls,8,this is a good family movie ,1
108450,3373번,Trolls,8,TROLLS is a energetic and exuberant adventure,1
108451,3373번,Trolls,8,its bad i mean why so bland i cant believe how bland the story is so is another bad dream works movie so you know what to expect,1
108799,3388번,Turning Red,8,Not the best Pixar but as an avid pixar fan I watched it with my family and I just felt really awkward with all the talk on girls puberty and boy band crushes I thought it was too girly to enjoy I dont recommend it  The story was terrible the animation was fine but it felt like an overlong puberty video,2
108800,3388번,Turning Red,8,This movie encapsulates everything wrong with current culture  Its overly feminist a tad bit racist and relies on overused cliches to be funny   The characters are horrible the main character is a little st the entire film and is constantly whining about how perfect she is  Then as per these newer films that only kinda sorta have an antagonist weve got her borderline abusive mother  Shes a total control freak no wonder her kid is horrid  Were supposed to feel bad for the mom when her mother Mei Meis grandma shows up with the rest of the aunts and we can see the child inside of her  Please  Then weve got her father  Who does absolutely nothing zip nil goose egg  He is shoved aside by his wife in what can only be described as a onesided marriage  The funny parts fall flat the emotional parts dont exist  Its supposed to be a commentary on the life of teens growing up but I see absolutely no parrels to my own experience as a fifteenyearold  This is a complete st show of a movie that doesnt deserve any of the popularity that its recieved,13
108801,3388번,Turning Red,8,not a movie for little kids,1
108802,3388번,Turning Red,8,Ive watched this movie about 4 or 5 times I personally like it but I know its definitely not everyones cup of tea it starts to talk about periods in the start of the movie and I think its fine but if you arent ready to go into conversation about periods with your children I wouldnt recommend it  Also towards the beginning Mei develops a crush on the Daisymart clerk and draws sexy drawings of him  Once again if you dont want to explain what that means to your kiddos I dont recommend watching this with them  Overall its a pretty good movie and I liked the characters,4
108803,3388번,Turning Red,8,Turning Red is okay,1
108804,3388번,Turning Red,8,I think it would be better but I realized that there are many  seens that are for the older kids,1
108805,3388번,Turning Red,8,I found it really funny intriguing and showed lots of metaphors for what is deemed acceptable for a woman  It was emotional and high quality Amazing,3
108806,3388번,Turning Red,8,EW GR0SS W0RSE THAN CARS 2 MAMAS GIRL INTENSIFIES,3
108807,3388번,Turning Red,8,Turning red,1
109780,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,The movie added shadow magic that is so creepy  Norys best friend uses shadow magic to cheat on a  test  They unnecessarily had romance between Nory and Andres  Pepper was super mean and snooty  If you are sensitive to evil characters you might not like this movie,5
109781,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,I havent read the books but Im pretty sure that based on some of the reviews they were better  This movie seems so much like Harry Potter  The magic school and the different groups in Harry Potter they are called different Houses and in Upside Down Magic they are pretty much the same exact thing  Dont bother with this movie  I gave it two stars because I liked the singing teacher,5
109782,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,This movie was a waste of my time  Good gracious Ill never get that 5760 seconds back into my life  I was never down for watching this but ended up watching to see if it got any betterto be frank it didnt  Best part of this movie is that there are no laugh tracks if there was I may have just passed out  Tons of horrible humor and cringe  At one point she said Thats cool as heck I will never recover from that,7
109783,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,the movie is great because a girl is very confedeint  The headmaster isnt very nice tho  It was scary for a little but if it didnt have that it would be sappy,3
109784,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,I have never read the book but I realize everyone comments mentions how its nothing similar  Nory in the movie is just trying everything to fit in and the whole movie is about that making it dumb  All the the other characters seem to be just thrown in there  Norys best friend the hoy Black magic Its all just thrown in there and has no point in the movie whatsoever  And that girl that introduced that magic stuff to both best friend was stupid  Like what does she have to do with it  So please do not waste ur time watching it,10
109785,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,I think its the best,1
109786,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,This movie is a straight ripoff of avatar the last air bender or the legend of Korra this really offended as avatar is one of the best shows to ever exist Rios off the fireearthairand water thing just makes me mad,1
109787,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,The first part was great It was pretty different from the book though    But it was still fun to see all the magic and characters  The teachers are kind of mean but overall it was great Until Reina got possessed by shadow magic and became a freaky looking shadow monster I went into another room when this happened  I was in the other room plugging my ears when I heard my sister crying  All of a sudden my mom yelled Get in here and turn the TV off right now When I came in to turn the TV off I saw a huge dementor looking thing terrorizing kids on the screen  I am 10 and it scared me to tears  Not the Disney movie I want to see and not the Disney I knew,11
109788,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,The move isnt at all like the books  In the books Reina isnt a character flickers turn stuff invisible Pepper in an upsidedown fuzzie Elliot is friends with Nory and also freezes things instead of making smoke Sage students dont live at Sage they live in their own house in the town of Dunwinddle for example Nory moved to her aunts house so she could go to Sage Academy Sage isnt some closedoff school in the middle of a forest its in the town of Dunwinddle Pepper is nicer shes also shy in the books shadow magic doent exist they added a introsoundtrack to the movie and thats all the things the move changed and made worse  I wouldt bother watching the movie  Oh and in the videos on Disney Channels Youtube channel they NEVER ONCE credit  the makers of the books,4
109789,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,I love the movie  so do my friends  I recognized all the actors and the movie is a little bit scary at the end but thats 1 reason why its fun  whatch on disney now youtube tv ect,4
110414,3437번,Victorious,7,TVGRated in USA 12 in UK  For violence and rude humor at least  This is not a good show for children  It has many pretend swear words like Holy chiz and No chiz parody of sht and sometimes they say FUDGE I Started watching this when I was 11 and it was too much comic violence Cat slaps Beck in the face really hard in front of the whole class and it taught me that No sht cause it was so obvious what it all means  13,8
110415,3437번,Victorious,7,Their is no sex at all but their is a lot of kissing lots their is a bit of language,1
110416,3437번,Victorious,7,This is one of Nicks shows that I like Im not a fan of iCarly  Violence in one episode a character pretends to be a stunt double and someone asks to clean up some blood  A person threatens to cut off another persons head  Nothing toto violent  Language most of the time they say oh my god  Sex they use words like boobs  Sometimes characters kiss in the halls and theres also couples,7
110417,3437번,Victorious,7,This show is one of my favorites because not only is it funny with many main characters but it also has lots of catchy songs sung by the actors  It truly is hilarious and really entertains you,2
110418,3437번,Victorious,7,Victorious is totally not for kids I think I found out that I started watching it when my friend told me that it was alright    Later I thought it was pretty bad  The kissing definitely is not okay for kids    I would not do that when I am a teenager   Jade looks like a goth on the show and she dating Beck is something I do not want to see    They do too many things that are not good for kids    Trina has problems thinking she is better than everyone else    The clothes they wear are some of the worst I have seen in my life    The only people I think are okay are Tori and Andre     The language is inappropriate  and shouldnt be talking back to parents and teachers  I cant stand Robbie   I think Disney channel has a lot better shows,12
110419,3437번,Victorious,7,its a great show but I think its not little kids but mostly for teen and tweens just sayin  I love teennick  but  I think that victorious is not a show for 6 and 7 year olds,1
110420,3437번,Victorious,7,Victorious is mainly a spinoff of one of the best shows of all time iCarly  But thats alright  After having a side spotlight in Zoey 101 it was popular when I was like 5 so I never really watched it and the role of Shelby Marx in iCarly the year before Victorious started Justice has really come far with this show  At times her character Tori along with her sister Trina Daniella Monet are pretty exaggerated  For example in the episode Crazy Ponnie where the awesome Jennette McCurdy guest stars Trina is very sick  She sneezes constantly and remarks OMG look what came out of my nose It can be gross and weird at times  I find Tori to be a good role model for kids standing up for herself and believing in her dreams not to sound clique  Jade Elizabeth Gillies is a rude person much like Sam from guesswhatshow who is dating Beck Avan Jogia throughout much of the series  The sex symbol below my review is just indicating the times they kiss in the show  Overall I think this was a pretty cool sitcom but I wasnt crushed to see it go  If you liked this show however I suggest you check out Sam  Cat if you havent already which stars Cat Ariana Grande from this show and Sam from iCarly,13
110421,3437번,Victorious,7,This is none other than one of the greatest shows Ive ever seen  Parents and kids will love it though it is aimed for tweens and teens mostly  It circles around a group of close friends in the school called Hollywood Arts which is a middle school and high school for artistic kids with special talents singing acting puppeteering or just being really smart etc  Their main teacher who teaches acting Mr  Sikowitz pronounced psycho wits is unlike most teachers a large sense of humor a little on the odd side but is friendly and has an addiction to coconuts,4
110422,3437번,Victorious,7,OMG this is crazy this is not a bad show at all oh and btw they where not in a locked room they where in a RV they where not wearing bras they where wearing bikini tops anyone with eyes can see that but you guys wear probably where not paying attention and even if your kids thought they where wearing bras im pretty sure every girl wears a bra at some point in there life I know so crazy gasp and if you think they dress crazy never ever take your child outside,1
110423,3437번,Victorious,7,i laughed so much when i saw it the characters are very good its for kids no violence and no violence but in one episode tori hit jade but it wasnt for real so its for kids,1
110454,3437번,Victorious,8,This show is a great show  Tori is a great role model and if anyone has a problem with this show get off this site u haters if you take this show off the air then I will never watch nick again and those are NORMAL OUTFITS is u have a problem suck it up and go complain to ur kids not the producers you r ruining it for everyone else,2
110455,3437번,Victorious,8,This show sucks it does not even bother to be that enjoyable it does not even show what high school is like all it is is a school for acting and singing WHY   JUST WHY these characters are not getting an education of real subjects that is just sad,2
110456,3437번,Victorious,8,Parents They were wearing bikini tops in Survival of the Hottest and Cat is not a whore  You people are over exaggerating  Do you think Dan would ever put sexual stuff on a KIDS SHOW The show is completely clean  Tori never took her shirt off and lent Cat her bra  She squeezed the toilet water out of it and gave it back to her  Jade and Beck never said anything about having sex  Andre never said You look hot without a bra or whatever  Your kids are gonna learn about stuff like that one way or the other  Its not like they are gonna go Oh I think Im gonna be like Jade then go off and do mean things to people or go like Oh I think Im gonna go be like Beck then go rent an RV and live in it so heshe doesnt live under their parents rules  Its not Cats fault she didnt know her friends were stuck in an RV  She went to the bathroom and went to go ask what that song was  She wasnt doing stuff in her bra it was a stinking BIKINI TOP Sure they use crap chiz or fudge as a substitute for a certian bad f word but if you tell your kids not to use that language they wont  They might not even feel like it  Never once has this show been racist  Its completely fine for kids,18
110457,3437번,Victorious,8,In my view the bit s where your suppost to laugh are just annoying Its UNfunny and pointless There is a very rare case where I giggle Its a shambles and its unrealstic,1
110458,3437번,Victorious,8,Lighten up a bit guysAll of you guys who are giving this bad reviews are really WAY too overprotective about your children  The worst it actually gets is boobs Seriously  What I find funny is the minute you parents get a show which does not make us tweens feel like 6yearolds you go out and bag it out to the point of making things up about the show to make it look bad  So dont listen to those weird reviews with really bad grammar Victorious is fine for eight and up ,4
110459,3437번,Victorious,8,FUN DRAMA FASHION ART TEENS all this exist on nickeldoeon victorious,1
110460,3437번,Victorious,8,A bunch of self absorved insensitive girls walking around in short shorts and screaming at each other belongs on MTV not a kid network,1
110461,3437번,Victorious,8,I watch victoriousAnd it is very funny like some of Cats lines but can have some bad stranger danger things  In survival of the hottest Cat starts partying with some random boys when she says she is goring to the restroom  There is also Trina Toris sister that is always wearing racy clothes,3
110462,3437번,Victorious,8,so rude like them kissing this is innapropreate,1
110463,3437번,Victorious,8,it has kissin in it but I LUV THIS SHOW,1
111463,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,the movie was a  2 hour garbage about some girl trying to save heros and is a bad movieSo in the first few frames of this movie you  see a marvel ripoff where a guy gets 2 swords flying toward him like thor and heros look like iron man and  mt lady from my hero academia Theres even a character named all power who is a ripoff of all might from my hero academia   In the next frames you see a girl being bullied  by a 5 year old becuase she doesnt have powers though she wants to be a superhero  which is an obvuis ripoff to my hero academia then they go  in a ugly base which has the students of ua high school just tweeked by there gender  a girl named guppy has a power of fire and ice and obvuis ripoff of shoto todoroki  and then theres a guy with a power to  get whichever power he wants which would be a ripoff of yayororuz and bakugo from my hero academia another girl who can sing is a ripoff of two charactersuraraka and jiro  a kid who bends his neck is a ripoff of a guy named sero Another kid who is slo mo but is seen digestig an exxesive amount of food is a ripoff of a guy named rikido the start of the movie is basically avengers and a 2hour waste movie  The movie and the ending made no sense and the spaceships were balls of foams with strings on  as if not frustrating enough the ending is just a kid discovering  the aliens were nice and THE END THE WORST MOVIE IN THE PLANET netflix gave robert rodriquez 2 hours to make a movie and 100 dollars I want to point out robert rodriquez is a good filmmaker its just this movie that should be erased from existence,9
111464,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Pretty disappointing   if you havent see the for I guess you can sit down and enjoy it,1
111465,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Its okay I mean I hated it but my little sister seemed to love it I think its really predictable but my sis loves it basically Im saying if your older you wont like it as much as your children,1
111466,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,It sucked  No point   At first when I started watching with my brother it seemed like a normal movie  But then when she was taken from her school to the heroics lab    The CGI sucked  Personally I dont watch movies where kids get tortured where at the end they find out they were only being tested  DONT WASTE 2 HOURS WATCHING,7
111467,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,watch with family members this would be the best movie for movie night ,2
111468,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,I LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED IT It has many good voices and infuces,1
111469,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Cool movie with positive messages all the way through  Its actionpacked and never bores you  It has a good plot and no big disappointments  Violence is very small and wouldnt scare most kids  Though the acting was lacking at times like when the girl starts singing its almost laughable just so ridiculous  Also there is some consumerism as some characters always use iPads apple stuff,6
111470,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Dont watch horrible worse then my sisters nursery rhymes CGI horrible acting sucks and it was so boring I didnt watch the full movie I watched a YouTube review and the plot is horrible this is not some kid version of the avengers it mickey mouse and his friends as superheros and horrible powers dont watch the jokes are so cringey and cheesy,1
111471,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Fine to watch on a family night wont scare kids,1
111472,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,I really liked it  and it was amazing,1
112268,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,This movies great  I feel like this movie is more accurate with the book than the new one  Its a very cute movie with some very interesting scenes  It can be kind of scary times for younger kids but overall its a sweet family movie  Definitely consider this for Friday night,5
112269,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,This movie is better than its successor Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  It shows good messages because they sing songs about what you should and should not do  My little brother likes to watch this movie and he was not frightened by the scary images  I used to watch this movie with my cousins every time they came over for Christmas,4
112270,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,This is a great movie overall  I love the book and the movie but one thing for parents  It only contains one scary scene but other than that great movie,3
112271,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,its not bad my 4 year old sister saw this and she was calm she did not say she was scared and besides its telling us kids to be honest not lie,1
112272,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,1971 Willy Wonka was great I prefer the 1971 version over the 2005 one  Any parentkid that says 1971 WONKA HAS BAD BAD BOTE SCENE11 1 STERS EITENPLUS are just too much of a fing py  I love to reenact the boat scene sometimes,5
112273,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,I was shocked to see this movie was G  G ratings are for pure family movies  This was not pure  Kids are almost killed their is a disturbing scene where the group rides a boat down a tunnel with scary imagery flashing on the walls Willy Wonka is just creepy and more  It was also weird  I liked the Tim Burton version but this was just bad,5
112274,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,I loved this movie so much it is my childhood  This is darker though than I remember I mean the boat ride a kids film A girl almost explodes and a girl falls into a furnace  There probably is nothing your kids wont understand like I did but Willy Wonka knew what he was doing where was Agusuts Gloops seat in the boat  I think 7 and up can watch,5
112275,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,Good movie I watched this when I was seven and did not have any nightmares the night after it  However a couple of scary parts such as loud music and dark scenes but aside from that no violence and fun movie to watch as a family and do not worry it will not give your children nightmares from the scary parts,2
112276,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,Willy Wonka is a family classic its colorful creative whimsical and funny  The songs are amazing the plot is entertaining the characters are full of variety the backgrounds are a pleasure to behold it is just an incredible movie Even Charlie Bucket is a positive role model  It has good message about caring  An only bad role is Veruca Salt because she is a rich girl who wants everything and being spoiled but nothing an issue  These kids doing stuff who was going into a bad game show  Gene Wilders Willy Wonka is way better than Johnny Depps because hes more like a stranger than Genes  Well I like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as well  Yes it is based on Roald Dahls classic book  When I was a fifth grader my teacher let do Violet Beauregard assignment and amp me and my classmates can plot it  Yes she becomes blue and fat  I really wish there was a school play and I watched several videos  The only iffy things about the movie are The implications of Grampa Joe doing tobacco Wonkas dark humor especially regarding what will happen to the children after they break the rules Charlie and Grandpa Joe drinks soap And of course the deranged boat ride  We all remember that and what was going on but for those who do not well Wonka takes everyone on a boat ride a calm quiet Wonkastyle boat ride   which soon enters a dark tunnel which shows images of a worm entering a guys mouth a chicken getting its head chopped off something gross involving a bug or lizard and I dont think I wanna find out what it is and also Wonka starts singing and he sounds progressively more psychotic as the song goes on and by the end he is screaming the lyrics as most of the guests on the boat are terrified  Ok well that went insane very quickly  Though never scared me but these characters especially casts get scared  Nothing sexy stuff but when you look for inflammation like Violet then you may find it inappropriate by Deviantart users because they looked thicc and very fat  I really liked to see the candy garden and there is filled with candy  But aside from those aspects overall a wonderful family film I recommended for ages 7,20
112277,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,Its really nice but there are some scary scenes,1
113801,3591번,Zombies 2,8,This movie is the best Awesome songs and a great plot YOU REALLY SHOULD WATCH,3
113802,3591번,Zombies 2,8,This movie is a masterpiece The actors are absolutely brilliant  Meg donnelly has definitely improved her acting to be one of the best on the film too Milo manheim was as good as ever  All the actors from zombies 1 were as amazing as ever  The new actors were absolutely fantastic Chandler kinney as willa had the seriousness and sarcasm  Pearce Joza as wyatt had the seriousness and the comedy  Ariel Martin Aka Baby Ariel had the comedy and the adorableness The plot was amazing  I dont know why people are saying it was rushed and they didnt know what was going on  I understood all of it  They were probably just on their phones not paying attention  The characters even had character development from the first film The songs are much better too I have had them in my haed ever since it came out The dances are amazing too  There is one kiss ate the end between zed and addison but you cant really see it  zed kinda covered addisons face with his heads so it wasnt explicit or any thing  There was no sexualised dancing or movements like there was in descendants 3  It was still a bit cheesy but its from Disney channel what do you expect The breaking of the fourth wall was a bit weird but if you look past that it is amazing It might be a bit scary for 4 and below ages when the werewolves wolf out their eyes light up and they bare their fangs and claws but it depends on the child  There are no bad role models either so if your child looks up the actors in interviews and YouTube in general they will see amazing young people that are kind funny and good people  Overall film is epic and I definitely recommend it to you,24
113803,3591번,Zombies 2,8,I love this movie I liked this first movie a lot but I think this is even better  The songs are really catchy and I like them  There is some mildly freighting scenes but I really like the plot You will want to watch the first one first or else it wont make much sense  The effort put in to the speech songs and scenery are amazing  A mustwatch for me,7
113804,3591번,Zombies 2,8,Zombies 2 is a pretty lukewarm movie  Its not awful but the acting is just not my favorite and the plot is kind of all over the place  Also theres so many things about this movie that dont make sense like if the mayor reinstated all monster segregation laws then why were the zombies and werewolves still at school,3
113805,3591번,Zombies 2,8,It has quality acting and I loved it  It has a few songs that are really catchy and it has a clever layout and ideas  I LOVED when Addison thinks shes a werewolf but she isnt and in the end her hair glows in her sleep so it implies that she really is a werewolf and in the background its a full moon  I think that the necklace only worked in the moonlight  Very good film and even some parents will enjoy it  All kids should see it but I think mostly 9 year olds like it more,6
113806,3591번,Zombies 2,8,this is my favorite one so far i know there is only 2 i think its cool how Addison is so accepting of all creatures a definite stuck at home watch need,1
113807,3591번,Zombies 2,8,These people needs to learn the definition of zombies  They are dead eating humans that eat other humans not nice zombies  Also there isnt a bracelet to control zombies  Thats so dumb,4
113808,3591번,Zombies 2,8,Zombies 2  the film is amazing  I loved the dancing and the songs they were really good and I cant decide which song is my favourite Flesh and Bone We own the night or The call to the  wild I especially love the wolves and also Addisonwho wants to find where she  belongs its a mystery,3
113809,3591번,Zombies 2,8,I think it is a great movies for kids  Some parts may be a little scary for younger kids,2
113810,3591번,Zombies 2,8,it is better than zombies but i hate that addison just goes with the wolves when shes not one also zed steals addisons necklace bucky is offensive he treats zombies horibly and everyone is scared of werewolves,1
114099,3595번,Zootopia,7,Zootopia is a a awesome disney movie for families it has just about everything you would want in a animated movie mystery action great charecters and it has a great plot  I would really recommend watching this movie,1
114100,3595번,Zootopia,7,Wonderful film Judys personality is a WONDERFUL role model  Interesting and humorous Judys right try your best,4
114101,3595번,Zootopia,7,This moving story tells you about how we should be open to all races and I totally agree  Amazing,2
114102,3595번,Zootopia,7,A classic underdog story Judy a bunny in a world full of animals wants to become a police officer but she instead is a meter maid  After she is told to resign she instead takes on a missing persons case and after solving it she is seen as a hero  There are some sex jokes and there are even a  few references to Breaking Bad but no one under 12 would even notice them,3
114103,3595번,Zootopia,7,From the creators of Frozen and Big Hero 6 comes an allnew original story that brings us laughs love and adventure in this new original film  Judy Hopps is a young bunny with the dream of becoming a police officer despite constant reminders that a bunny cop is a crazy idea  Her wish is granted when she is dubbed the very first rabbit police officer and heads off to Zootopia a multimammal paradise where predator and prey seemingly live in peace and harmony  With the weight of a new case on her shoulders Judy must race against time to solve the mystery and prove that she is more than your average dumb bunny  However in the midst of a shifty fox named Nick her job is about to get a whole lot harder  Disney has brought us a remarkable production that defies stereotypes embraces friendship and shows us the true outcome of perseverance  And after all whats not to like The animation is beautiful the voice cast is spot on and the script is brilliant  Judy Hopps is far from your average dumb bunny  Shes clever witty determined and encouraging  Nick Wilde starts out as a shifty scam artist fox but with the help of Judy he learns the error of his ways and looks past his own stereotypes while assisting her  While this movie has numerous positive messages and role models it has a fair amount of peril and language  SPOILER ALERTS Predators go savage and chase Judy and Nick  There is a jumpscare when a tiger jumps from out of the darkness in its cage  Early in the movie 9yearold Judy is pushed and clawed across the face by a bully fox and later in the movie Nick has a flashback to when he was bullied by other animals  Theres an explosion a train crash and falling from heights  Mr  Big threatens to ice Nick and Judy or drown them in icy water but he changes his mind at the last minute  In one scene it appears that Nick has turned savage and he bites Judy  Aside from all of the violence there is frequent namecalling with insults such as jerk stupid dumb loser and at least three uses of oh my God  At one point it seems as though someone has said hell but they really didnt  The only sex is an animal naturalist club where mammals meet together without clothes its extremely awkward for Judy but audience members probably wont be rattled  Amidst all of this theres a good amount of humor in the movie  Some references such as the DMV or The Godfather probably wont be as obvious to the kids but theres still plenty of laughs in there for young viewers too  There are also great messages about teamwork friendship perseverance antibullying following your dreams and looking beyond stereotypes  All in all this is probably one of 2016s greatest films quite honestly being the 24highestgrossing film of all time and it is definitely worth seeing,25
114104,3595번,Zootopia,7,Good to watch once,1
114105,3595번,Zootopia,7,At first before I saw this I thought it would be a lame animated kiddie movie but in the end it was pretty cute  It has great messages for kids like not to give up  The trailer might turn you off from seeing the movie because it doesnt really show what the movie is about but any little kids will probably enjoy  There is one or two dark scenes where animals are locked in cages that kids who get scared easily might not like  This is a great movie to watch as a family with younger kids,5
114106,3595번,Zootopia,7,Im ticked at these parent reviews  Our 10 yearold couldnt sleep at night  What Your child was scared at a playful acting scene between two characters acting to fight I dont know what kids these days fantasize about but Jesus only knows  This movie is phenomenal best animated movie in history   It shows you that the blacks shouldnt be against whites or vice versa  Were all in this together as America  If youre gonna get aggressive to be aggressive the cops are coming  This is a great movie with all the anticop BLM bullcrap going on  Great message adorable characters,11
114107,3595번,Zootopia,7,Honestly this movie is very good  I thought it was MUCH better than The Secret Life of Pets  Well at least older kids my age might think so  Take your kids to see Secret Life of Pets because for a kid movie this movie is pretty mature  I am nine years old and thought this movie was VERY scary  The animals go savage and act like theyre drunk  Theres a scary black jaguar part when he goes crazy and a animal almost purposely drowns the main characters in cold water BUTTTTT on the good side this movie has really good messages and awesome likeable role models  So before letting your preschoolers see this movie think about my reveiw  But if your a parent of  a preschooler than I recommend you watch this,10
114195,3595번,Zootopia,8,Zootopia was a very good movie  It was funny beautiful and heartwarming  But dont be fooled Adults can enjoy this movie just as much as kids can  Theres even a notsosubtle Breaking Bad reference  This movie deals with subjects such as bullying and racism A big part of the plot revolves around making predators look bad and making people treat them differently  Some animals go savage and there is some jumpscare scenes with these savage animals  Overall this movie promotes friendship and equality,7
114196,3595번,Zootopia,8,There are some good and funny moments and some bad and scary moments  But what really freaked me out was the Savage animal part with the panther and the otter  Seriously I was really scared  I had trouble sleeping  There was no hint of the violence in the trailer  But the rest was awesome and funny,6
114197,3595번,Zootopia,8,I went to the theater with my 8yearold brother and he was really scared because of the violence  I dont think 9yearolds can handle too much violence but 10yearolds yeah  They have the ESRB rating E10 which is similar to PG with mild violence  So it is suitable for those 10 and up  There could be some good messages there,5
114198,3595번,Zootopia,8,It is an awesome movie I saw it just a couple of days ago,2
114199,3595번,Zootopia,8,Note Spoiler,1
114200,3595번,Zootopia,8,Took my 6 yr old girls to this and I really wish I would have checked this website before hand because it was too scary for my sensitive girls   They were frightened most of the movie and cried a little too   The movie is fast paced and its about 90 scary parts   There wasnt enough light hearted or sweet or funny parts to balance out the scary   Over all it was a good movie with lots of great messages especially for what is going socially right now and the spectacle that this election has turned out to be     Its just not appropriate  for anyone under 8 or 9,6
114201,3595번,Zootopia,8,Before I saw it I thought that it wouldnt be great but I was wrong  There are great role models but there are some sort of intense chase scenes and towards the end Judy gets a cut that I had to look away from  although Im a  hemophobe   Overall it has good characters good lessons and awesome music,2
114202,3595번,Zootopia,8,This movie was amazing I want to be a director when I grow up and Im also type 1 diabetic if you dont know what that is PLEASE look it up so Judy inspired me a lot I loved the messages of prejudice and anyone can be anything  However there are a couple uses of darn one use of Oh My God and a couple uses of heck me and my family werent offended but other families might be  Also there were some families with toddlers and preschoolers who came to the theater  I didnt think they shouldve came because there were a couple scenes of savage animals going crazy  cough cough not rating Frozen G cough cough I was comfortable but there was one scene where the whole theater jumped out of their seats but I noticed at least 5 little kids leaving the theater early and 1 kid who made it to the end was crying and screaming Mama Papa in the parking lot  Dont send your little kids to this movie  Any kids who are 9 and older maybe mature 8 year olds teenagers and adults should go to this movie Me and my mom are planning on going to see it again and preordering it on Apple TV,12
114203,3595번,Zootopia,8,I saw Zootopia in the movie theater and the kids there were TERRIFIED  There was a scary for them jump scare in a scary setting  Also there was a lot of adult references but they would probably go over your kids head,3
114204,3595번,Zootopia,8,I saw it at the drivein  My brother totally SCREAMED HIS HEAD OFF and we had to leave early,3
114205,3595번,Zootopia,7,This is an excellent movie for older kids  There are references to drugs and Breaking Bad a tv show for adults,2
114206,3595번,Zootopia,7,Everything was great about this,1
114207,3595번,Zootopia,7,Ok so I suppose you may think Gazelle may dress a LITTLE skimpily but cmon it wasnt really revealing and kids probably wont think much of it  As for the scene where the animals are doing yoga sure they arent wearing anything but theyre ANIMALS for goodness sake   Most kids in the theatre just found it funny  The trailers are kind of misleading I suppose but the movie isnt too violent  Younger children and sensitive older children may be frightened by scenes such as SPOILER when Judy and Nick are chased by the panther but that isnt too scary to cause nightmares  There are also great messages like you can be what you want and it also encourages your children to fight stereotypes and prejudice  It also has many funny parts and the story is quite interesting and engaging  Although there are several frightening bits it is mostly light hearted humour  Overall a great movie for teens and older children about 10 and up as they are probably this movies target audience and also for adults I guess younger children about 7 to 10 may not get some parts but they should still enjoy the movie,9
114208,3595번,Zootopia,7,That was THE BEST movie EVER,1
114209,3595번,Zootopia,7,Zootopia is one of the best disney movies yet  it has great role models and good messages  You should really watch this one its one of the best,3
114210,3595번,Zootopia,7,I came to see Zootopia with my friends thinking it was going to be a goofy little kids movie    I was wrong Zootopia was absolutely amazing and beautiful  It really seemed to capture themes of following your dreams and standing up against bullies it was a very inspiring movie  HOWEVER  I would NOT recommend taking a child under the age of 8 to this movie  The trailers are extremely misleading there are plenty of scenes I can think of that are pretty violent and scary  During a particular scene that was supposed to be funny at the beginning many small children started crying and it was not a pleasant experience for them  The movie was more or less a crimedrama full of action and some comedy for adults  But if your child is mature welcome to Zootopia,9
114211,3595번,Zootopia,7,This was a beautiful movie full of lighthearted witty humor and plenty of sweet and poignant moments  Those saying that this is too scary or violent and sexual need to to put it bluntly get a thicker skin  This was an excellent film about tolerance I could have seen it at age five but gave it a 7 rating because of a jumpscare or two  I wholeheartedly recommend this for the entire family,4
114212,3595번,Zootopia,7,Good movie  Very creative  Sometimes a little scary  A little sad sort of  Liked it very much  My parents and 7 year old sister liked it to  Funny  Heart warming  Definitely worth seeing,9
114213,3595번,Zootopia,7,I think this movie is good for ages 10 and up because it was very intense and scary but it teaches you a lesson  I was very scared when the panther attacked the bunny and the fox  My little sister was so scared that she followed my mom all around the house,3
114313,3602번,추가리뷰 (12),7,Its a swashbuckling adventure that features the irresistible warrior cat,1
114314,3602번,추가리뷰 (12),7,It is hilarious but has some rude humor that adults will get but not little kids  It has some suitable lessons like trust and the bond between friends  My family enjoys it every time but personally I think it is best if whoever is watching it is at least 7 or 8,3
114315,3602번,추가리뷰 (12),7,This show is very good but I think the death character in this movie is too scary,1
114316,3602번,추가리뷰 (12),7,I loved everything about the movie most movies have a pros and cons list but I cant think of anything negative to say about this The pacing was good the villan atchually scared me and the story was easy to understand I didnt come out of the theater with questions as usual  I am putting 5 and up because they do reference curse words by bleeping the characters and cutting to another scene,5
114317,3602번,추가리뷰 (12),7,Funny sweethearted take on classic hero,1
114318,3602번,추가리뷰 (12),7,I have seen the 2011 SpinOff and it is one of my favorite DreamWorks SpinOffs next to Penguins Of Madagascar Guys its Puss In Boots thats the way he is you watched Shrek and it was inappropriate and Puss In Boots is a part of the Shrek Franchise,1
114319,3602번,추가리뷰 (12),7,Contains cartoonish fantasy violence throughout not many sexual content apart from Puss being coo over his flirtatious sidekick little to no profanity  There is a gag about how catnip mimics marijuana and how it cures Puss glaucoma,2
114320,3602번,추가리뷰 (12),7,Wella movie about Puss in Boots  It doesnt work 100with the wrting being somewhat weak and the new characters unmemorablebut at least Antonito reprises his role and the animation is good,2
114321,3602번,추가리뷰 (12),7,This movie should always have a five star rating   Its awesome Many people may like it,3
114491,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,The movie was terrible for me  I think it is only suitable for under 5 year olds who dont understand it and over 8 year olds who are already older  I was very sad about some scenes  I will never forget the movie,4

114494,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,Ice age is one of the best animated  films that I have ever seen it has great laughs great story score and cast too highly recommend it,1

114496,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,I will says that is some but jokes but they will mostly hear those butt joke in daycare and school   The are some insane seen   It will teach your kid to trust and working together   Also have reabiltiy to trust again   It is aslo teach kids to not follow in peer preasure  It is funny    I will say it will be good starting shows for those who are learning to talk   It is always better to start earlier    I think those you rate 18 and plus are insane   The seen is a right amount of violence   I am okay to allow the acess with all kids   I seen many parents not supervising the kids and this how crazy you are so dont blame on you   It is better to keep this acess to kids and safe enviroment   I will mind keep your opion and my opion in oppositions    I think this will kids the improtant of trust  workship  teamword  and different meanings of family or herd or flock or school  fish   My 2nd grade teacher said  We are family and spread to school like a wild fire after from the ice age and we litimed to only one bully but he is not as bad as normal school bullys in other countries and states   It stay with also new added motto which is pretty similar to we are family   By the end of the day  We all are just the same  like water and rain,18
114497,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,Very good movie,1
114498,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,Ice Age is one of those newer classics   My brother and I love Sid the sloth a lot  He just cracks us up We also like when Diego says Wheres the baby There he is   It was peekaboo   I still feel bad for Manny that he lost his parents to humans but this movie is SO good  I understand why it got 82 in the reviews,7
114499,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,Parents can know that i like this film  It is amazing Especially if you are a Wooly Mammoth or a Giant Ground Sloth  I know you will like it   oh and by the way it was swell if you like california where they made the film  Bye earthlings  Im just so excited for my next review  My aliens and earthlings I bid you well  Oh and bye the way i like you  Bye,10
114500,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,As of 2020 there are five Ice Age movies and with the fifth being a failure it doesnt look like it will continue anytime soon,1
114501,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,Nobody should ever have to lay eyes on that monstrosity of a baby,1
114502,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,DO NOT let your children watch this terrible movie it truly is an abomination  The Ice Age Baby is maybe the worst thing ever and teaches a terrible messages  Parents should not even watch this they would  probably die,3
114503,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,I enjoy this film and think the cgi holds up  Has some violence but overall an enjoyable story that the family can watch  I thought it was good but surprised how big the franchise is now,3
114504,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,This movie is one of the best movie I seen on 2001 Its so unique and it really put the message out and what do you do for a family or your friends that you protect them from danger I think this is a really nice message to this and the movie is so awesome and the best I have seen when I was young,3
114505,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,Its a toddler movie theres no other way to put it  But the reason for 5 stars is because its one of them special kids movies that all ages can watch  Be curious with toddlers of 2 or under though there is some scary scenes,3
114506,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,I like this movie  It is about animals adventure,2
114507,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,Sort of cute movie but Manny is so annoying  Its a pretty cliche movie  Manny reminds me of Calliou and it sounds like his nose is clogged up the whole time    I strongly dislike this movie but the other ones are ok  Sid is just gross he makes me naseous but    MANNY RUINS IT ALL Do not watch,6
114508,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,okay this was one of the most boringest movies of all time its just so stupid dont watch this stupid movie I shut it off in the first 30 minutes  dont waste your money or time watching this,2
114509,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,Title says all,1
114555,3609번,추가리뷰 (19),7,This movie is great for kids with imagination or really anyone  It serves as a reminder that social outcast is no good and shows some kickass dragons along the way  If you havent seen it yet I dont know what your doing Give it a watch with your kid or by yourself you wont regret it,4
114556,3609번,추가리뷰 (19),7,I think that for 10 and up This shows a lot of caring and kind  It is also good for history,2
114557,3609번,추가리뷰 (19),7,Funny intense may scare younger kids great messages and role models gooood,1
114558,3609번,추가리뷰 (19),7,This movie is a work of art  Everything just fits together in the end and the characters have great development and the story is incredibly outstanding for a kids film,2
114559,3609번,추가리뷰 (19),7,How To Train Your Dragon is an animated blockbuster film in which a young boy named Hiccup who befriends a dragon named Toothless  It is a good movie for 6 and up,2
114560,3609번,추가리뷰 (19),7,It is a very interesting movie its fun and entertaining I have a lot of things in my head and heart that I cant type but I can say that I love that movie and I recommend it to a lot of people please watch the 3 movies and the 2 series,1
114561,3609번,추가리뷰 (19),7,I have been watching this movie since it came out when I was four years old  I really like that even when every viking expected the main character to kill a dragon he was brave and refused to do it  There was a cheesy crush that the main character had on a girl  The three minor things that I would warn about are 1  Teens talk about the scars they hope to get by battling dragons  2  The main characters Dad gifts him a helmet made from his Mothers old breastplate  3  There were some filler words like the common sense review said such as Thor almighty  I recommend this great movie to anybody who is thinking about watching it,10
114562,3609번,추가리뷰 (19),7,The end was scary so if you have any little kids ask them if they need to take a break   It has some sad parts but this is a kids movie so it will have a happy ending,2
115034,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,This bookbased adaption is the first epic chapter of the Harry Potter saga  Young kids will want to see this film and I say go ahead  But for some sensitive children the man with two faces you know who and Snape may scare young viewers  There is also some blood unicorn intense duels between wizards and neardeath situations involving the main characters,4
115035,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,I absolutely love the Harry Potter books and movies I readwatched them for the first time when I was 9 years old   They are indescribably ingenious I cannot think of one flaw   Everything about them is excellent  This is a mustsee,5
115036,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,Just love this movie ON for everyone Its a bit scary and violent but ON 100 ON WATCH IT,4
115037,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,This film is delightful and exciting it delivers a great message but may be too repetitive and it is a bit too far fetched the thing was he appeared to make no mistakes and he was perfect the whole way through  And this is were the film trips up  It will be plain boring if he does not do something wrong or have a weakness  But the plot gripped me in,4
115038,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,My rating PG for brief violence,1
115039,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,This is a good start to the world of sci fi movies kids will especially enjoy this teens maybe  There is nothing at all inappropriate about this movie it could actually be rated G the only part that may scare kids is the man with Voldemort on the back of his head  Overall you really just need to know your child,3
115040,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,Spoiler Alert At the part where they go to the zoo and Dudley is pressed up against the glass he pushes Harry and Harry is on the concrete floor and the glass disappears and Dudley falls in  Thats the funny part   The exciting part is when he encounters the mirror of Erised the third time because the first dark arts teacher has the head of Voldemort on the back and he has the power to throw fire from his hand when he encounters Harry  When Harry wakes up hes in the hospital wing and Dumbledore is with him,5
115041,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,If you would like wizards and witches this is the movie for you   Be warned  If youre afraid of ghosts choose a different movie cause it has ghosts in it,2
115042,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,Harry Potter takes place in Hogwarts wizarding world of London  It is about a boy named Harry Potter who goes to the wizarding world  It has some violence with wands but no guns or stuff like that  There is some swearing but the movie has some positive messages and positive role models  I recommend kids age 10 and up can watch harry potter movies with an adult,5
115043,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,This movie is when Harry first arrives at Hogwarts  It was really true to the book there were some skipped parts  I like Harry Potter because he always goes on adventures,3
115244,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),6,very very weird pretty bad graphics too  more comedy than scary  not scary at all,3
115245,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),6,This is a really great classic movie  Its not a masterpiece obviously but its really funny A few scenes needed for skipping like implied sexual content that is never shown but you definitely can tell what is going on  We skipped these scenes obviously so I recommend you do the same  The language isnt too bad  This move now days I believe would be rated PG13 but its still really funny and I think everyone should watch it because its such a  classic  One more question for you     who you gonna call,7
115246,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),6,This movie was disappointing because of the sexual content and notevencomical stupidity  PG is not a good rating for this movie,2
115247,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),6,You need to know at the 3rd scene there is a really scary ghost its about 10mins in the movie its when the ghostbusters come to check the library and near the end off the scene the ghost screams and turns in a skeleton and theres another scene when one of the ghostbusters dreams of a ghost and it is not appropriate for younger kids,1
115248,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),6,This is a really funny movie but has some questionable material,1
115249,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),6,Good for ages 11  It has some violence sex and swearing,2
115250,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),6,Ghostbusters is an awesome movie but theres plenty of swearing  I would rate this movie PG13 for the language  Also in most scenes one of the ghostbusters is smoking a cigarette  For a mature audience I definitely recommend this movie,5
115251,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),6,A LITTLE SCARY FOR KIDS ,1
115252,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),6,The ghosts look really good animated and so are the proton streams,1
115272,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,My rating pg13 for some violence implied sex some language including 2 dks and smoking,1
115273,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,This movie was just average to me  It was nothing too special just a little comedy that tries a bit too hard  But with all i can say about this movie I can definitely say that this is a classic just because of the stay puft marshmallow man  Over all just a decent movie,4
115274,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,Good movie,1
115275,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,This iconic movie may appear to be a scary horror movie however when you actually sit down to watch it you will realise that it is not at all scary other than a few brief appearances of ghosts  It is worth noting however that there are many hidden sexual innuendos in this movie but whether this movie is suitable for children depends upon whether they understand the sex jokes or not  All in all it is a great and hilarious classic,3
115276,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,Classic comedy is alright but lacks something     ,1
115277,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,I dont feel I even need to write a full review  Its a creative original fun and action packed classic  If you havent already then what are you still doing here GO see it right now,4
115278,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,I LOVE Ghostbusters 1 and 2,1
115279,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,This is my favorite movie but there are a few negative elements I suggest vidangeling out ghost oral sex launguege  This has great messages including teamwork and friendship,2
115280,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,This film is from the 80s and like most films from that timeline it has language the s word is said at least 5 times in the film one of the characters has a dream where he gets Oral pleasure from a ghost  And Peter is a borderline sexual predator  overall great film but not for small kids,3
115281,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,I liked the movie but it can be scary for younger kids It also includeslanguageLots of smokingand in some scenes lots of sex Crude humor is in Ghostbusters too,1
115430,3614번,추가리뷰 (23),7,This movie is very funny and has messages about how you should always have a smile on your face and care about others,1
115431,3614번,추가리뷰 (23),7,This movie is downright funny there is plenty of laughs and it never gets old This movie is one of the best Christmas ever made  not only does it keep in rage with its rating PG it is actaully a bit purecleaner than most Christmas movies well the Polar Express is cleanerpurer than this movie  I think this movie is for everyone to see  Although there is one suggestive moment with showering it is not too explicitgrpahic for young kids not to see  There is one upsetting scene where Buddys dad yells at him to get out of his life  But overall this movie delivers the fun and magic of Christmas and the true spirit of it Infrequent mild language crap piss etc  is heard but dont be too worried about that,8
115432,3614번,추가리뷰 (23),7,Ferrells gross heartwarming fish out of water holiday story is clever has messages about differences family and belief and has spectacular goofy acting,1
115433,3614번,추가리뷰 (23),7,This is SUCH a good film and its great for families There are some very positive messages in this film  There is some language like hell dmn son of a nutcracker up yours and shut up  And some iffy stuff like in one scene Buddy goes to a shopping mall and sees a red bra with white feathers on display and takes it and holds it up so he can see it in other scene he hears a women singing which finds out to be the girl he likes and yet shes singing in a shower naked  nudity is not shown but bare shoulders and arms are  There is also a bit of drinking  Buddy is as great role model because he is joyful and nice and has the Christmas spirit  This movie gets 5 stars and is intended for kids of the age nine and up,6
115434,3614번,추가리뷰 (23),7,Elf is amazing It teaches kids to love themselves no matter how different they may be and it teaches kids to value family over everything else The worst it gets is a scene with some alcohol in it but besides that it is cleaner than a germaphobes house,3
115435,3614번,추가리뷰 (23),7,Its a great movie perfect for Christmas time I watch it yearly and it never gets old  Not to mention it is very funny  The only reason I rated it 7 is because children under 7 might not understand certain parts of it   It also has a good message in it to always remember the meaning of Christmas and to spread Christmas cheer whenever you can  The father in this movie is a very mean person at the beginning and then changes for the good at the end  That is a good role model,7
115436,3614번,추가리뷰 (23),7,This is a funny entertaining classic with good characters and writing  id recommend it for families looking for a fun Christmas movie  My suggested age rating would would be PG parental guidance for mild violence and some rude humour,3
115437,3614번,추가리뷰 (23),7,Elf is the story of Buddy the Elf  a man who grows up making toys for Santa in the North Pole  He decides to take a trip to New York City to find his biological father and has several misadventures upon his arrival  This movie is adorable sweet and funny with a couple of iffy spots here and there   Its probably best not to show this to kids who still believe in Santa Claus  Aside from that there is a scene where Buddy innocently goes into the womens locker room so he can listen to the girl he likes singing in the shower and a couple of fight scenes  Other than that its a great movie that your kids will probably love,6
115438,3614번,추가리뷰 (23),7,I thought Elf was funny It really shows the Christmas spirit,1
115598,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Dora the explorer is basiclly about a girl and a monkey and together they go on adventures  I loved the show when i was 36  and i think prechooler would enjoy the show  She learn kids some basic spanish like hola and bien   Parents might get irritated of the opening since the lyrics is the name  dodododora yelled randomly to the music  I dont get why everyone hates when she say things like what was your favourite part and replays It was mine too or something like that but what is she supposed to say  I hate hat part or something similar Like csm said there is a bunch of dora toys clothing  games etc  The show gets too much hate its a show for kids after all,8
115599,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Although Dora is likable to some people I am well on the contrary to that  Swiper is too scary to sensitive viewers and is a bad example to kids  He teaches them how to steal stuff from other Her shirt is too small and exposes her belly button People between the ages of 2 and 5 are too young to learn Spanish  They barely know how to talk yet  The worst part is that this show may teach Mexican children and parents how to sneak into the United States illegally due to her overinspiring nature about adventure culture and her willingness to travel the world and having too much perseverance to inspire people to become fugitives  Plus it is too dangerous to go miles away from their home alone with a monkey named Boots  They could get killed by a serial killer get lost even with map and go to dangerous places they have no idea about  Overall this show is no good at all to people,10
115600,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Dora goes to completely unrealistic places and the antagonist Swiper the Fox is a complete fool,1
115601,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,this show is anoying,1
115602,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,cuz she screams and stuff  And is violent n stuff  do nit watch,3
115603,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,OkayI used to LOVE thishad a lot of DVDS but the main problem is that the plot is always the same,1
115604,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Dora has a rabid monkey she runs into the forest with it  She doesnt tell her parents when she leaves  All in all Dora is a bad example for children,3
115605,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,All they have to do to stop Swiper is say Swiper no swiping and then he says Awwwwww meaaaaaan and he goes away  Thats absolutely stupid If Swiper is the villain why does he listen to Dora and Boots,5
115606,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,It barleys teaches spanishit steaches bad stuff like talking to strangers and playing wity animals that could he dangerous or have diseaseits anoying to dont bother,1
115607,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,It is educational for little kids,1
115608,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,i cant believe that people would let their kids watch this  HER BELLY IS SHOWING PEOPLE,3
115609,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,I Hate This Show Its Retarded  Annoying   Horrible And Bad  Children Should Never Watch This Show They Should Watch Proper Kids Shows Like Bob The Builder Or Thomas The Tank Engine And Friends Or Fireman Sam Or Pingu,1
115610,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Dora the Explorer is a really amazing show  It sends great messages for kids ages 2 to 10  Its also funny and it can teach kids to talk a little Spanish and be super nice to other people  Thats why Dora the Explorer is a really amazing show for kids to watch  There is nothing negitive about the show at all,5
115611,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,I think Dora is a great remodel for children  I would totally recommend Dora,3
115612,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Not only does it teach kids Spanish the wrong way seems to suck at pronunciation but their method is to say something in Spanish without saying what it means  It turns this otherwise unremarkable Nicktoon into barely comprehensible crap that has plenty of errors and has annoying characters bad writing obnoxious songs and mediocre animation,2
115613,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Goatworlds here  Mediocre animation bad plot no action crappy adventures pathetic voiceacting and unlikable characters  Swiper the braindead fox is horrible at stealing He gives anything back when they say Swiper no swiping Just a girl and her monkey go on crappy adventures,5
115614,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Dora wants kids to yell  Its okay for her to teach Spanish but yelling louder and teaching kids to jump of something What if kids are playing Dora and they jump of a table Do you even like the Grumpy Old Troll to scare kids with his scary lines Swiper the Fox is mean He steals something in every episode Kids will learn stealing  Shes so annoying The laet time I liked watching Dora was when I was 7 Id rather rewatch Team,10
115615,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,The show is just stupid  The characters are just stupid  There is nothing promising about this TV series  It is great for 25 year olds but then it is just idiotic  The show is part of the larger Dora The Explorer Franchise and the creators are more interested in making money off kids,5
115616,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Dont watch it much but its allright,1
115637,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Ugh this show is SO IRRATATING  It gives me a headache  A really bad one  The songs are so annoying the acting is crappy and there is NOTHING good about this crapfest,4
115638,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Parents and kids from ages 07 will love Dora but trust me things will start to change once you hit ages 817  Youll just think that its a bunch o Swiper no swiping trash  Believe me I went through that phase myself  The only reason I still watch this is because I have a 1year old sister going through the short phase in life where she enjoys Nick Jr,5
115639,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Hate it u know what I dont really know where to start but you know what Ill just talk about swiper yea wat is wrong with him when for and her friends go swiper no swiping he goes OOOO MAANN like what is it with him if he is really soo bad y doesnt he just steal it I mean cmon hes one of the worst tv characters Ive ever known about except for mike the knight he is stupid also,1
115640,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,This show is so annoying and lame  I cant stand the songs  They are stupid and annoying  The characters are so crappy  There is not 1 good thing I can think about Dora the Explorer,5
115641,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Okay I can understand some of the hate but theres no need to say its not for kids  Yes Dora does ask where certain things are when they are right behind her but shes trying to let little kids guess  Once your kid is about 6 they will start to hate Dora but toddlers will love it,3
115642,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,This show so bad its almost comical  The plot is screwed up  A girl and a monkey go on crappy adventures  The animation is HORRIBLY drawn the acting is atrocious the characters are unlikeable and the theme song is just horrible  This is the 2nd worst show ever with the worst being Incredible Crew  Please Nick Jr cancel this garbage and dont give it any reruns  Oh and parents skip this crap and try 64 Zoo Lane,7
115643,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,I bleeping hate this show  It sucks  Too much breaking the fourth wall and the songs are so stupid you might think that your brain melted  Yes its that crappy,4
115644,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY I LOVED THIS SHOW NOW WE HAVE THIS STUPIDITY TO DEAL WITH DONT BOTHER ITS BAD ITS SO BAD IT MAKES ME WANNA PUKE BECAUSE IT HAS GONE DOWNHILL DO NOT WATCH Dear God please cancel this show,5
115645,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,How can anyone like this show It is really annoying and it breaks the fourth wall too much  It gives me headaches it burns my eyes and that is my BIGGEST objection to this show  It was good when they broke the fourth wall on Blues Clues but this No way  I can go on and on but my review is just going to be 4 rants on Dora the Explorer  Is Nick Jr REALLY desperate for ratings So desperate they must put on crappy shows jamming in little kids heads Obviously so  Lastly has anyone noticed that Dora and boots walk on a road with NO SIDEWALKS They can get injured  Nick Jr needs to come up with little kid shows that has the abilty to entertain not just little kids but also older kids and adults  But instead they are making crappy shows that give you headaches  I hope this show gets cancelled  RANT 2 When I was watching this crap while babysitting it was so bad I actually felt pain in my chest  Yes it was that bad  Honestly what was Nick Jr thinking I have so many questions for the creator but I cant think of them all  Whats the deal with the theme song It is so annoying  Lastly does anyone else hate that they break the fourth wall too much In Blues Clues they made breaking the fourth wall fun  Blues Clues was my childhood and its a shame Nick Jr took it off the air  Sadly they let Dora stay on the air  No fair  Dora should be cancelled and Blues Clues should return  Blues Clues rules  Dora is moronic and dimented  Dora the Explorer is crap  Blues Clues is much better  OK rant 2 was a little too long  But still Dora sucks really badly  I love to bash shows I hate with a passion and I also love saluting shows I love  Dora is a show I really hate  RANT 3 This show is so bad it hurts  Im not joking I cant believe how bad it is  Who came up with this idiotfest I have LOTS of questions for the creators of this crap but I cant think of them all  If anyone else agrees with me ask the creators of this show some of the questions I have for them  This is the worst little kids show of alltime but its also one of my most hated shows in general  Finally I cant help but notice that they break the fourth wall on this crap  That is the biggest objection I have to Dora the Explorer  It was good when they broke the fourth wall on Blues Clues but this show FAILS at breaking the fourth wall  RANT 4 Is there some kind of inside joke in this show that im not getting This show is super painful to watch  Who came up with this junk I have so many other questions that I want to ask the creator of this show but I cant think of the all  If anyone agrees with me im honored  Lastly has anyone noticed that this show FAILS at breaking the fourth wall Blues clues did a great job at breaking the fourth wall  Dora however is the COMPLETE OPPISITE  Dora and Boots are annoying people  They are such sy characters sorry for the foul laungage  Blues Clues was my childhood and its a shame Nick Jr took it off the air  To make matters worse they put on Dora  Which is moronic crap  Have I bashed this show enough I think so,58
115646,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Well hmm          Dora is okay     but I wouldnt recommend it for kids over 6 But I love Boots I like the culture and Spanish words that they teach  So I think its better than ALOT of shows,3
115976,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,Went to the movies theater when it came out AMAZING MOVIE was my favorite movies till spiderman into the spider verse came outcheck out my review on that Mild violence one middle finger not recommended for small children great movie though,1
115977,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,This is possibly the best Marvel movie so far  The action is awesome the story is great and the characters are interesting and diverse  Some of the violence may be too much for younger kids  There are a lot of shootings and deaths  Michael B  Jordans character is cruel and disturbing at times  12 and up,6
115978,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,i realy like this movie you should let your kids watch this movie,1
115979,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,This was not my favorite but its ok  There is some swearing but not much  It has a great storyboard and I think it is fine for a mature eight year old,3
115980,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,THIS IS INCREDIBLE This movie is my perfect marvel movie  I love everything I love how this movie has so much emotion and is so powerful it will really tugs at the heartstrings  It has a perfect balance of action emotion plot everything in between  Most marvel movies have men characters but this movie has awesome women warrior characters my favorites are Shuri Okoye Nakia and let me just say Everyone  This is my all time favorite Marvel Movie Watch it,8
115981,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,Message a teamwork and loyalty  The first black hero and a message on never giving up Fightingexplosions and even A death happen in the movie Stand Hell are said infrequently  No Real sex in this movie  Its Part of the marvel cinematic universe Some Drinking in one scene,3
115982,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,Great film  Favorite Marvel film so far,2
115983,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,This movie is one of the best I have ever watched in my life but it did use consumerism violence and swearing  Though it had these it conveyed great messages and inspired us to support everyone no matter their background  It did not use sex or drugdrinkingsmoking but I would still recommend watching it with a parent or a group of friends  But if you are  8 and understand certain words are bad then I think you could still watch it,4
115984,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,This is a really good movies for families There are a couple violent scenes and SPOILER the guy who tries to take over Wakanda is a little creepy with the knifescarthing on his upper body      but a good movie for celebrating black families Another thing a VERY good movie to watch right now especially with COVID and the BLACK LIVES MATTER thing  Great family movie definitly would watch again and probaly will,4
115995,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),6,TOO MUCH VIOLENCE  FOR KIDS,2
115996,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),6,this is a good movie I recommend this,1
115997,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),6,I thought that this movie was good but kids under 13 might have a hard time following it understanding it  Also the violence was really intense  But I thought that it had good messages and role models,3
115998,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),6,It has swearing and Blood and the religion might be confusing for Kids,1
115999,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),6,i think this movie is great its just kinda violent thats all,1
116000,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),6,This movie will be good to take an 10 year old out to see a movie but mild language is my concern,1
116001,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),6,This movie gives info about the strength of black people everybody knows that black panther represents the strength of black people and it just says damn hell sht and other BUT its great  At the end of the movie tchalla and nakia kiss  but its not to sexual  and the movie puts out great messages,4
116002,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),6,well there is quite a lot of violence characters get stabbed multiple times murder as punishment etc remind your kid or teen that this is just acting and special effects  Also there is some positivity in it  It has a message that no matter what race you are you can still do many great things  but one part I didnt like was that two characters kiss at the end  blah   There is a minimal amount of swearing  I grew up around swear words and such so if you dont want your kidteen hearing that I recommend not watching this with youre kidteen  I hope this review helped you in some way,7
116031,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,Ive seen marvel movies better than thissuch as Thor  Although it is good it has some violent scene  Rude moments suggestive and blood is seen  I think this is better than Doctor Strange but this is still a boring MARVEL movie  Kids should not see this movie by it self,5
116032,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,This movie is awesome action packed and gets you on the edge of your seat  Quite violent though,2
116033,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,Black Panther is a beautiful movie with an excellent storyline and positive role models  It really values the importance of culture and diversity and supports equality for all females and males,2
116034,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,it is very good and full of action,1
116035,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,This is a great movie There is a lot of violence  But there is no blood  There is lots of positive messages too   I think this is appropriate for tweens,5
116036,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,Amazing film with fun drama and superhero action,1
116037,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,Fine movie  Watched like a million times  Knowing marvel movies this ones on the more graphic violent side but its not the worst  There are several scenes of bloody punching and stabbing and one seen of aman laying on the ground and is shot  Nothing sexual,5
116038,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,It was a great movie that includes action adventure and story  A good movie about culture May be intense for younger children,2
116383,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,More special effects thann anything else  Lots of violence as well as almost constant swearing including some brief sexual references  and more,2
116384,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,This action epic tale of survival is a must see by James Cameron  Though the story is sometimes rough the heart in it is that a disabled man has the commitment to not follow his orders and protect a planet called Pandora  But parents beware there are some extremely frightening and violent scenes that some children cannot watch because of the intensity of them  There is one brief mating scene kissing plus flirting and the Navi are barely dressed  There is lots of strong language st holy st bullst and milder words but there are no Fbombs  Although this film has some content that is not for kids Avatar is fine for mature 12yearolds and up,6
116385,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,This movie isnt as good as everybody says it is,1
116386,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,Avatar is an great movie for kids 11  The language I can handle but the naked people was RIDICULOUS Like whywearanyclothes naked OO The messages the movie is sending are good though  The People blue people are working together and are always watching out for each other  Another thing I liked was that The People were trying the preserve their earth and the other people were destroying it  Again I would say only 11 year olds  should watch this movie  Thanks for reading ,7
116387,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,This is a good movie  However you may want to watch this with your family,2
116388,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,Avatar is a very good movie for tweens teens and adults in my opinion  When I saw this movie I absolutely loved it Even though Im just a kid I have to say that this movie was very inspiring  It shows a great planet with magnificent scenery and landscapes   however it can be depressing to some because of all that  As our planet is being destroyed we see a beautiful planet onscreen  I can understand how that could be disturbing to some people,6
116389,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,Its thrilling lovely sad and explosive in all the right ways  Once again Director James Cameron has delivered an extraordinary film  There is at least one man in Hollywood who knows how to spend 250 million wisely to create an excellent actionpacked visual spectacle,3
116390,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,cbhfh,1
116391,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,Avatar was overall a pretty good movie  There is quite a lot of violence like people killing each other with guns machine guns and bow and arrows  There is also heavy dutie explosions that may be to intence for younger viewers  There is only one scene featuring sensuality  There is quite a bit of language that is not always necessary  There is not very much drinking drugs or smoking except one of the lead characters smokes a couple of times  Otherwise I really enjoyed Avatar,7
116392,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,Oh My God there is a lot of language  I mean whenever someone said a bad word  I just froze  And I am not begiining to trust Comen Sence Media  Because in the end war a girl said  Not the only one with a gun u Bich,6
116788,3621번,추가리뷰 (3),8,I love this movie It is a great one of the first MCU movies you should show your kids,1
116789,3621번,추가리뷰 (3),8,Why is this only 12 plus I think that the main form of violence was just in a bit of martial arts and Thors hammer creating storms  There was a point where a robot shot heat at them and flipped over a bunch of cars  There was no swearing that I can recall there was one kiss that was about it  Great special effects a few comedy moments and an amazing plot  I loved this movie and I think you will to,6
116790,3621번,추가리뷰 (3),8,It is funny and has some fighting but it is still not scary,1
116791,3621번,추가리뷰 (3),8,Thor is an interesting idea  To spin Norse mythology into a superhero film is a challenging risk but it paid off  The change of an impulsive and ignorant son to a loving and strong leader is astonishing  Nothing really bad but some action violence non gory and one character gets drunk  Who doesnt love Loki Seriously  Go watch Thor and the rest of the MCU,7
116792,3621번,추가리뷰 (3),8,has actionviolence throughout,1
116793,3621번,추가리뷰 (3),8,Thor is kinda thicc but could be thiccer  Thor and Spooderman have a cool battle and almost kill each other  Sexy squidward tries to kiss Thor but does not get to  This is a ok movie that could be a little thiccer,4
116794,3621번,추가리뷰 (3),8,marvel has made another great  action pact movie but its about gods  All in all this is a great action movie with very little fighting and some kissing  For violence  there are fight scenes  Frost giants throw ice spikes and attempt to stab people with ice  when touched by a ice giant some of there skin turn purple  Someone does get stabbed  The frost giant leader almost kills oden  but loki blasts him away with a beam  Loki attempts to kill thor with a metal suit that shoots energy beams there are exploding cars but no gets killed  At one point there is blood on thors face  In the beginning thor gets tazed by a girl  thor beats of a bunch of S H I E L D agents there is no blood  There is one big kiss at the end and thor is shown shirtless not sexually  All in all this is a great movie that your 11 year old needs to see at some point in hisher life,13
116795,3621번,추가리뷰 (3),8,ok movie but good for younger kids who cant watch other marvel movies yet,1
116796,3621번,추가리뷰 (3),8,Great movie but extremely violent and kind of scary  I saw it because I always watch things above my age,2
117751,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,,2
117752,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,I was OBSESSED with this movie It has quite a bit of violence but its not horrible  There is not that much swearing  The reason why I give 10 and up is because theres nothing horrible in this movie  If you like the series divergent you would like this movie A LOT,5
117753,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,The movie tells the story of Katniss Everdeen in a competition with 24 other contestants and only 1 can live  There is not much blood but some scenes are very violent and somewhat suspenseful  Katniss is a strong role model too,3
117754,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,Parents Katniss is one of the best role models I have ever seen   The movie is pretty violent though it is not afraid to show some blood  Critical This film is a thought provoking adventure about a future world which celebrates a battle to the death disguised as a reality show known only as the Hunger Games  The second hour is very intense THIS PART WAS RETARDED My only complaint is that it is too long before the titular conflict starts  Overall 4 65,5
117755,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,This is REALLY violent You better read the book or see the 2nd movie You see a LOT of blood and its more for like a 11 year old or a MATURE 10 YEAR OLD if you really LOVE your  9 year old  up kids dont watch this Its VERY scary but the Second movie is good 10 up can see catching fire D D,7
117756,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,I liked it when I watched it then I went to go see catching fire and now I hate this film along with Catching fire  The dumbest movies I have ever witnessed  Too violent sad and WAY too intense  But is there anything good about this movie Well I like the soundtrack and I can tell that it was very well edited and they did a great job on it  I just dont like it,6
117757,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,Its a great book full of emotions and struggles  I wouldnt recommend this for younger kids since its got mature themes,2
117758,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,There is a lot of violence  This is something to look into because the movie is really all about an event that is all out violence  There is some swearing and not too much but a bit of sexual content  There is also drinking  So before letting a 10yearold see this movie see what they can and cant handle,5
117759,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,The movie was as good as the book and almost have the same scenes as the book  You should really watch the movie first then read the book because when i try reading the book at age 10 it was kind of hard to understand so i decided to wait for the movie to come out and see what happens  I understand way better after seeing the movie so i read the book and now i understand everything But readers i dont recommend this movie to anyone under 15 because of the violence and the gore,4
117760,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,The movie is fine except at the beginning its really boring  There is some violence I dont really remember most of it but it wasnt too bad  Oh ya at one part the creepy dogs were scary  I think most kids would be ok with it if they can skip the kissing There is some kissing  I didnt have nightmares or anything from the movie  Its no worse than Iron Man and those movies  Almost the same for violence and action  I guess you just have to know if your kid would be ok with it  My mom and dad knew I would be ok,10
118697,3640번,포켓몬~ (11),8,At level one the game is fairly boring but that makes getting a buddy at level five feel great  There arent many Pokmon to catch if you just sit there which is frustrating at times but also promotes being active which some parents might appreciate  The game really starts to pick up around levels 1520 and it takes a week or two to get there but Id say its worth it for better CP Pokmon and a real chance at winning battles  Its actually really fun if youre willing to walk around and get the hang of the controls  The IV system is a bit frustrating and beginners dont know how to use it resulting in the discard of potentially great Pokmon  My main issue with this game is the intense consumerism  The game clearly cares a LOT about money as opposed to customer experience which is sad but the customer experience is honestly fine anyways  I said a lot of negative things about the game in this review but the truth is its quite fun,8
118698,3640번,포켓몬~ (11),8,Hi my name is blue Ive been playing Pokmon go for 6 years Its super fun  Every month they have something called a community day which you can catch exclusive shiny Pokmon which encourages you to go outside and have fun  I rate this game for 4 because it could be confusing for under 4 and under 4 doesnt really know how to walk on a road nor use a phone so it would be useless to let them play   There is some stufff that cost money and sometimes some events are rigged to get you to pay for stuff like incense but you can still play  FREE 2 PLAY and get far in the game  All in all I love this game and I ALWAYS will,7
118699,3640번,포켓몬~ (11),8,Exciting active game marred by privacy and safety issues,1
118700,3640번,포켓몬~ (11),8,Pokmon GO is better to play with friends than alone  its great to trade with other trainers so you or the other trainer can get the Pokmon you want,1
118701,3640번,포켓몬~ (11),8,This game is completely good for kids,1
118702,3640번,포켓몬~ (11),8,Pokemon GO is a good game  I love playing and I am a Level 14 Trainer as a part of Team Valor  WARNING CENSORED FOR DIFFICULTY,3
118703,3640번,포켓몬~ (11),8,Loppunnythicc,1
118704,3640번,포켓몬~ (11),8,It is absolutely amazing This is just so cool  If you want a game thats just full of cool Pokmon and encourages you to get a lot of exercise a day then play this Like one time I was looking for a specific Pokmon and I walked about seven miles that day I got so much exercise Its amazing how they designed it where you have to walk to make Pokmon appear  And there are so many addones like raids where it encourages people to get together with each other and tap their phone screen to use their personal Pokmon to defeat a very strong Pokmon  Once the raid is over you will have a chance to catch the Pokmon you battled and it can be shiny Shiny means that it is a different colour to what it would normally look like and shinies are very rare  But some raids like mega raids have a Pokmon that is in its mega form  When you do raid battles like say against a Pokmon called Mega Banette instead of catching it in its mega form you catch it as a normal Baynette and it gives you enough mega energy to mega evolve that Pokmon so you have to collect lots of mega energy if you want to evolve your Pokmon You can get shinies in the wild and there are Pokestops  They are blue spinnable disks that you swipe on your screen to make them spin  Once you do that it will give you helpful items like Pokeballs,14
118782,3642번,포켓몬~ (3),7,Look at POGGGGIEBOYSSSs review in this page XD,2
118783,3642번,포켓몬~ (3),7,its family friendly and good and cooool Im now,1
118812,3648번,포켓몬~ (9),7,Sure the movie has Pikachu saying half of the S Word and Tim or Lucy saying the full S Word but other than that it is a great movie for kids 8,1
118813,3648번,포켓몬~ (9),7,I think this movie is awesome There are false suspects and it incorporates a funny Pikachu,2
118814,3648번,포켓몬~ (9),7,its a great movie to watch it may have some words lthat are inappropriate but its not too big of a deal and if we take out the inappropriate words its a perfect pg movie although i do recommend this to be a movie for kids who are 11 years or older,1
118815,3648번,포켓몬~ (9),7,this is for kids there isnt anything inappropriate there is some violence but not bloody or gory there isnt anything sexual maybe like a tiny bit but not a whole lot,1
118816,3648번,포켓몬~ (9),7,I really liked this film and other families should see it too  It might not be for young and sensitive kids but I enjoyed it  There was some dark humor but I didnt care because I kinda like dark humor    D,3
118817,3648번,포켓몬~ (9),7,This movie is so good especially since Ive been playing the original red and blue all the way up to sword and shield pokemon games  This movie I entirely recommend  It definitely could be described as a fun quirky but slightly dark movie  It might get a bit creppy when you see the ditto I hate all the people who said slimy pokemon hes my favorite And It gives a lot of character  The film was very original I love it,6
118818,3648번,포켓몬~ (9),7,Greatyt,1
119668,788번,Descendants,8,Dont get me wrong amazing movie but THE SECOND ONE IS SO MUCH BETTER,2
119669,788번,Descendants,8,not allowed for kids under 13,1
119670,788번,Descendants,8,Im totally obsessed with the concept of this movie even as a teen,1
119671,788번,Descendants,8,First off the movie is SOOO over hyped  Another thing is that the film for some reason it gives the impression that being a rebel is cool and its good for people to be scared of you  The movies couple makes and Ben are so annoying mal just stole Ben from some girl but they still end up together    the only thing I liked was the fact Evie learned that you dont need to play dumb for people to like youwhich what Disney cjvannel shows in its tv shows,3
119672,788번,Descendants,8,Enjoyable with positive messages and unique characters but parents must beware that themes such as child abuse neglect and the effects of living in a poverty stricken society are heavy throughout  At one point two of the main characters discuss whether their parents love them followed by confessions that they are scared of their parents and what they will do to them if they dont do what they say  This is something that could start a conversation with your child but as this is a main idea throughout and something that is reinforced explicitly with dialogue I would recommend assessing the maturity of your child and exercising hesitation with kids under 10 years,3
119673,788번,Descendants,8,Ok    I  love ever after high Like it was my favourite and when I realized they made descendants    SUCH A COPY Now I have to admit I was pretty excited but when I watched it it disappointed me  I mean it completely copied EAH  There is a bit of flirting and like love and stuff like that  At one part Mal does say things like If your mom really loved you shed do this and puts Jane down by saying things like Dont you want to be prettier,8
119674,788번,Descendants,8,This was a very big Disney hit  The movie is pretty good  Predictable but good  Liked the actors and actresses,4
119675,788번,Descendants,8,Amazing,1

119833,796번,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 1",8,You should for sure get this for your kids it will make them read,1
119834,796번,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 1",8,I am 14 years old and I am in high school and I still like and read these books,1
119835,796번,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 1",8,Overall this book is actually pretty good  Sex Gregs younger brother brings a magazine of a woman in a bikini for show and tell at his preschool  Violence Greg breaks Rowleys head and teens make Rowley eat spoiled cheese  Language Gregs study group writes down bad words,4
119836,796번,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 1",8,These books and movies are incredibly funny Im addicted to this series also the movies but books are better  Dont be afraid to let children 6 and up read and watch this So excited for the new book also,3
119837,796번,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 1",8,Diary Of a wimpy kid is a wonderful book  Ive read the whole series  So this review counts as the whole series  These kinds of books are very rare  Because they are not boring their kid like   And I think Ill stick to being a kid,6
119838,796번,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 1",8,In the first edition Greg explains the beginning of his middle school life and how he gets through it   A great start for the series   I started reading this book in third grade and my mom spied on me   She read the first 5 pages and said that book was being returned to the library as of immediately   But by the end of 5th grade she felt I was mature enough to understand what the book had to say and take every word of it for humor   Ill say this I think my teachers were happy to finally see me reading a book by myself   Lol,7
119839,796번,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 1",8,Diary of a wimpy kid is a funnynice book to read I recommend this book to kids because it teaches them that sometimes school could be difficult with the people in it but in general it teaches us about how school is going to be and there There is going to be ups and downs on the way and we cant  give up  The character is name Greg and has a tuff time fitting in,2
119840,796번,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 1",8,Its not just that its not as funny as the new ones theres also more language  Examples are kissing his butt and suck it up could be issues  Also I dont doubt its happened to middle school kids but bullies in a truck is WAY too horrible  If youre gonna read the book because you wanna read the books in order take my advice and get it over with,4
119858,796번,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 1",8,When I was younger I loved these books  Now that Im older and have read them again I realize how awful they are  Greg is awful to Rowley his socalled best friend  He doesnt realize how mean he is to him  Greg always avoids being nice to others and doing the right thing but the way its written it seems that its the other way around everyone is mean to Greg which is still true and he is completely innocent which is not  He shows no appreciation for anything and is a huge downer  Also girls are portrayed in a very stereotypical middle school girl way shallow easily manipulated and dumb  This book has no positive role models or messages in it  Also some of the humor is just downright disgusting like a rotten piece of cheese on the hardcourt at school that Rowley is forced to eat by a gang of teenagers  There are far worse things that I dont even want to mention  This book is okay for kids that understand that Greg is not a good role model but not many kids of the age that enjoy these books  know that,11
119859,796번,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 1",8,This is a good book with a funny plot  Some parents may not want their kids exposed to bullying and crushes but otherwise it is pretty innocent  I dont remember even one kiss or a hit  Although the main character Greg is a pretty bad role model,4
119860,796번,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 1",8,Its the best book ever,1
119861,796번,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 1",8,I have this book and Im thinking its the best in the series,2
119862,796번,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 1",8,Well next year ill be going into middle school but right now im in the fifth grade  I think if your kid is in the 5th grade and up this would be excellent because the events in this book are things that can very well happen in middle school,2
119863,796번,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 1",8,I think this book is suitable for any child aged 9 up because its very interesting and no bad stuff older people would say  I loved the book when i read it  This book is my favourite ,3
119864,796번,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 1",8,I like this book It is so funny I love it,1
119865,796번,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 1",8,I really liked the book because it was funny and kind of realistic,1
119866,796번,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 1",8,I Thought This Book Was Disgusting  I Read Half a Chapter Then Returned The Book  Seriously I Thought This Book was Going To Be Good Because My Friends Liked It  The Book Is SOOOO Expensive 12 99 For a Book I HATED  It Has Dumb Child Humor I Hate Too  Why Is Everything BOYS in this Book It Is all Gender Stereotypical  The Author Is Just In It For the Money and To Bribe Boys Into Buying This Book,7
121265,823번,Doctor Strange,8,My persomal MPAA rating,1
121266,823번,Doctor Strange,8,This movie is really good and though there is a small amount of blood it is mostly magical fighting  The main character gets in a car crash because of texting and loses use of his hands  The battle scenes are pretty intense though  I definitely recommend this movie  It is my 2nd favorite ever my first being AntMan,5
121267,823번,Doctor Strange,8,I just want to start of with the visuals  They are soooo good and you would thing it was real  For violence there are some medical operations minimal blood except in one scene  Fights with energy type weapons and weird swords  The ancient one dies from a stab and falls out of a portal onto the streets glass shattered  When the ancient one dies there are blood scrapes and scratches on her face you cand hear the monitor beep  Doctor strange is shown dying over and over again Impaled by crystal rocks smashed with giant hand energy beam all without blood though  If you see it you can see someone on the ground with a blood pool around there head they presumably live  Language such as shit damn hell ass and god oh my god or just god as a exclamation  Doctor strange and a fellow surgeon share a kiss  All in all a great addition to the MCU but not my favorite,11
121268,823번,Doctor Strange,8,If you decide violence is no object for your kids you should be 100 fine with them seeing it  No sexual content language is a little strong but notsorecurring,2
121269,823번,Doctor Strange,8,violence 710,1
121270,823번,Doctor Strange,8,I think this movie is good for ages nine and up but for kids who like action movies Id say eight and up its a really good movie I watch it again,1
121271,823번,Doctor Strange,8,I have seen other reviews that say doctor strange is bloody and gruesome but that is only when they show stuff in the hospital that strange works at  This movie is great but you shouldnt let kids under seven watch it  It a had a bit of violence but not to much  There is a car crash at about the 15 minute mark and it is quite intense  There is a time loop at the end where strange gets killed like ten times but it is not disturbing They only show how hes going to get killed but never actually show him getting killed  Theres also a lot of destruction but thats all,6
121738,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Dora the explorer is basiclly about a girl and a monkey and together they go on adventures  I loved the show when i was 36  and i think prechooler would enjoy the show  She learn kids some basic spanish like hola and bien   Parents might get irritated of the opening since the lyrics is the name  dodododora yelled randomly to the music  I dont get why everyone hates when she say things like what was your favourite part and replays It was mine too or something like that but what is she supposed to say  I hate hat part or something similar Like csm said there is a bunch of dora toys clothing  games etc  The show gets too much hate its a show for kids after all,8
121739,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Although Dora is likable to some people I am well on the contrary to that  Swiper is too scary to sensitive viewers and is a bad example to kids  He teaches them how to steal stuff from other Her shirt is too small and exposes her belly button People between the ages of 2 and 5 are too young to learn Spanish  They barely know how to talk yet  The worst part is that this show may teach Mexican children and parents how to sneak into the United States illegally due to her overinspiring nature about adventure culture and her willingness to travel the world and having too much perseverance to inspire people to become fugitives  Plus it is too dangerous to go miles away from their home alone with a monkey named Boots  They could get killed by a serial killer get lost even with map and go to dangerous places they have no idea about  Overall this show is no good at all to people,10
121740,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Dora goes to completely unrealistic places and the antagonist Swiper the Fox is a complete fool,1
121741,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,this show is anoying,1
121742,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,cuz she screams and stuff  And is violent n stuff  do nit watch,3
121743,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,OkayI used to LOVE thishad a lot of DVDS but the main problem is that the plot is always the same,1
121744,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Dora has a rabid monkey she runs into the forest with it  She doesnt tell her parents when she leaves  All in all Dora is a bad example for children,3
121745,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,All they have to do to stop Swiper is say Swiper no swiping and then he says Awwwwww meaaaaaan and he goes away  Thats absolutely stupid If Swiper is the villain why does he listen to Dora and Boots,5
121746,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,It barleys teaches spanishit steaches bad stuff like talking to strangers and playing wity animals that could he dangerous or have diseaseits anoying to dont bother,1
121747,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,It is educational for little kids,1
121748,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,i cant believe that people would let their kids watch this  HER BELLY IS SHOWING PEOPLE,3
121749,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,I Hate This Show Its Retarded  Annoying   Horrible And Bad  Children Should Never Watch This Show They Should Watch Proper Kids Shows Like Bob The Builder Or Thomas The Tank Engine And Friends Or Fireman Sam Or Pingu,1
121750,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Dora the Explorer is a really amazing show  It sends great messages for kids ages 2 to 10  Its also funny and it can teach kids to talk a little Spanish and be super nice to other people  Thats why Dora the Explorer is a really amazing show for kids to watch  There is nothing negitive about the show at all,5
121751,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,I think Dora is a great remodel for children  I would totally recommend Dora,3
121752,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Not only does it teach kids Spanish the wrong way seems to suck at pronunciation but their method is to say something in Spanish without saying what it means  It turns this otherwise unremarkable Nicktoon into barely comprehensible crap that has plenty of errors and has annoying characters bad writing obnoxious songs and mediocre animation,2
121753,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Goatworlds here  Mediocre animation bad plot no action crappy adventures pathetic voiceacting and unlikable characters  Swiper the braindead fox is horrible at stealing He gives anything back when they say Swiper no swiping Just a girl and her monkey go on crappy adventures,5
121754,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Dora wants kids to yell  Its okay for her to teach Spanish but yelling louder and teaching kids to jump of something What if kids are playing Dora and they jump of a table Do you even like the Grumpy Old Troll to scare kids with his scary lines Swiper the Fox is mean He steals something in every episode Kids will learn stealing  Shes so annoying The laet time I liked watching Dora was when I was 7 Id rather rewatch Team,10
121755,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,The show is just stupid  The characters are just stupid  There is nothing promising about this TV series  It is great for 25 year olds but then it is just idiotic  The show is part of the larger Dora The Explorer Franchise and the creators are more interested in making money off kids,5
121756,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Dont watch it much but its allright,1
121777,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Ugh this show is SO IRRATATING  It gives me a headache  A really bad one  The songs are so annoying the acting is crappy and there is NOTHING good about this crapfest,4
121778,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Parents and kids from ages 07 will love Dora but trust me things will start to change once you hit ages 817  Youll just think that its a bunch o Swiper no swiping trash  Believe me I went through that phase myself  The only reason I still watch this is because I have a 1year old sister going through the short phase in life where she enjoys Nick Jr,5
121779,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Hate it u know what I dont really know where to start but you know what Ill just talk about swiper yea wat is wrong with him when for and her friends go swiper no swiping he goes OOOO MAANN like what is it with him if he is really soo bad y doesnt he just steal it I mean cmon hes one of the worst tv characters Ive ever known about except for mike the knight he is stupid also,1
121780,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,This show is so annoying and lame  I cant stand the songs  They are stupid and annoying  The characters are so crappy  There is not 1 good thing I can think about Dora the Explorer,5
121781,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Okay I can understand some of the hate but theres no need to say its not for kids  Yes Dora does ask where certain things are when they are right behind her but shes trying to let little kids guess  Once your kid is about 6 they will start to hate Dora but toddlers will love it,3
121782,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,This show so bad its almost comical  The plot is screwed up  A girl and a monkey go on crappy adventures  The animation is HORRIBLY drawn the acting is atrocious the characters are unlikeable and the theme song is just horrible  This is the 2nd worst show ever with the worst being Incredible Crew  Please Nick Jr cancel this garbage and dont give it any reruns  Oh and parents skip this crap and try 64 Zoo Lane,7
121783,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,I bleeping hate this show  It sucks  Too much breaking the fourth wall and the songs are so stupid you might think that your brain melted  Yes its that crappy,4
121784,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY I LOVED THIS SHOW NOW WE HAVE THIS STUPIDITY TO DEAL WITH DONT BOTHER ITS BAD ITS SO BAD IT MAKES ME WANNA PUKE BECAUSE IT HAS GONE DOWNHILL DO NOT WATCH Dear God please cancel this show,5
121785,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,How can anyone like this show It is really annoying and it breaks the fourth wall too much  It gives me headaches it burns my eyes and that is my BIGGEST objection to this show  It was good when they broke the fourth wall on Blues Clues but this No way  I can go on and on but my review is just going to be 4 rants on Dora the Explorer  Is Nick Jr REALLY desperate for ratings So desperate they must put on crappy shows jamming in little kids heads Obviously so  Lastly has anyone noticed that Dora and boots walk on a road with NO SIDEWALKS They can get injured  Nick Jr needs to come up with little kid shows that has the abilty to entertain not just little kids but also older kids and adults  But instead they are making crappy shows that give you headaches  I hope this show gets cancelled  RANT 2 When I was watching this crap while babysitting it was so bad I actually felt pain in my chest  Yes it was that bad  Honestly what was Nick Jr thinking I have so many questions for the creator but I cant think of them all  Whats the deal with the theme song It is so annoying  Lastly does anyone else hate that they break the fourth wall too much In Blues Clues they made breaking the fourth wall fun  Blues Clues was my childhood and its a shame Nick Jr took it off the air  Sadly they let Dora stay on the air  No fair  Dora should be cancelled and Blues Clues should return  Blues Clues rules  Dora is moronic and dimented  Dora the Explorer is crap  Blues Clues is much better  OK rant 2 was a little too long  But still Dora sucks really badly  I love to bash shows I hate with a passion and I also love saluting shows I love  Dora is a show I really hate  RANT 3 This show is so bad it hurts  Im not joking I cant believe how bad it is  Who came up with this idiotfest I have LOTS of questions for the creators of this crap but I cant think of them all  If anyone else agrees with me ask the creators of this show some of the questions I have for them  This is the worst little kids show of alltime but its also one of my most hated shows in general  Finally I cant help but notice that they break the fourth wall on this crap  That is the biggest objection I have to Dora the Explorer  It was good when they broke the fourth wall on Blues Clues but this show FAILS at breaking the fourth wall  RANT 4 Is there some kind of inside joke in this show that im not getting This show is super painful to watch  Who came up with this junk I have so many other questions that I want to ask the creator of this show but I cant think of the all  If anyone agrees with me im honored  Lastly has anyone noticed that this show FAILS at breaking the fourth wall Blues clues did a great job at breaking the fourth wall  Dora however is the COMPLETE OPPISITE  Dora and Boots are annoying people  They are such sy characters sorry for the foul laungage  Blues Clues was my childhood and its a shame Nick Jr took it off the air  To make matters worse they put on Dora  Which is moronic crap  Have I bashed this show enough I think so,58
121786,843번,Dora the Explorer,8,Well hmm          Dora is okay     but I wouldnt recommend it for kids over 6 But I love Boots I like the culture and Spanish words that they teach  So I think its better than ALOT of shows,3

121990,854번,Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!,7,This was a fantastic  comedy  for everyone to enjoy  Then again what a creepy  movie  ,5
121991,854번,Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!,7,This CGI adventure is clean for the most part and answers questions that readers have wondered for over 50 years Did the Mayor have any sort of relationship with Jojo Do the Whos know their city is a speck in space Who were Hortons friends Did Vlad feel remorse after the Whos made themselves known It just goes on and on  They also added stuff to make it longer like Hortons journey to bring the speck to safety or the existence of Morton or the good Vlad  Really fun story really fun characters and possibly the second film in movie history to exceed the book  The first was The Incredibles  The only bad part is when a malicious Senator calls the Mayor a babbling boob ,9

121993,854번,Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!,7,I KNOW YOU GUYS THINK IS A LITTLE KIDS MOVIE BUT WHEN I SEE IT WHEN I WAS 6 I FOUND THIS FINE AND A LITTLE SCARY,1

122264,870번,Dumb and Dumber,8,If you are a teen then this is a great movie  Very funny and a must watch  Has some inappropriate scenes so 13,3
122265,870번,Dumb and Dumber,8,Even though Jim Carrey has done some pretty decent movies Ace Ventura Pet Detective Liar Liar The Mask there is nothing he does that is quite as hysterical as this one right here Dumb and Dumber,1
122266,870번,Dumb and Dumber,8,Jim Carrey was pretty good in this movie but lots of iffy stuff so be warned,1
122267,870번,Dumb and Dumber,8,The movie is good but the comedy is very immature and woman are very objectified  Sometimes the main characters stupidness is almost painful  Lyod fantasies about having sex with Mary  nothing is shown except for her top half with censored breasts and her lower butt  This is definitely for older tweens who arent very sensitive,4
122268,870번,Dumb and Dumber,8,This movie is just hysterical  I entirely recommend it Jim Carreys character is enough to make you laugh as it is but adding great script writing and just plain dumb humor it makes you burst out with laughter I enjoyed this movie a whole lot  Getting down to the age part there are a few things in this movie but its not too much in my opinion  As for language its pretty mild  The one thing I heard was ass and bitch  There are a few mild moments of sexual innuendo including Jim Carrey telling his friend to tell a girl that he has rapist wits but its used very comical   Jim Carrey also imagines what itll be like when he brings this girls briefcase back and he imagines them dating him at a diner behaving like a martial artist and attacking waiters and he rips the heart out of one guy  This whole scene is entirely comical and it doesnt feel very disturbing  After that he imagines them taking off their clothes and Jim Carrey looks down to the girls breasts and the breasts are then covered by car lights and he wakes up to see a car and that hes still driving  A girl gives Harry a carrot and two pieces of coal to put on a snow man but instead he decides to make it into a penis and testicles and puts it on the lower part of the snowman  In a bathroom scene Jim Carreys character sees a note that says Meet me at 215 in the stall so we can make manly love together and Carrey looks at his watch realizing that it is 215  The man comes in and starts forcingly trying to beat him up or forcingly make love to him but he is interrupted eventually   Some women are seen in bikinis in a car and say that theyre looking for two men to oil them up for the beach or something like that  There are a few referrences to alcohol smoking and drunk driving but its nothing too serious  In the film a man is shot and another is killed by eating hot peppers but to be honest the violence in this film is pretty mild by todays standards  But all in all great movie and I hope youll laugh your butt off watching it,18
122269,870번,Dumb and Dumber,8,Dumb and dumber is sorta funny There are references to banging and some penis jokes  Attempted rape with pubic hair visible  Harry makes a snowman a penis  A man and woman hug and you see her butt he lifts her skirt  They prepare to have sex  Tour bus scene with loads of sexual references  Brief use of shaggin wagon  Explicit boning reference  Harrys butt crack is visible in one scene  Some uses of st py and ahe  Some violence including a scene where a man rips out anothers heart  Not innapropriate  A surprisingly decent comedy,13
122270,870번,Dumb and Dumber,8,About a quarter of the way through this movie my parents realized that maybe it wasnt the best form me age 12 and my sister age 8 to watch  At one part a guy is day dreaming about this girl he likes and he pulls up her dress to see if she is wearing underwear SHE IS NOT we actually saw a close up of her butt yes it was kind of funny but I think that crossed the line  also a lot of unnecessary swears  Finally so many poop jokes  I think that a few potty jokes are funny but when it keeps going for almost two hours it becomes so crude  Do to really recommend aside to a few very funny jokes the rest wasnt too good  And it was wayyy to crude for me,9
122271,870번,Dumb and Dumber,8,So     disappointed,1
122411,873번,Dune,8,My friend told me that this movie sucked  I disagree  I really liked the cinematography and the story  The idea is pretty unique and what humor there was great  There were a lot of great actors in it also  It was kinda violent but the worst of it was a decapitation and the murderer carried the head for a bit  The most sexuality was the mention that the main characters mother was a concubine and not the wife if the father and there are a couple scenes with naked men  There is nothing exposed  Overall it was pretty good,9
122412,873번,Dune,8,This was a wonderful movie and I totally recommend it The actors were great and the scenery beautiful  The violence was not too graphic and if you are mature enough you could definitely watch it at the age of 13,3
122413,873번,Dune,8,Love timothe chalamet and he does an amazing job playing paul It stayed completly true to the book It was amazing,3
122414,873번,Dune,8,Great story effects and soundtrack,1
122415,873번,Dune,8,Dune is a rich scifi universe that I enjoy a lot   The director the same as Blade Runner 2049 makes long shots of the actors to show emotion which might make impatient viewers go insane but I personally enjoyed it,2
122416,873번,Dune,8,I thought it was a great movie  However it did feel a bit slow,2
122417,873번,Dune,8,I have never read the book I literally dont get how people can give this 5 stars and be serious about it  I watched this movie on HBO Max and I was expecting it to be entertaining  It wasnt that good at all  The fight scenes were dumb and look like a kid directed it  The story is ok  Its very confusing and incomplete  There are so many plot holes  I wanted to like it alot but I can only like bits and pieces of it,8
122418,873번,Dune,8,Compared to the awful 1954 movie this movie is a huge step up in every way This movie is definitely a mustsee if you are a scifi fan the movie has a lot of great characters and fantastic visual effects and action sequences,2
122419,873번,Dune,8,Ill keep this short,1
122420,873번,Dune,8,But there was violence but apart from that it was great and I will give it a 10 ,1
122581,882번,Easter Parade,8,Amazing Me my mom and my daddy watched it on public television  It was really funny we love making fun of old movies and there is this one moment where this women is gifted a pug puppy and she hands it to the maid and the maid makes such a disgusted face,3
122582,882번,Easter Parade,8,I watched this movie it is just incredible it doesnt involve any harmful scary violent drug drinking smoking scenes and moments some scenes may be a bit boring for younger children but it is subtitle for 6 and up,1
122998,897번,Elf,7,This movie is very funny and has messages about how you should always have a smile on your face and care about others,1
122999,897번,Elf,7,This movie is downright funny there is plenty of laughs and it never gets old This movie is one of the best Christmas ever made  not only does it keep in rage with its rating PG it is actaully a bit purecleaner than most Christmas movies well the Polar Express is cleanerpurer than this movie  I think this movie is for everyone to see  Although there is one suggestive moment with showering it is not too explicitgrpahic for young kids not to see  There is one upsetting scene where Buddys dad yells at him to get out of his life  But overall this movie delivers the fun and magic of Christmas and the true spirit of it Infrequent mild language crap piss etc  is heard but dont be too worried about that,8
123000,897번,Elf,7,Ferrells gross heartwarming fish out of water holiday story is clever has messages about differences family and belief and has spectacular goofy acting,1
123001,897번,Elf,7,This is SUCH a good film and its great for families There are some very positive messages in this film  There is some language like hell dmn son of a nutcracker up yours and shut up  And some iffy stuff like in one scene Buddy goes to a shopping mall and sees a red bra with white feathers on display and takes it and holds it up so he can see it in other scene he hears a women singing which finds out to be the girl he likes and yet shes singing in a shower naked  nudity is not shown but bare shoulders and arms are  There is also a bit of drinking  Buddy is as great role model because he is joyful and nice and has the Christmas spirit  This movie gets 5 stars and is intended for kids of the age nine and up,6
123002,897번,Elf,7,Elf is amazing It teaches kids to love themselves no matter how different they may be and it teaches kids to value family over everything else The worst it gets is a scene with some alcohol in it but besides that it is cleaner than a germaphobes house,3
123003,897번,Elf,7,Its a great movie perfect for Christmas time I watch it yearly and it never gets old  Not to mention it is very funny  The only reason I rated it 7 is because children under 7 might not understand certain parts of it   It also has a good message in it to always remember the meaning of Christmas and to spread Christmas cheer whenever you can  The father in this movie is a very mean person at the beginning and then changes for the good at the end  That is a good role model,7
123004,897번,Elf,7,This is a funny entertaining classic with good characters and writing  id recommend it for families looking for a fun Christmas movie  My suggested age rating would would be PG parental guidance for mild violence and some rude humour,3
123005,897번,Elf,7,Elf is the story of Buddy the Elf  a man who grows up making toys for Santa in the North Pole  He decides to take a trip to New York City to find his biological father and has several misadventures upon his arrival  This movie is adorable sweet and funny with a couple of iffy spots here and there   Its probably best not to show this to kids who still believe in Santa Claus  Aside from that there is a scene where Buddy innocently goes into the womens locker room so he can listen to the girl he likes singing in the shower and a couple of fight scenes  Other than that its a great movie that your kids will probably love,6
123006,897번,Elf,7,I thought Elf was funny It really shows the Christmas spirit,1
123859,929번,Epic,8,A good plot formed movie however it is not that epic in my opinion,1
123860,929번,Epic,8,Epic is a visually appealing movie but sadly has a derivative storyline  The Positives are The Voice acting Believable acting and most of all each actor fits the character that it portrays the animation Visually appealing nicely designed and fittingly gorgeous the music it fits the movie and is at times on cue with the emotions at hand the pace very fast and finally the messages I liked how it showed that Relationships are important never give up and always forgive  The Negatives are the derivative storyline Pretty much steals Narrative ideas from Avatar The Littles and Honey I Shrunk the Kids the lack of character development Pretty much no characters are developed typical bad guy Nothing about him stands out as well as his background isnt explored clichd fatherdaughter relationship and finally the movie wasnt epic The title is epic and in No way was the movie actually that and was rather small in scope  I would not recommend this film,4
123861,929번,Epic,8,It has good messages as well as not nice swear words,1
123862,929번,Epic,8,In my opinion it didnt quite reach the level of epic but it was good  The scenery was quite magnificent and creative with its majestic colours  Furthermore it was violent but nothing like gore and blood just sword fighting very awesome  Also there was funny scenes but mostly they involve with a slug a very dashing and cool one  However I was disappointed of the way they put the moral out  The character kind of went a bit of track in the solution of defeating the evil and didnt give me a powerful message but a very weak one  All in all the movie had colourful scenes and had a sense of humor but they didnt quite put the moral out very well as for the romance was a bit bad I have to mention and a boring time to time  Thats my opinion though,8
123863,929번,Epic,8,good sometimes boring  i only liked ais ansari,2
123864,929번,Epic,8,Im 10 and this movie was pretty good  it might be a little to violentscary for kids under 7  its not bloody or any thing intense its little guys and the bad guys try to destory the forest  If i could chose the MPAA rating and reason it would be this film is rated PG for Mild Action and scary events for young kids,3
123865,929번,Epic,8,Its a really good movie and it doesnt have any rude parts Some of the parts are really funny Children you celebrities well will probably know Beyonce so kids will be crazy about it but tell the kids that she is only there for beginning part because after that she dies,1
123866,929번,Epic,8,Epic is a nice movie that can create a franchise once again for Blue Sky  It is a very different story and is a fun movie for kids  BottomLine It is fun movie for kids as it has a different story,3
123867,929번,Epic,8,My sister who is 4 years old was very scared of the part of the movie that was about decay and minimen in dead rat bodies but for me it was the best movie of 2013 because I love nature and archery and it has a lot of this in the movie,1
124470,968번,Far from the Madding Crowd,8,My ratingPG13 for racy contentand gory images,1
124471,969번,Far from the Tree,7,you should watch it,1
125192,1000번,Finding Dory,8,I saw it in the theaters for my birthday present  When i saw it I LOVED IT I will tell you that this is one of the best animated drama movies of the year that it was made  For like twenty years or something of all drama films this one is awarded for  APPROPRIATENESS FOR KIDS OF ALL AGES  I mean little kids with no taste of emotion would want to see itMan Im talking like preschool  I think Dory starring in place of Nemo would be something the kids would want to see  Plus the characters during Dorys search for her parents inspire the kids  So lay down on the couch turn on the tv and watch some Finding Dory,9
125193,1000번,Finding Dory,8,This movie is very well appropriate for kids that love adventure  A good part that I saw was a funny part where the otters drove a van Mildly scary no violence at all  I recommend it,4
125194,1000번,Finding Dory,8,I thought finding dory was a good and funny movie because dory cant find her family  she stayed with marlins family until she can find her family she thought her family was dead and final her family was alive,2
125195,1000번,Finding Dory,8,Its supposed to be funny and cheery for little 5 and 6 year olds but honestly I nearly cried at some bits AND IM 11 But they did hide an obvious sexual joke at the start    5 and 6 year olds definitely would not understand  Families When your 5 or 6 year old asks about mummies and daddies and babies blame Pixar and Disney,3
125196,1000번,Finding Dory,8,I think that it is a great film with a great message about teamwork  there is no bad language and it isnt too sad,2
125197,1000번,Finding Dory,8,I find the content in the movie quite offensive  It is definitely not the Pixar I am used to,2
125198,1000번,Finding Dory,8,This movie has you laughing from the first scene to the last one  It is very humorous for kids and adults alike  My mom and I couldnt stop imitating Bailey once we walked out of the theater  The story is about young dory trying to find her parents and introduces a lot of good life skills to kids such as what to do if you encounter a whale shark  Excellent movie and family friendly,6
125199,1000번,Finding Dory,8,I watched Finding Nemo when I was about 4 years old and loved it When this came out 13 years later it was well made  It had a different plot new loving characters plus some very emotional moments  Dory is a great role model because although shes forgetful she never gives up on finding her family and always refers to her childhood to help her in sticky situations  Plus some other characters play great role models like Destiny who always warns and helps Dory and her friends  The film also has great messages involving not giving up and family and sticking together is important  Although there are a couple of scenes that may disturb young children such as when Dory gets separated or a giant squid chases Dory and her friends  Overall amazing made sequel and is a great choice for kids age 6 and up,8
125200,1000번,Finding Dory,8,On par with Finding Nemo,1
125201,1000번,Finding Dory,8,it is a very very good sequel to finding memo  you have to watch finding memo to understand the movie,1
125319,1005번,Finding Nemo,8,Finding Nemo is a really good movie  It can teach children how aquatic animals interact with each other and what they look like  There is one scary scene that involves a menacing angler fish,3
125320,1005번,Finding Nemo,8,This movie is funny not boring so it keeps moving  This movie has very little intense scenes  Bruce the antagonist the shark maybe a little scary for youngsters but I think that Dory and Nemos dad handle it very well  This is a positive well made family movie that is a classic still to this day,4
125321,1005번,Finding Nemo,8,Loved this movie and it also taught me lots about the ocean,1
125322,1005번,Finding Nemo,8,Pixar has made a lot of amazing films but this may just be just the best one yet   Nemo Dory and Marlin are some of the best movie characters for children ever   One thing for parents to understand is that there is a lot of suspense and action throughout that may upset younger viewers   6 sounds about right   By the way theres very little consumerism,5
125323,1005번,Finding Nemo,8,Finding Nemo is a pretty good movie great messages  its a little educational showing all the ocean animals but not too much   Has some scary parts like sharks wanting to eat the fish and at one point some bombs under water go off so some kids might be scared also some moments where some beards try to eat the main characters and a lot of sad moments so I didnt like the movie too much because it was kind of sad a lot but I think a lot of other people would still like it,2
125324,1005번,Finding Nemo,8,Finding Nemo is a fun family film but its important to know that this film has some very dark moments,1
125325,1005번,Finding Nemo,8,I Would Rate This 0 Stars If I Could  First Of All  When Coral And All But One Baby Get Eaten By A Shark I Thought What Why Cant Coral Just Have To Go Somewhere Else For Some Reason And Could Take All But One Baby  The Next Thing Thats Wrong With It Is The Violence  I Mean When Blood Is Shown It Leads To A NearDeath Shark Attack  Also Did They HAVE To Give Darla A Reputation For Killing Fish Beacause She Shakes The Bag Too Hard Why Cant Nemo Just Not Want To Go With Her Beacause He Was Afraid Hed Never See His Father Again Also Does Nemo Have To Be Kidnapped In The First Place Why Couldnt He Just Have Something Special Taken Away From Him The Last Thing Is Its Just Plain Old Boring The Only Reason Why Ive Seen It Twice Was To Try Out The Movie Then I Had To Watch It Again Beacause I Was At Summer Camp  Its Just Plain Old Terrible  Dont Bother,12
125543,1013번,First Day,8,This show is amazing I watched it all in a day and it was short and sweet  The representation is spectacular and shows characters have good character development  I think this show is for 10 because some concepts younger children may not understand  I definitely recommend,5
125544,1013번,First Day,8,Really touching TV series about transgender girl,1
126657,1076번,Frozen 2,8,Boring  Most of it is music and the music is not even good,2
126658,1076번,Frozen 2,8,Loved it quite emotional at some points though,1
126659,1076번,Frozen 2,8,Even though the visuals were great Olaf was at his prime and Panic at the Discos Into the Unknown is excellent the story itself falls short  Also there was too much focus on Elsa  The whole Elsa this and Elsa that was annoying  Anna shouldve been the fifth spirit,4
126660,1076번,Frozen 2,8,This is totally child friendly  There are no bad words or anything inappropriate  There is a lot of singing which kinda made it feel like there was not a main plot but I like this movie and my sisters watched this and they loved it  The characters are silly and creative  There are some intense parts but theyre not really intense but it may be to some really sensitive kids  There are two characters that are a couple which some parents may think that it is not for younger kids and it kinda just depends,6
126661,1076번,Frozen 2,8,Frozen is a good movie in my opinion  Its good at showing the relationship of two sisters its story is standard for a Disney princess movie but it is a good modern interpretation  Frozen 2 is not anywhere near the first  The less focus on characters makes the amazing cast feel seperated  Every B story has almost nothing to do with the final plot points and could be summarized in a sentence  I think some of the stuff with the forest people and Arendelle is good but its few and far between,6
126662,1076번,Frozen 2,8,So this movie has much better quality and the animations are a lot better  The songs are catchy and the plot is really awesome  My jaw dropped a lot when I saw this in theaters a year ago,3
126663,1076번,Frozen 2,8,I really liked it better than the first movieFrozen wasnt really as much of a story OK i gave it 4 stars because it was slightly scary  I have a fear of movies there are only 3 movies i like including this So NEVER take a little kid because Im 100 sure that theyll be scared unless you have a 1ina billon sibling  who is REALLYREALLY brave,2
126789,1076번,Frozen 2,6,I WOULD DEFINITELY SEE IT  ITS SO POSITIVE AND GREAT FOR EVERYONE  I COULDNT STOP LAUGHING  I ALSO SANG MY LUNGS OUT,4
126790,1076번,Frozen 2,6,i loved this movie it had an awesome plot and great music it was just as good as the first movie if not better i loved it and it was so good it really kept me in the plot the whole time,5
126791,1076번,Frozen 2,6,frozen 2 is WAY better than the first one  it answers so many questions about the old movie  and for the parents with younger kids a war is mentioned and elsa almost dies  thats all i have to say,4
126792,1076번,Frozen 2,6,Frozen 2 is a surprisingly good movie I expected it to be half par not near as good as the first one   I went into it expecting the happy sing along mild peril feature that the first one had been  I am here to tell you that this is not the same as the original,4
126793,1076번,Frozen 2,6,Has a few emotional scenes that made everyone in the theater cry      songs were good        new characters were GREAT        I liked it and definitely recommend it,2
126794,1076번,Frozen 2,6,Flawless,1
126795,1076번,Frozen 2,6,No spoilers The whole thing was seriously interesting and engaging Im 16 now and it actually gave me a similar feeling of interest excitement and nostalgia after seeing it that the first one did when I was 10  A lot of teens try to seem cool by acting like theyre too old for movies like these but to me these kinds of movies are all I could really wish for in this world nowadays  The songs are great the score the soundtrackbackground music is great  It could be a little scary at times depending on the kid but my 4 year old sister made it though and loved it despite the moments that she claims she got a little scared  Good amount of everything that makes a movie good family friendlywell made  They did a really good job of carrying the magic over and conveying it in a way that got the teens experiencing the same pleasure and excitement they felt when they saw the first film those 6 years ago  I highly recommend it and any of you too old kids go ahead and give it a chance,8
126796,1076번,Frozen 2,6,I kinda like this because     Well theres a horse,2
126945,1077번,Frozen,8,I think frozen is a nice movie for young children amazing songs a very good movie,1
126946,1077번,Frozen,8,Frozen has SPOILER ALERT tragic not graphic parent death early on  Later the sisters grow up apart and isolated from each other  Also Elsa has to hide her power going so far as to always wear gloves  This is later resolved when Elsa sings the powerful number about being ones true self  Anna meanwhile gets engaged to a man she met on the first day only to learn hes a monster figuratively and goes on to learn that love takes time and trust and honesty  This movies themes are self acceptance sisterly love understanding love takes time and we need each other  All in all its an amazing movie with important themes and wonderious music,7
126947,1077번,Frozen,8,This movie was very exiting,1
126948,1077번,Frozen,8,There is literally nothing worthwhile in this movie  I like the feminist message but its terrible  Dont bother its not worth it,3
126949,1077번,Frozen,8,No Role Models  Its All About Violence And Sex,2
126950,1077번,Frozen,8,I really liked this movievery interesting plot  Cute charactersfantastic animation   Olaf is probably my favourite character  The let it go song was great and had awesome visuals  I really liked this movie for sure,5
126951,1077번,Frozen,8,GREAT family movie Love the characters The movie starts with Elsa and Anna being great friendssisters but Elsas magic makes them drift apart,1
126952,1077번,Frozen,8,Nothing more nothing less,1
126953,1077번,Frozen,8,this movie is forking mint  NOT for children  ELsa shoots her sister almost killing her  this movie encurages kids to MURDER their siblings  Not good for your children  Good for only children to teach them the importance of being an only child,6
126954,1077번,Frozen,8,In the Film i Like olaf the snowman he sings summer melts in a fireplace But stops melting In a home with trolls olaf tells anna to run        while he distrasts them says Hi Im Olaf and I Like Warm Hugswarning these are spoilers so if you have not seen the movie yet maybe stop reading,4
127096,1077번,Frozen,8,Its okay in parts but its a bit slow to start off with  Theres just to many songs and not enough plot I ended up a bit bored  Ana the main character is a bit stupid and aggrees to marry a guy the evening the meet  Elsa is taught to do the exact opposite of what the troll guys say at the beginning and learns to fear her powere  The snowman was a bit annoying and overall I cant really see what everybodies raving on about,5
127097,1077번,Frozen,8,I watched this for the first time in august with my family online for free  While I was watching it I saw the part where Elsa sings Let it go  I thought that was the best part of the movie but everything else Nuhuh  Personally I think the 80s anime series Saint Seiya is better,5
127098,1077번,Frozen,8,Frozen is a great Disney animated movie that will be loved by all ages Both of the Royal sisters send positive messages to viewers  Queen Elsa has a powerful ice magic gift but is too scared to use it for fear of hurting the ones she cares about specifically her younger sister Princess Anna  However once her powers are revealed Elsa soon learns that its okay to be different and others will accept het for who she is  The hit song Let It Go performed by the spectacular Idina Menzel shows that no matter who you are you should never be afraid to just let it go and show off what you can do  Princess Annas strong passion for her sister urges the young girl on a dangerous mission that she might not return from  She teaches people that no matter what family is everything and if you stick together you can acomplish anything from climbing a mountain to surviving a Frozen Heart,7
127099,1077번,Frozen,8,this movie is great  it tells you about sister life,3
127100,1077번,Frozen,8,I saw this movie in a theater and I liked it but I wouldnt recommend it for all kids though but it may be ok for most,1
127101,1077번,Frozen,8,Im not trying to be a sourpuss but well I am a teen girl and unlike most teen girls I hated this movie  There are so many scary scenes think should a 36 year old be watching a character freeze to death a princess almost get stabbed have there hear frozen  Stick with the classics like Beauty and the beast one of my favorite movies  The only character I liked was Sven  And this is not the first movie to teach girls that you dont need a man beauty and the beast Mulan Brave,5
127102,1077번,Frozen,8,Yes I know a modernised take doesnt sound too great but actually I was quite surprised to find out this film was a perfect family film  It has entertaining characters a strong story and       well its just a lovely film and if I was younger I would be happy to call this my childhood film,2
127103,1077번,Frozen,8,bad movie so dont even bother it was 52 good and 48 bad  ViolenceViolence is when a girl which is cursed makes ice spikes and when a girl safe fire at wolves and an ice monster shouts at someone Language not a problem Sex not a problem,2
127104,1077번,Frozen,8,Your daughters will LOVE this movie if they love disney animation princess movies like this one  The movies animation is stunning and beautiful especially the opening sequences with the snowflakes  The animaters did a superb job with the animation in the movie  You also learn that you dont need a guy to save you in this movie  You will love the characters  Elsa is the oldest sister  She is very protective of her family and friend particularly her younger sister Anna  Elsa also melts frozen peoples hearts with love  Elsa loves her sister Anna  She wants to be the person she truly is even though she has ice powers  She wants to let it go and be the person she truly is  Elsa is voiced really well by Idina Menzel  Elsa is a great big sister in the movie and youll clearly see why  Anna is her little sister  Anna wants to find true love but later on in the movie learns what true love really is  Love is putting someone elses needs before your own  Anna is also clumsyloves chocolateand longs for adventure  Anna is a great little sister especially in one scene in the movie  Olaf is a snowman who says  Hi everyone Im Olaf and I like warm hugs   Olaf is a very likable snowman  Hes funny in the movie and a very likable character  You can clearly see why  The movie is based off of Hans Christian Andersons The snow queen  Frozen has more positive messages and isnt dark unlike the story it was based off of  You learn a lot of messages about the importance of sisterhood and family in the movie  Frozen grossed over 1 billion dollars worldwide  Good job Disney You will love the soundtrack in the movie as well as the animation Definitely deserves an A  You will not be disappointed in this film  Its also a classic for Disney princesses all over the world,30
127105,1077번,Frozen,8,The movie is amazing Everything is appropriate the songs are really catchy and it has funny characters Olaf of course,2
127142,1077번,Frozen,8,I thought frozen was a very boring and dissapointing movie  It had 2 princesess  Very girly,3
127143,1077번,Frozen,8,viewers need to know that frozen is an animated movie based on 2 sisters whos parents pass away  there is a really good story behind the movie it tells girls that you dont need a by to love you,2
127144,1077번,Frozen,8,I love the movie but common sense are such liars,1
127145,1077번,Frozen,8,I just love this movie because it teaches little children about love and care for each other and that love is something that happens in a couple days not in love at first sight,2
127146,1077번,Frozen,8,I think Frozen is a beautiful funny and adventurous movie  It contains love but the love is sisterly love between Elsa and Anna  I love it when Olaf says gasp I have my own personal flurry,4
127147,1077번,Frozen,8,it was an ok movie but everyone says its all girl power and thats the most inaccurate thing ive EVER heard first off all the girls have heads too big for their bodies and giant eyes whereas the guys look HUMAN and anna couldnt have made it into the mountains without the dudes help what was his name  and elsa was made out to be a coward  plus im the only person in the world who doesnt like let it go,5
127148,1077번,Frozen,8,It was okay but really wasnt as good as I expected when I saw the trailer  I like the whole moral about true love and I do like that the girl is saved by the girl instead of the boy,2
127149,1077번,Frozen,8,Nothing too scary just some swords and kissing 2 moments but overall you should be fine to take anyone to this movie   But if you take a little 5yearold they might just want to buy everything Frozen after the movie,2
127150,1077번,Frozen,8,it is a good family film  i recermend you to watch it,2
127151,1077번,Frozen,8,This movie is amazing although I wish they didnt make Hans the bad guy I thought Hans was going to end up with Elsa and kristoff and Anna were going to end up together but over all I think it was the best Disney movie ever,1
127201,1077번,Frozen,7,This is one of the best animated movies I have ever seen and I have seen a lot It has great morals and has very high replay video  I saw this movie twice on a computer and once in theaters  This is for all ages,4
127202,1077번,Frozen,7,The movie is so much fun The messages are great and Id recommend it for all ages The movie is so funny and the songs are very catchy  The plotline is original and even adults enjoy it  The songs are so much fun and Olaf has many funny quotes  Amazing movie,6
127203,1077번,Frozen,7,This movie is awesome  Both of the girls are really tough and the animation and songs are both awesome  I can have a song stuck in my head really easily,3
127204,1077번,Frozen,7,I really loved this movie  Unlike an original Disney princess movie its not about finding a prince  Frozen has great lessons and messages but there are also some parts that little kids might be scared of such as spoiler the snow monster Marshmallow and the fight between Hans and the guards and Marshmallow  Otherwise its a great movie,4
127205,1077번,Frozen,7,This instant classic is already a hit with Disney fans around the world  Once you see it you wont be able to get the songs out of your head  For days  Yes it is that good  With quite possibly the biggest plot twist except for that WreckItRalph shocker in Disney history this movie will send chills down your spine every time you see it  The only issue was the condensed story to fit the limited time frame  It seemed so rushed and unplanned  Overall though this movie never fails to impress both the younger and older audiences with both breathtaking animation and showstopping tunes that your daughter wont stop singing,8
127206,1077번,Frozen,7,Sweet movie  I loved it  I might be a dilettante when it comes to movie reviews but this stressed the love between sisters  So sweet,4
127207,1077번,Frozen,7,Perfect for the whole family   Disney movies who knew,2
127208,1077번,Frozen,7,Some scenes may be scary for children A main character almost dies but overall theres no gore virtually no sex related stuff just one kiss no swearing and this is actually a really good movie as a 13 year old I still enjoyed it the songs were pretty good,1
127209,1077번,Frozen,7,I love it I would give it five out of five stars  The movie is about two sisters one has ice powers and the other one is ordinary  Have you seen Tangled If so then you should definitely see frozen  I am totally sure that you will love it,5
127302,1084번,Furious 7,8,I think that this is too much for younger children under 12 I just dont think that younger children would watch this but what I think it is its really just a porn movie,1
127303,1084번,Furious 7,8,Lots of action packed scenes with explosives and car crashes   Some fight scenes with guns   Only a couple curses   The movie itself is very good   Also the soundtrack is really good to   A sad movie that you wont want to miss,6
127304,1084번,Furious 7,8,The 7th fast and furious film says farewell to Paul walker  With great action and extreme stunt  But not for kids not teens as there is swearing and intense peril,3
127305,1084번,Furious 7,8,loved every moment non stop action plenty of car chases few girls in bikinis great stunts bit of swearing,2
127306,1084번,Furious 7,8,Furious 7 was one of my  most anticipated movies EVER  And it did not disappoint  Violence language and moderate nudity with lots of sexual references  Violence some blood explosions gun fights fist fights and plain mayhem  Language Lots of s words 30 probably  15 d words 22 a words 1 f word 12 b words and some others  Sex Pretty strong nudity with rear female nudity for about 1015 minutes with gstring bikinis dancing on poles in a Dubai club scene  Lots of drinking and great models makes this movie a A excitement action flick,8

127797,1113번,Ghostbusters,6,very very weird pretty bad graphics too  more comedy than scary  not scary at all,3
127798,1113번,Ghostbusters,6,This is a really great classic movie  Its not a masterpiece obviously but its really funny A few scenes needed for skipping like implied sexual content that is never shown but you definitely can tell what is going on  We skipped these scenes obviously so I recommend you do the same  The language isnt too bad  This move now days I believe would be rated PG13 but its still really funny and I think everyone should watch it because its such a  classic  One more question for you     who you gonna call,7
127799,1113번,Ghostbusters,6,This movie was disappointing because of the sexual content and notevencomical stupidity  PG is not a good rating for this movie,2
127800,1113번,Ghostbusters,6,You need to know at the 3rd scene there is a really scary ghost its about 10mins in the movie its when the ghostbusters come to check the library and near the end off the scene the ghost screams and turns in a skeleton and theres another scene when one of the ghostbusters dreams of a ghost and it is not appropriate for younger kids,1
127801,1113번,Ghostbusters,6,This is a really funny movie but has some questionable material,1
127802,1113번,Ghostbusters,6,Good for ages 11  It has some violence sex and swearing,2
127803,1113번,Ghostbusters,6,Ghostbusters is an awesome movie but theres plenty of swearing  I would rate this movie PG13 for the language  Also in most scenes one of the ghostbusters is smoking a cigarette  For a mature audience I definitely recommend this movie,5
127804,1113번,Ghostbusters,6,A LITTLE SCARY FOR KIDS ,1
127805,1113번,Ghostbusters,6,The ghosts look really good animated and so are the proton streams,1
127825,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,My rating pg13 for some violence implied sex some language including 2 dks and smoking,1
127826,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,This movie was just average to me  It was nothing too special just a little comedy that tries a bit too hard  But with all i can say about this movie I can definitely say that this is a classic just because of the stay puft marshmallow man  Over all just a decent movie,4
127827,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,Good movie,1
127828,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,This iconic movie may appear to be a scary horror movie however when you actually sit down to watch it you will realise that it is not at all scary other than a few brief appearances of ghosts  It is worth noting however that there are many hidden sexual innuendos in this movie but whether this movie is suitable for children depends upon whether they understand the sex jokes or not  All in all it is a great and hilarious classic,3
127829,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,Classic comedy is alright but lacks something     ,1
127830,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,I dont feel I even need to write a full review  Its a creative original fun and action packed classic  If you havent already then what are you still doing here GO see it right now,4
127831,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,I LOVE Ghostbusters 1 and 2,1
127832,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,This is my favorite movie but there are a few negative elements I suggest vidangeling out ghost oral sex launguege  This has great messages including teamwork and friendship,2
127833,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,This film is from the 80s and like most films from that timeline it has language the s word is said at least 5 times in the film one of the characters has a dream where he gets Oral pleasure from a ghost  And Peter is a borderline sexual predator  overall great film but not for small kids,3
127834,1113번,Ghostbusters,8,I liked the movie but it can be scary for younger kids It also includeslanguageLots of smokingand in some scenes lots of sex Crude humor is in Ghostbusters too,1
129262,1159번,Goosebumps,7,I love this movie SLAPPPPPYYYY,2
129263,1159번,Goosebumps,7,I went to go see this in the movie theaters when I was seven years old  I thought it was creepy but the laughs are extremely frequent  Now that Im turning ten this year 2017 and Ive watched Poltergeist Coraline The Sixth Sense and The Others this movie is not scary for me,3
129264,1159번,Goosebumps,7,Some monsters may be creepy but nothing to worry about  Not much else to say,2
129265,1159번,Goosebumps,7,it is scary because it is horror,1
129266,1159번,Goosebumps,7,RL  Stine movie is based on a book of goosebumps,2
129267,1159번,Goosebumps,7,This movie was outstanding and amazing  It takes all of R  L  Stines creations and makes something great out of it  The plot and characters are awesome and incredibly likeable and its the cast was great with people such as Jack Black  The animation is amazing and great to watch  There is a bit of kissing and someone brings up drugs once but its not that bad  Its a good movie and has everything a good movie needs  I can not express how much i love this movie  Im sure theres a lot more to say but im just drawing a blank right now  Simply this movie is awesome,9
129268,1159번,Goosebumps,7,This movie is great but includes monsters coming to life  It also has a creepy ventriloquists dummy that comes to life with that horrifying smile of his  But the movie is also very funny  But there is a killer clown in some scenes named Murder  This could scare kids because of the new clown sight reportings  There are also falling in love scenes like a boy and a girl kissing each other on the lips  But other then that this movie is hilarious  ,8
129269,1159번,Goosebumps,7,A very well designed movie starring Jack Black  The only reason I didnt give this five stars is because I wish that it included more of the monsters  I could see myself screaming with happiness if they had the creeps or madam doom in the movie  Any fans of the books will like it will be very happy but anyone who likes a good scare and is NOT a fan of the books might be dissapointed  However there are three particularly scary parts very close together  First the mantis strikes the bus R  L  Stine  is in and a bomb goes off  Next Slappy finds Stine hiding in a amusement park and releases the blob which traps him  Finally the 3 kids are in a ferries wheel and Zach has just finished the story when the hinges go loose and the wheel goes rolling off into the woods  Good but dont show to the little ones,9
129270,1159번,Goosebumps,7,I love this movie,1
129271,1159번,Goosebumps,7,Really good but could be better  Pretty scary for kids under seven   They could use more monsters in it though  The monsters look  real   So good,6
129812,1173번,Gremlins,8,I found out that Santa was not real when I was 9  The gremlins die in a rather violent way but mature 9 year olds can handle this only if they know about Santa,2
129813,1173번,Gremlins,8,My family and I were looking for a good 80s movie  We went to Netflix and saw Gremlins  At first we didnt want to watch it but then when it started it got really funny  Especially Gremlins swinging on the fan,4
129814,1173번,Gremlins,8,This movie is an amazing classic  What people need to know about Gremlins is that there is some violence but most is just gremlins getting killed   There is some blood but most is gremlin blood which is green this might make it seem less violent   Most of the gremlin blood is shown in a few scenes where a mother fights off a small group of gremlins   The only human blood is mostly just scratches attained by character who survive the movie   There is a little language but nothing really bad   In one part gremlins smoke and drink beer   The final confrontation with the last gremlin might scare young kids   Overall this movie isnt necessarily scary and a great classic that is definitely worth watching,9
129815,1173번,Gremlins,8,This film is not your typical boygetspet style film  This came out before PG13 ratings  If it was rerated it would be PG13 like Jaws  This film is intense and surprisingly frightening but a well done job by Steven Spielberg  Gremlins are gruesomely killed along with grizzly human deaths and attacks  Humans are bitten scratched and killed by gremlins  Gremlins mainly jump onto humans and cling on and start attacking  A old woman is killed by them thinking theyre demons trying to take her by her elevating chairs wires are tampered with by gremlins and send it spiraling it up the stairs at about 80 mph and send her through a window  Many car crashes  A man tries to lure out a gremlin with a candy bar he is then bitten and is shown with him lying on the ground with a syringe in his butt never revealed if he was killed or unconscious  Gremlins chase a couple into a house with a snowplow they survive  Most human deaths are off screen leaving the viewer to imagine extremely gruesome deaths  A gremlin is killed in a blender green bloodslime spews everywhere  Another one is repeatedly stabbed off screen  A gremlins shoved into a microwave and explodes into a green bloodslime pulp all over the inside of the microwave  Another gremlins decapitated its head is show burning in a fire place  A kid shoots gremlins with a sling shot off his roof  He fights off another one by cutting Christmas lights leaving the gremlin to fall  It doesnt show if the gremlins die from the fall in this scene  Gremlins burn to death and then explode when a gas leak is lit in a movie theater  Gremlins shootthreaten with guns  A man is shot is the arm with a crossbow by Spike and is then attacked with a chainsaw  SPOILER The leader gremlin Spike is killed when exposed to sunlight  His skin melts off revealing muscle tissue his eyes roll into the back of his head and wails in pain  His corpse falls into a fountain his bones jump out and then melt into a goo  SPOILER OVER Gizmo is somewhat of a good role model of how he follows the rules and refuses to eat after midnight unlike the other gremlins  Once the gremlins turn they become creepy instead of cuddly and may scare young children  Some jumpscares  Constant usages of hell dmn god Jesus Jesus Christ etc  But its mild  Gremlins drink like fishes and smoke  Some gremlins are clearly wasted  Worst in sexual stuff is a gremlin flasher but they dont has visible genitals so is not that bad  One kiss scene  Mild flirting  This is a must see film but for tweens and up  Fine for 11,37
129816,1173번,Gremlins,8,Gremlins was the first horrorcomedy that I watched and I watched it 5 years ago and it didnt scare me  It doesnt have any swear words the violence is tamer than most kids films  Good movie for the family,3
129817,1173번,Gremlins,8,It is so cute when Gizmo drives the little car and when he waves the flag I really enjoyed this movie,2
129818,1173번,Gremlins,8,Okay lets be fair this movie was made before pg 13 was invented but that story about that girls father is devastating to me I really hate storys were people get stuck in there own house and no one knows  I watched this movie when I was like 5 or 6 and I dont remember that part I watched it again and that part was just awful I wouldnt recommend it to any one under 11,2
129819,1173번,Gremlins,8,Cool movie  Its not my favorite but my 7 year old brother really likes it  Hes obsessed Summary WARNING SPOILER ALERT,4
129820,1173번,Gremlins,8,Good movie,1
129821,1173번,Gremlins,8,I think gremlins is a good movie but best for tweens and teens because it has quite a bit of violence and scariness but this is my favorite movie of all time,1
130053,1181번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,So the movie started out a little weird but then it was the usual Rocket Racoon Baby Groot StarLord and Gamora  There are also lot of funny scenes with baby Groot   Then they start fighting bad guys  Later they get attacked but win  Character drama happens here and there  There was a lot of family reunion stuff along with references to the 1st movie  I think any 10 year old should be allowed watch this movie,7
130054,1181번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,This was an amazing sequel and yet again it had a great plot great acting but had more humor and scifi action The film does contain plenty of language including several uses of st dk plus more  Also the film contains plenty of suggestive content  This involves sexual tension between several characters and some mild sexual references  However this film does not skimp on the scifi violence and action and definitely amps it up are than the first film  Just like the first film there is plenty of combat swords guns tasers and shootouts and explosions plus a high body count  Overall this is a great sequel that is great for kids 12 and up,7
130055,1181번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,so awesome  there wasnt anything too bad except for a few fks and st  it was also very funny,3
130056,1181번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,I had no idea what was going on This could have been due that I did not watch the first  It was also very silly in a ridiculous way and there were lots of curse words,3
130057,1181번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,ANOTHER CLASSIC action comedy  with great messages burderned by some content still entertaining,2
130058,1181번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,This movie was hillarious and amazing  It had enough sex jokes to give it its rating but it also had some family friendly jokes that the younger aundience would get  There is one part that I would cover my kids ears for  There is one scene when Star Lords father was talking about his mother and how Star Lord came to Be and Drax asked him if he had a penis and full details about them having sex  He also said that his father would tell him stories when he was a child about him making his mother pregnant  Thats really it for the sexual content  Language is really what you would expect to see in a PG13 movie  St Dough bag Dk ass ass hole Bch bastard and danmmit  I think that this movie is appropiate for kid who know what sex and when it is appropiate for it to happen and can hanndle some language  Hope this helped,10
130059,1181번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,i think that this was even better than the first one i also think that that one review about how it was not good for kids and it lowers  a girl self esteem   newsflash  those girls in the club were robots therefore in my opinion  it was fine  by the way i also watche this in the cinema with my younger brothers ages 8 and 5   and they were not affected at all,4
130060,1181번,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,7,This action packed sequel was more funny than the first movie but the plot was more confusing and not quite as interesting  In the first spectacular film I laughed out loud about two times  In this great add on I must have laughed at least ten more  Baby groot was so much more funny than ordinary groot and he had a hilarious role in the opening scene  Chris Pratt had some very good acting and Rocket the raccoon actually got emotional in a few scenes  The profanity in this movie was not as frequent however it ended up having about the same amount  as the first movie because it was very very long  This movie also had some dazzling effects but it was sometimes pretty brutal  The plot of the movie was a little more confusing because the team split up for some of the movie and it kind of changed about one third through the film  Other than the violence I think something to know that this movie has some sexual content some subtle while some is pretty obvious such as one reference to a mans body parts  However if your child is mature than that would not be an issue at all  There were a few sad scenes and as common sense media already stated a character dies but he does it to save his friends which I thought was a good twist  My favorite character was actually not Groot and in fact a new character named Mantis who is an alien who can sense the emotions of living creatures and even change them  The funny thing is that when she is not using her powers she does not understand emotions so she often gets them mixed up such as a character calls her ugly and this makes her happy  Another major role in the movie is the addition of eighties music which is still used very often in this movie  This is a great movie for a family movie night or to see in theaters with a friend  Thank you for reading my review,16
130243,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,This is one of the best marvel movies I saw ever besides ant man it had action laughs and it was just fun a great marvel movie,1
130244,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,This movie is awesome so let a lot of tweens see this  The violence and swearing is like most other superhero movies,2
130245,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,This is the best marvel movie ever Great comedy great action great storyline Im gonna watch Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol  2 tonight  Im hoping its gonna be good,5
130246,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,It is a great movie but there is a lot of violence and swearing  There is a little consumerism when the movie shows that Peters music player is Sony brand,2
130247,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,This movie is unlike most other Marvel movies in that it has a less dark tone  There is more humour than you may expect and there are several cheerful and upbeat songs to relieve moments of tension  However there is also a lot of fantasy violence which is expected from a Marvel movie set in outer space   There is some strong language and one sad moment however the overall message is positive,4
130248,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,A gang of space oddballs unite to save the Galaxy,1
130249,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,Although being an almost Unknown comic  Marvel did a great job bringing it alive in an entertaining humorous film  If I were u I think u should start watching this franchise,2
130250,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,Quality This is a really good movie and I cant wait for its sequel  Just like all marvel movies its hardcore action but its also hilarious seriously apart from the first scene every scene had at least one joke that made me laugh out loud  Great movie entertaining all the way through I really recommend that you see it,3
130251,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,There are lots of reviews that say that this movie has lots of violence sex etc  But there is really not too many things that are or should be concerning  This movie is definitely one of the least violent marvel movies  I do not know why people are saying that there is so much violence and sex and drugs and swearing,4
130252,1182번,Guardians of the Galaxy,8,Great movie but not for the younger children a lot  of swearing in s  t and f  k but very funny and exciting i think this is a movie many people will enjoy,1
130458,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,This movie lacks excessive foul language and sexual themes but is very gruesome and violent  Shows intense bloody and mangled bodies but if you can handle it I would recommend for mature kids 13,2
130459,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,WAY TO VIOLENT NOT JUST NOT FOR KIDS,2
130460,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,This film is fantastic I have nothing bad to say about it  Mel Gibson has definitely proven himself as a high quality director if that was not already evident  Desmond Doss amazing true story is truly inspirational and he represents a good role model for kids  However this movie is way to violent for kids and I would not show it to anyone who is at least 15  The war violence is about as graphic as Saving Private Ryan so it gets pretty bloody apart from that this movie is definitely great for a movie night given that your children can handle the graphic violence,5
130461,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,It is one of Mel Gibson best movies along with passion of the Christ and braveheart  Be AWARE this movie has extremely disturbing violence along with a few swords and a sexual implication,2
130462,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,Hacksaw Ridge is a true story about a man who saved 75 wounded soldiers from battle  The film is extremely violent in a way that kind of affects your soul  There are woundeddead soldiers everywhere there is one shoot of a dead body with intestines coming out  In one scene which I believe was the most affecting and violent scene in the film a mans feet are blown off he looked like someone dipped his feet in a mincer  The man was screaming in pain and some soldiers where saying to let him die  The fact that this stuff actually happens is heartbreaking  This is by far the most violent movie I have ever seen  The profanity isnt so bad  The worst thing said is the Sword  There is one sex scene between a married couple with no nudity and another scene where a naked man is seen training for battle  His bottom is seen about two or three times however it is pretty funny  This movie shows how bad war actually is I usually underestimate the horrors of war since I obviously havent been in a battle  It is mainly about loving your neighbor AND ENEMIES as your self and doing the right thing  If your like me and love war movies then this movie is CERTAINLY for you,14
130463,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,Its a VERY GOOD movie Desmond Doss got the honor he very much deserved But    ITS VERY GORY AND GRUESOME Including a man getting half of his head and brains blown out on to another guy who also gets his chest shot out People flying in the air on fire and screaming in agony a guy on the ground with his legs reduced to strings of blood and flesh and a Japanese leader getting his head chopped off Another thing there is a little bit of nudity not that bad though just a guy naked but it only shows his buttocks  And thats not even all yet its a masterpiece and I highly recommend watching it if your 13 or older  I was 13 when I watched it and I have no regrets watching it at all Well thats all I have to say  I hope this helps you decide to watch it,10
130464,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,This movie is quite good but definitely and this isnt like the exaggerated call of duty reviews  PARENTS IT IS GORY IM NOT JOKING  This movie is extremely gory I know allot of things are but the scenes are quick for the gore they are long  They make sure you can see the gore  So parents definitely 15 or 16  This movie is not for kids it wasnt meant to be  Good movie though,7
130465,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,it is the most inspirational movie you can watch and has amazing role models in it,2
130466,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,This is an amazing film and I would recommend it to everyone  However it does have extreme violence and upsetting scenes that arent appropriate for young teens,2
130467,1189번,Hacksaw Ridge,8,but too much bad violence scenes,1
131156,1206번,Happy Feet,8,I keep seeing all the same things on herea bunch white conservative super religious moms who are flipping out over how offensive and perverted this movie is  Like would you please let it go and shut up already  Lookthe movie has like one or two innuendos in it like a lot of movies do  Get over it  People watching this apparently seem to forget that when the penguins talk about finding a mate they mean finding love and happiness  And when penguins become mates they have sex  Any joke you find too offensive your child will likely be too young to understand  Having sex and mates is what penguins too in the wild  Dont listen to the other reviews telling you how awful this movie is and how its too perverted  The penguins sing to each other  One or two of the lyrics are a bit sexual  Thats about it  Move on and get over it  Your kid will probably enjoy this movie just be aware of a few scary scenes witha leopard seal and youre all good  Please stop getting offended over a bunch of penguins singing old pop love songs to each other  Your kid is eventually going to learn about sex anyway,16
131157,1206번,Happy Feet,8,pengguins shouldnt talk,1
131158,1206번,Happy Feet,8,This my favourite movie of all time,1
131159,1206번,Happy Feet,8,I watched this in school and Ill be honest  it was rather disappointing  While the characters were cute and the message good there were not just innuendos but scenes entirely centered around penguins mating  Personally I feel like the adult humer was a bit over the top,3
131160,1206번,Happy Feet,8,This movie is simply adorable  Lots of cute penguin power with a powerful message of being unique  Definitely a great movie for families  WARNING Only a smidge of scarinessintense scenes  Movie focused around penguins finding mates  film suitable for older children,5
131161,1206번,Happy Feet,8,I saw this movie when I was only three and loved the singing dancing and animals  The message convey in the story is very true in reality today  The songs are live songs so yes they have sexual refreances but the kids wont catch on unless you make a big deal about it  The antichristinan message is not what the movie show rather that believing that someone that doesnt nessassery follow the guidelines is causing all the trouble is very wrong and that everyone is different their own speical way  Perfect for young viewers and older viewers as well  Plus mating is nature stop making a huge deal about it  All animals do it and alot sing to get a mate and keep the circle of life going,7
131162,1206번,Happy Feet,8,Parents if youre are bringing your child to see this movie I think my opinion you should  Why You may ask because theyre children and  the adult jokes will just fly over their heads and they shouldnt be scared of the movie I read that in the parents review its a freaking kids movie Theres nothing to be afraid of And if they do get scared just wait until theyre older,5
131163,1206번,Happy Feet,8,I saw this movie with my family at home and I just couldnt believe all the innuendos packed into this kids movie  It made me extremely uncomfortable  There was no reason for the filmmakers to include so much inappropriate stuff in what could have otherwise been an innocent fun kids movie  This stuff wont just fly over kids heads  Theyll be able to tell by their parents shocked faces that this isnt something they should be watching  DO NOT watch  Very disappointing  I really do think that the only people who should be watching this movie are adults or very mature teens   But even then who would want to watch it anyway Along with the innuendos there are also many racial stereotypes and the movie portrays humans as these monsters that are destroying the planet  All in all this movie is so filled with bad things that no kid will ever get the intended message of being yourself ,11
131164,1206번,Happy Feet,8,This is a KIDS Movie  Bad Parents and some kids,2
131472,1217번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,This film has an interesting storyline but I think its quite gory for younger kids  Ron coughs up slugs and words are painted in red on the walls  Also there is blood on the sword when Harry stabs the basilisk and blood flowing out when Harry stabs a book,3
131473,1217번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,This movie is amazing and it is so cool to watch Harry find out more and more about the wizarding world  Another good thing is that the book is short so they can literally fit everything into the movie,2
131474,1217번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,Yes I know only one scary bit and one cringey bit the scary bit is where the camera is shaking and Rons youngest sister was riting on the walls with blood and the cringey bit is the Phoenix pecking the eyes out of the snake  kinda of camera kinda not in a shadow I dont remember swear words they might be I dont remember and the whomping willow might scare some young kids and other Bits like Children being super scared by the snake including Collin and also Malloy gets hit on the head with a plank of wood and Ron gets sick and like spit slugs Because he had a broken wand and backfired also gildory Lockhart took his wand and he lost hes mind and never know who he was forever  he is a conman,1
131475,1217번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,Chamber of Secrets is grossly underrated  This is a more bloody violent adventure but nonetheless one told beautifully,2
131476,1217번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,This is ok to me it couldnt be any more innapropriate than the first,1
131477,1217번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,It was a really good movie  You like it two But be careful because some scenes give me the wiggles because they are scary Right I hope you like it  Well bye dudes  I just love it when I fly in the ocean,7
131478,1217번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,I preferred the movies while Chris Columbus was directing  They were kinda more childcentered  So 1 and 2 were easier to watch for me but I like all of them  There were a lot of funny things like Fred and Georges faces when they got yelled at for flying the car  And Rons when he got the Howler  The darker and scarier aspects arent that bad either  But nothing can beat the book and thats why theres four stars  There are great messages and role models like all the books and movies  And the violence is very light,9
131479,1217번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,I really liked the book so I decided to watch the movie  I loved it although I pictured a lot of things differently in my head  There was a part near the end that was really scary  All the special effects were really cool But it is very long  Overall I think this is a good movie for families with kids 8 and up due to some scary scenes  Thanks for reading this review and I hope you try this movie,7
131480,1217번,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,7,It is not too scary but the last 15 minutes are scary you may want to skip the last 15 minutes,1
131690,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,I had it for movie night and me and my little brother both loved it  There were only a couple of nasty bits,2
131691,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,Read the book then see it  It is dark and not vary good fore under 13,2
131692,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,Really good movie but it leaves out a lot  Its a little scary someone cuts off his hand harry gets stabbed in the arm and a boy is killed so its definitely not for younger kids,2
131693,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,This is a great movie but there are a few scary scenes,1
131694,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,My sister watched this movie when she was 5 years old  If you watched Prisoner of Askaban you can certainly watch this movie  It is a great movie about teamwork and helping a friend in need  It does show an unconscious body and does have the killing curse in it  There are two final scenes in the film that you have to worry about  One includes Harry and a boys father screaming in peril after his son died  Another is that there is a scene SPOILER ALERT where mad eye moody turns back into his real form without the polyjuce potion and there is a brief moment where his transformation is disturbing  Other than those two I think youll be OK,8
131695,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,It is the BEST movie ever my little brother is 6 and never looked away Some intense scenes and suspense but amazing movie,2
131696,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,8,I think that the harry potter series are the best books ever written,1
131706,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,Not too much from the book version appeared in this movie  I was really looking forward to the veelas but guess what It got skipped Another major thing they left out were the characters Ludo Bagman and Winky the house elf   I think you should read the book first  Although many parts werent used this film was incredible and we all loved it  Nothing too scary at least not for me and my 5 year old brother,7
131707,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,This is a good movie  I watched the whole Harry Potter series when I was like 10  Watch it with you kids if you think theyll get too scared or skip over the bad parts  If things are inappropriate most likely your kids will not get it unless theyre old enough too  Parents sensor kids too much sometimes,5
131708,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,This movie is epic  I think there is to much violence for younger kids but not much blood,2
131709,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,Scary Most of this movie is kid appropriate but the end is very very scary Good movie though and kids 9  14 will enjoy it,3
131710,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,HARRY POTTER 4 contains mild violence  Thats all parents will need to know,2
131711,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,Although its a bit violent I think that kids will see this movie without your permission I recommend you to watch it with them so you can talk about the message in this movie instead of making them watched behind you backs that is way much worse than watching a bit of violence also kids have seen much more violence than in this movie,1
131712,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,I watched this with my family and I chose not to watch harry getting sliced of the cutting off the hand but honestly it wasnt that scary at all  My sister is 7 and she watched it all,2
131713,1218번,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,6,I think that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was too scary for my little brother who was 4 and was scared in his bed after watching  Spoiler alert The part with the dark lord was a very dark scene and when the dark lord came out of the cauldron it was too scary,2
132024,1219번,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,Harry potter  and the HalfBlood prince book and movie was incredibly awesome We can relate a lot from Harry Potter and learn  great lessons from the series,2
132025,1219번,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,but its ok for what it is  See you on a two parter review,2
132026,1219번,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,I love the Harry Potter books but when it comes to the movies its a complete different story  Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince dived into more of a romance story  Sixteen year olds finding true love and all  But was it a good love story between Harry and Ginny in the movies No Seriously they made Ginny almost emotionless  Book Ginny would never do a thing like having awkward kiss moments and tie shoelaces at the weirdest moment  Not the actresss fault because she did what was on the script  Not just Ginny but Ron too  The screenwriter and director mustve hated Ron because now they give all the credit to Hermione for comforting Harry and Ron just sits there daydreaming at the last scene,10
132027,1219번,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,I thing that this was a great movie It had a good plot line and everything  I saw this when I was about 11 or 10 and I loved it  Now I was reading some of the parent reviews and I thought that it was weird that they thought someone being killed on screen was bad  Now I get your point but it showed no blood or any odious sign that they were dead other than a lifeless body I think this is a great movie for kids 10 because of what I just described  Thanks for reading,7
132028,1219번,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,I think 9 is fine if they are watching with a parent or someone above 12  This movie has violance but not to muchto be scared of  Their is some kissing but the plot is immpecable  I love this movie so much    its my favorite one  I think the whole harry potter franchise should be 10 it isnt bad at all,5
132029,1219번,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,8,Harry Potter and the HalfBlood Prince is so good only one thing that scared me was the  Inferi   Dumbledores death was also a little scary but over all this is a good movie,3
132394,1220번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,Should be watched  A bit of violence,2
132395,1220번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,I hate this movie  It is very scary  DO NOT WATCH IT,3
132396,1220번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,When writing the book this was my least favorite because to show Harrys puberty she spend hundreds of thousands of words just on the drama in Harrys emotions  But well skip to the movie,2
132397,1220번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,I think this film is very fun to watch with families and has an intense storyline  Personally its one of my least favourites from the series but its still amazing  Should definitely watch,3
132398,1220번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,Ohmygodsogood Even though it was darker than the previous films you find out more about Voldemort  Harry gets angry but his friends help him  Continues the recurring theme of friendship and defeating evil  Ron swears a loooot again but nothing too bad  Again soooo gooooood 10 at least very scary the death eaters and Voldemort kinda freaked me out but thats just me ,7
132399,1220번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,This is a epic movie but there is quite a scary bit near the end with Lord Voldemort  but if you look closely he looks quite funny  There is a new character introduced called Luna Lovegood,2
132400,1220번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,This movie is so good The tension started in the very begging and you want to watch more and more  This movie is appropriate for ages 8 and up  It is outrageous that CSM rated this film 12 and up,4
132401,1220번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,Some violence and fantasy but overall its a great film and I love it   Good female role model in Hermione too,2
132402,1220번,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,8,Harry sauve    de detraqueur le minister de la magie ne le croi pas Voldemort est de retourune nouvelle gerre commenceDombeldor cre L ordre du phnix,1
133815,1250번,Hercules,7,Lighthearted but scary stuff is too much for littlest kids,1
133816,1250번,Hercules,7,I have no Idea how adults come up with the gory and gruesome ratings They is simply animated figthing I think a two year old would find this scary,1
133817,1250번,Hercules,7,This movie was incredible I really like the graphics and editing  I give it a 5star WHAT PARENTS NEED TO KNOW Its a great movie but not so much for young children  I would recommend at least 7 and older to watch  There are partial scenes where Herculess trainer Phil treats girls in a nonappropriate way  Although you cant get mad at Disney  The movie setting is located in ancient Greece so its very common to see things like that  There are scary scenes where Hades forces monsters and terrifying creatures to try to kill Hercules  Which they all end up failing  There is another scene where Hades tricks Hercules into saving two little boys trapped under a rock  The two little boys are actually Hadess helpers Pain and Panic  Of course Hercules ends up getting the rock off of them but then we see a huge monster appear out of the cave and Hercules ends up having to battle it  The monsters or so called Titans are released by Hades which then he makes them try to kill Zeus so he can rule  These monsters might come off as scary to some children  Throughout the whole movie there is no sign of blood  Just bruises and scratches  Some children might find it scary when people die  Their soul comes out of their body and sometimes screams  When Hades enters the underworld he has to feed this threeheaded dog  This might be scary  MY RECOMMENDATION If you are a child 6 years old or under please watch with parent supervision  Other than that it is my favorite movie and I definitely recommend watching it,24
133818,1250번,Hercules,7,This Disney movie is   different,1
133819,1250번,Hercules,7,A not sensitive kid could watch this  Hades is not scary because he is too funny I love his hair too lol  Hercules is tryna find where he belongs and then hes like GASP IMMA GOD or something and meets Meg  Shes disturbingly skinny btw but nice  The little narrator ladies are very cute  Phil chases ladies but hes cool  xd  You should watch One violent scene is when Hercules chops off a hydra head and then more grow back and he almost dies but you can skip over that little part  ,9
133820,1250번,Hercules,7,So I love this movie a lot but its definitely not for younger kids  It had a great story but got really off topic from Greek mythology and could be offensive to that culture  The violence could be scary if a little kid watches it  Also Hercules boyfriend  the best Disney character in my opinion is very sexual and cracks some jokes that are funny but most kids wont understand  This movie has a lot of positive sides and good messages but the violence and sexuality might be too much for some kids,5
133821,1250번,Hercules,7,Loved this film and its perseverance towards what it wants to be  Greek Gods is the way,2
133822,1250번,Hercules,7,Very good Disney classic should be on the low end of PG  This movie is not light on peril and being scary  Not for the littlest to watch,3
133823,1250번,Hercules,7,Im 15 and this has to be my favourite Disney  movie I have absolutely loved it to bits ever since I first saw it,2
134376,1272번,Hocus Pocus,8,As a SUPER fan of Hocas Pocas is the best Halloween movie ever  As everyone has already said it has a lot of the word virgin thrown in  The witch gets a little cuddly with a bus driver but it is honestly not that bad and is comical  If your sensitive with gore you might think that witches talking about tourchering and sucking childrens souls out is bad  But even that is not bad at all  Scary funny and awesome,6
134377,1272번,Hocus Pocus,8,Parents should know,1
134378,1272번,Hocus Pocus,8,This is a great movie  I first watched it when I was 5 and my 3 year old brother watched it with me  Me and him both loved it  When I was little I didnt really remember them talking about virgin,4
134379,1272번,Hocus Pocus,8,For most people Halloween is just Halloween but for some people in Salem Massachusetts its a bit more  The Sanderson sisters are a legend to the people in Salem  It is said that they sucked the life force out of kids to retain their youth  They were caught one day and were hung but it is said that a virgin will bring them back  This movie is a fun Halloween movie for the whole family  There is mild violence but I think most older kidstweens should be able to handle it  There is no sex but there are a few references to being a virgin and a few other mild sex innuendos  Most kids however would not notice it  Mild language is also present in the movie  All in all Hocus Pocus is a really cute movie  I definitely recommend it for anyone during the Halloween season,11
134380,1272번,Hocus Pocus,8,This movies is about 3 witches who come back after 300 years when a boy lights a candle,1
134381,1272번,Hocus Pocus,8,Hocus Pocus is an okay movie  I thought it was pretty funny and sometimes cool  The movie is about 3 kids who go to an old shack that belonged to three witches long ago  They light a candle and the witches come back to life wanting to suck childrens souls out to regain their youth  It is a fun adventure movie but can be scary at times  Fortunately the scariness is funny and not like the scariness in horror movies like Stephen Kings It,6
134382,1272번,Hocus Pocus,8,There is alot of Sx cuz maxs little sister mentions something about something max said that is weird the Madonna outfit is also weird and an elderly couple get in a fight because one of them dances with the blonde witch,1
134383,1272번,Hocus Pocus,8,I think this is a great film but wouldnt recommend it to people who dont want their child to ask what a virgin is because there i slot of talk about that  There is also a part when the kids try to burn the witches to death  I think that this is a great film and you should defiantly watch this,3
134384,1272번,Hocus Pocus,8,It is really funny but there are some scary scenes like there is a zombie that gets his head torn off but still I think it is mostly funny and it is not very scary at all,1
134600,1276번,Home Alone,8,This is a great comedy classic it includes violence and some language,1
134601,1276번,Home Alone,8,0,1
134602,1276번,Home Alone,8,so so good but there are burglurs and the sound of a gunshot and traps over all it is a great movie,1
134603,1276번,Home Alone,8,Fun Movie  There is a spider  Some swearing like st bitch and ass,3
134604,1276번,Home Alone,8,It is a great movie but too much swearing   WAY too much  but it  has a good moral,2
134605,1276번,Home Alone,8,and i recommend it for all ages though the only bad effects is the fire and the iron and buckets though i bet young viewers would laugh,1
134606,1276번,Home Alone,8,Super funny holidaythemedslapstickcomedymovie  Great main character and creative plot  Some of the slapstick parts might be disturbing to really young kids,3
134607,1276번,Home Alone,8,Super funny language is fine and the violence is funny   Honestly this is the best holiday movie ever,2
134608,1276번,Home Alone,8,GREAT,2
134642,1276번,Home Alone,8,It is a great movie and all with funny humor and situations but even with actually especially with the first say ten minutes there is a lot of disrespect going on in the Mccalister home I probably spelled that wrong  No body seems to like Kevin as they call him names like disease jerk le incompetent and so on  There are a few mild swearing as well  Its really not hard to see why they hate Kevin because hes really a brat  He gets angry about stupid things and even calls his mom dummy and comments Families suck He of course learns his lesson and for the rest of the movie the swearing is taken down a notch as well as the insults  The traps he sets for the burglars are comical but sometimes very painful to watch  Most kids might laugh at it but others might just cover their eyes  Overall I think its a good movie just be careful what age you decide to show it to,9
134643,1276번,Home Alone,8,This movie is quite violent at the end with the villains getting burned hit in the head falling down stairs and more  I first watched this when i was six and I was terrified of it  Lots of namecalling and some swearing but there arent any movies without that these days  Ive watched it about ten times none of them because I had to watch it in school or anything and I only watched the Grinch  liveaction twice once in school  Not the best role models but Kevin does tend to be quite independant,5
134644,1276번,Home Alone,8,Words like Hll ss And Dmn  If your kid has heard these words its fine  If not maybe skip it  They also say Shut up Les incompetent Your kids probably wouldnt understand that Stupid and say Ya filthy animal ,4
134645,1276번,Home Alone,8,This movie is really funny and its one of my favs  There isnt a lot of cursing but there is one scene where Santa is smoking a cigarette  It gets violent a little more than half way through the movie but its the best Part A must see,4
134646,1276번,Home Alone,8,Great Family Christmas movie probably saw it the first time when I was 6 years old  There is a lot of comedic violence and a few scenes where 8 year old Keven looks at his 14 year old brother Buffs Playboy magazines  But other than that a great funny entertaining movie the entire family will enjoy,3
134647,1276번,Home Alone,8,This film is so funny  It has cartoonish violence and slapstick comedy  I watch this most Christmass and I never get bored of it  It has occasional use of mild swearing and may be unsuitable for younger children  Love this film,6
134648,1276번,Home Alone,8,This is a mustwatch Watch this movie you will cry for how funny it is This is a great movie for kids  family Although if your child is scared of bad guys sneaking into the house they may want to wait longer because that is what happens although Kevin the main character beats them up and tries to get rid of them in funny ways,4
134649,1276번,Home Alone,8,To be honestthis movie is really funny Nothing is really major except for language,2
134650,1276번,Home Alone,8,it is a great  film for kid 11    It is a comedy that is so funny  it will knock your socks of it has violence language  and no sex  you better watch  soon,4
134651,1276번,Home Alone,8,A great Christmas  classic  It includes funny fails  Tricky traps and endless fun Beware of the language Kevin is mean at first  We dont like when he calls his mom a bad name   Good for responsible 8 year olds,7
134652,1276번,Home Alone,8,Fun and quick witted Caper that will introduce kids to more advanced Heist movies,1
134653,1276번,Home Alone,8,This movie is a survival story about being left home  Kevin the main character had an annoying family and wanted to be home alone  The next day the family left home for Paris in a hurry but forgot Kevin  He began to learn what life was like alone along with the pesky Wet Bandits  At the end the family returned and everyone was happy,5
134654,1276번,Home Alone,8,This is not a bad movie  I love this movie but their is so much profanity I feel like it cannot be just flown by like it is no big deal  The way the parents and the kids talk to each other is unacceptable I would still watch it but mute some of the parts where you can tell profanity can happen,4
134655,1276번,Home Alone,8,Fantastic funny Christmas classic,1
134656,1276번,Home Alone,8,Home Alone is an awesome movie  It isnt violent except for when the kid is fighting two burglars  It has one scary part where his furnace makes a creepy noise  There is also some mild cursing  Other then that it is fine for your kid 8 and up,5
134657,1276번,Home Alone,8,A lot of humor but it can be very scary and inappropriate scenes If you dont like swearing and violence you shouldnt watch this movie,1
134658,1276번,Home Alone,8,Age Rating My Opinion  PG  13 A,1
134659,1276번,Home Alone,8,this was a great movie but can be violent including guns creepy movies  And very frequent language,2
135189,1305번,Hotel Transylvania,6,This movie is really good I think that its hilarious and it has a really good message Ok so violencetheres really no violence besides the scary face thing that dracula does  Sexy stuff none besides two TINY kisses  Language none  Consumerism none  Drinking none  Great movie ,9
135190,1305번,Hotel Transylvania,6,Greta movie for all families  I went to see this movie with my family and I thought This is gonna be a stupid little kid movie   But the movie was awesome  I normally enjoy a good PG13 comedy but this was an awesome movie  And a shout out to autisticcaregvr Really You have nothing better to do You make it sound like paranormal activity or a slasher movie Parents Do not listen to his review  This movie was meant to be a movie about a coming of age movie  Not a demonic movie,9
135191,1305번,Hotel Transylvania,6,This is a cute movie but the kids 5 and under might not get he humor  There is some love not an overdose more like Disney Princess and a lot of stars in this movie The reason why I put language is because of the slight potty humor  teeheehee but at least the boys will be happy Overall a really sweet family movie and a great addition to the movie collection,3
135192,1305번,Hotel Transylvania,6,Vampires Bloodsuckers only make appearances in Rrated and PG13rated movies  Ive never seen a vampire movie for kids but I didnt like it  Sexy and I Know It by LMFAO is played in some scenes and I despise LMFAO,5
135193,1305번,Hotel Transylvania,6,hotel transilvania is a funny movie about draculas daughter who turns 118 years old she wants too see the world and see goes in the end hotel transilvania is a movie about a bond between a daughter and her father,1

135196,1305번,Hotel Transylvania,6,Hotel Transylvainia is suitable for kids 7 and up with some minor scary parts,1
135197,1305번,Hotel Transylvania,6,dracula was funnymavis is hotjohnathan can be annoying at times and the other characters were generally likeable except for the witches and especially the stupidugly unappealing zombies,1
135198,1305번,Hotel Transylvania,6,It is a really good movie   It is really funny  I saw it two times and it even made my parents laugh out loud   My mom covered my eyes when she saw kissing   I took her hands off my eyes   There is a little story where there is fire   Also the mom in the movie gets killed but the dad remains alive   There is some scary music   For little kids there might be some scary parts but otherwise I think it is a really good movie,9
135390,1320번,How to Train Your Dragon,7,This movie is great for kids with imagination or really anyone  It serves as a reminder that social outcast is no good and shows some kickass dragons along the way  If you havent seen it yet I dont know what your doing Give it a watch with your kid or by yourself you wont regret it,4
135391,1320번,How to Train Your Dragon,7,I think that for 10 and up This shows a lot of caring and kind  It is also good for history,2

135396,1320번,How to Train Your Dragon,7,I have been watching this movie since it came out when I was four years old  I really like that even when every viking expected the main character to kill a dragon he was brave and refused to do it  There was a cheesy crush that the main character had on a girl  The three minor things that I would warn about are 1  Teens talk about the scars they hope to get by battling dragons  2  The main characters Dad gifts him a helmet made from his Mothers old breastplate  3  There were some filler words like the common sense review said such as Thor almighty  I recommend this great movie to anybody who is thinking about watching it,10
135397,1320번,How to Train Your Dragon,7,The end was scary so if you have any little kids ask them if they need to take a break   It has some sad parts but this is a kids movie so it will have a happy ending,2
135829,1331번,I Am Legend,8,Great movie but the bleakest film I have ever seen  The CGI was poor but ok  The film didnt make me feel great to be alive  This only has jump scares and not much gory violence  Good but bleak,5

135831,1331번,I Am Legend,8,This film was so good better than expected to be honest I found this pretty emotional like when they all die i cried soo much  it was violent but personally it did not scare me at all just a little violent  Anyway a definite watch oh it also depends on you wether you like this type of stuff for me it was a no scare but if you dont like things that jump out id say it was a no for you,2
135832,1331번,I Am Legend,8,this movie is very violent,1
135833,1331번,I Am Legend,8,This is good I just got this on blu ray at target for 7 50  I watched it and liked it  I thought some scenes were kind of scary  No people get shown eaten  Will does shoot zombies sometimes with no blood  There is no language or sex in this movie  Will is a good role model  I would not recommend this film to kids under 12,9
135834,1331번,I Am Legend,8,intense and very scary but good  some disturbing and sad scenes  also some jumpscenes,3
135835,1331번,I Am Legend,8,I think this is a very good movie  It is for kids from 10  It isnt too fright as they say  It just haves a lot of suspence  The mutants arent that scary  Kids WILL like this movie,6

136083,1346번,Ice Age,8,The movie was terrible for me  I think it is only suitable for under 5 year olds who dont understand it and over 8 year olds who are already older  I was very sad about some scenes  I will never forget the movie,4

136094,1346번,Ice Age,8,DO NOT let your children watch this terrible movie it truly is an abomination  The Ice Age Baby is maybe the worst thing ever and teaches a terrible messages  Parents should not even watch this they would  probably die,3
136095,1346번,Ice Age,8,I enjoy this film and think the cgi holds up  Has some violence but overall an enjoyable story that the family can watch  I thought it was good but surprised how big the franchise is now,3
136096,1346번,Ice Age,8,This movie is one of the best movie I seen on 2001 Its so unique and it really put the message out and what do you do for a family or your friends that you protect them from danger I think this is a really nice message to this and the movie is so awesome and the best I have seen when I was young,3
136097,1346번,Ice Age,8,Its a toddler movie theres no other way to put it  But the reason for 5 stars is because its one of them special kids movies that all ages can watch  Be curious with toddlers of 2 or under though there is some scary scenes,3
136098,1346번,Ice Age,8,I like this movie  It is about animals adventure,2
136099,1346번,Ice Age,8,Sort of cute movie but Manny is so annoying  Its a pretty cliche movie  Manny reminds me of Calliou and it sounds like his nose is clogged up the whole time    I strongly dislike this movie but the other ones are ok  Sid is just gross he makes me naseous but    MANNY RUINS IT ALL Do not watch,6
136100,1346번,Ice Age,8,okay this was one of the most boringest movies of all time its just so stupid dont watch this stupid movie I shut it off in the first 30 minutes  dont waste your money or time watching this,2
136101,1346번,Ice Age,8,Title says all,1
137403,1390번,Inside Out,8,When I saw the trailerI thought it was boringbut my parents really wanted to watch the movie in theatersso we went there to watch the movie and let me tell youit was amazing I watched it like 3 times now thanks to Netflix  I Like the Animation and story because it just explores your inner emotionsand family  I had a few giggles and laugh but also a little tear at the end  I Highly recommend it to all families World wide Because its my favorite Pixar Movie So far,6
137404,1390번,Inside Out,8,Cute with kind and friendly characters,1
137405,1390번,Inside Out,8,Some mild swearing such as stupid idt etc  and unkindness  One scene involves Riley shouting shut up at her parents,3
137406,1390번,Inside Out,8,Do you really want to teach your childern to get bad habits like swearing when they are angry Would you want them to learn sexist stereotypes trust me you do not want to watch time movie,2
137407,1390번,Inside Out,8,Completely appropriate for almost any age  Beautiful animation good lesson  I love this movie,3
137408,1390번,Inside Out,8,If it is not as good as Toy Story 3 or Lion King it is a close 3rd or 2nd this is one of my favorite films  Kids will love the colorful backgrounds and funny humor and middle and older people will love the powerful messages and jokes  Best Pixar film you can watch it now,3
137409,1390번,Inside Out,8,I thought it was a good movie it was fun funny and also has a good message that both kids and adults can understand and like even if the message is deep  One part that parents might want to know about is one of the core memories include a babys bum being showed with her diaper on her head  It is only shown for a couple seconds as her goofball island part of herself,3
137410,1390번,Inside Out,8,Inside Out is pretty good but sometimes I just think about it like I do with The Good Dinosaur and think    why Dont get me wrong it is a good movie and had good scenes here and there but the whole idea of Inside Out is just weird  It is still kind of creative but I feel like this was the point that Pixar was running out of ideas  It also raises some unanswered questions  The emotions are in peril throughout the movie but that raises the question Can they die If they die how would that effect Riley Bing Bong died so does that mean the emotions could die  Another question I thought was near the end  In the end the mind workers installed a new console for Rileys teen years  It raised the question What happened when they took out Rileys old console That just feels weird and dark  Even though this was Pixars meh its still better than a LOT of Pixar films  Toy Story A Bugs Life Monsters Inc  Finding Nemo The Incredibles Toy Story 3 Cars 2 and Monsters University were ALL worse films than Inside Out  Still Pixar didnt need to make this  If they were gonna make it they couldve at least added more to it,13
137411,1390번,Inside Out,8,I watched this movie and I think its good but BingBong Rileys imaginary friend that is not an emotion in the movie gets forgotten and at the end and all the Emotions are happy but noone knows what happens to BingBong and if hes even happy  Noone knows if Joy kept her promise  I think its quite sad and probably for 9 yrs  up a bit too sad for small kids  It shows what puberty could be like and it kind of scared me  Also there is talk about using swear words plus there is a bit of puberty stuff  I found that the part when Riley decides to LEAVE HOME which I found SCARY is too much for little kids to process  One last thing is that there is one scene is where toddler Riley shows her bum to everyone who is watching  DONT SHOW TO LITTLE KIDS,9
138734,1408번,Iron Man,8,My brother and I where covering our eyes the entire time,2
138735,1408번,Iron Man,8,AmazingOne of the best MCU movies there are,1
138736,1408번,Iron Man,8,I love this movie Iron Man is my favorite Marvel character  He is a playboy so there is some suggestive stuff he says but it would probably go over their heads  There is one scene where they are rolling around in bed but nothing is shown and it is quick and skips to morning  There is swearing but not too much for a mature kid  And the violence is not too bad again for a mature kid,5
138737,1408번,Iron Man,8,Yeah there is some violence and me and my older sister did have to skip the part where Tony and Christine are in bed but I would say its a great film Also I kind of disagree with what Common Sense Media had to say about the bad guys being clearly evil in regards to Obadiah Stane because at first glance hes a very nice man who cares for and wants to help Tony  Nevertheless this is a very great movie indeed,3
138738,1408번,Iron Man,8,I think that iron man is a good movie but it was kind of boring in the middle  I didnt see this one first but it was good  Violence was kind of heavy with a few deaths and blood and a shooting  Sex wasnt much beside the part where the main character has a hookup,4
138739,1408번,Iron Man,8,Iron Man was a amazing movie Rdj Robert Downey Jr does an amazing turn on iron man  Some innuendo as flirting bare backs kissing and assumed sex  Violence is very realistic with terrorism kids held at gunpoint torture among Tony Stark and terrorists  Some alcohol drunken at parties and Tony Stark drinks whiskey very frequently  Tony gambles and flirts at a casino  Iron mans suit is packed full of tank missiles lasers and machine guns  Tony best friend betrays him and uses his technology against him  Overall amazing comic book film with violence and some innuendo,9
138740,1408번,Iron Man,8,I personally love this movie  Its not horribly violent though there are some scenes that I would not recommend a younger kid see  Its funny too  A great movie to watch if youre new the Marvel universe,4
138741,1408번,Iron Man,8,As the first movie in the MCU this one is a favorite for most  It relies less on CGI and more on true facetoface fight scenes  Very stylish  Of course Robert Downey Jr  is the PERFECT man to play the part  Violence isnt too bad but enough to keep the plot rolling  Humor at its finest  Language was mild mostly strong at some parts  Sex was iffy girls wearing croptops and lingerie when drinking with Tony Stark and a few crude statements nothing that would make your kids questions anything  Tony has a reputation as a playboy  Drinking is recreational and mild Tony gets drunk comical but still drunk  A couldbe frightening medical scene  I loved this movie and your kids will too,12
138742,1408번,Iron Man,8,Parents need to know that iron man is a superhero movie that starts it all the MCU  Like all superhero movies there is definitely some intense violence with lots of punching and high tech machines and gun use  There is also quite a bit of war violence on the other hand  There is one scene around 35 seconds of iron man and a random girl making out and implied that they   yeah  Then later appears with barely any clothes  This makes sense later why they put more language and less sexy stuff  Some very mild language including damn one possible a and hell  But he is iron man very funny but may be a iffy choice for young kids Lots of products placements and marvel merchandising,9
139470,1424번,It,8,I watched this movie for the first time just the other day and i anticipated it to be very scarybut i was wrongthe only major bad things are some blood and thats a given with scary movies Also with the swearingyes there are kids swearing but my dad told me that kids would swear in the 80s all of the timewhich is where its set in I am very sensitive to scary stuff because of my anxiety and this was ok for meso just dont watch it if you are a sensitive person,1
139471,1424번,It,8,Right off the bat Im going to say that I say 13 because I watched with friends  My review would probably be different if I watched it alone  I found it kind of scary but being with my friends made it easier  If I were alone Id probably be making this 14 or something  The story is so good and the casting is amazing  Eddie is a sweetheart Ritchie is a king Beverly is a queen and Bill is sweetiepie  Mike and the other dude are kind of lame  Its much less inappropriate than the book  I totally recommend   This was one of my first horror movies and boy was it a great one,10
139472,1424번,It,8,This review has no spoilers  This movie was great and as a horror fan it was even better  I didnt put spoilers in this because i definitely suggest you watch this movie for yourself  Its funny scary kinda suspensful and overall enjoyable  If your over ten and you dont mind scares this is the movie for you,5
139473,1424번,It,8,I was wreally swary I took my 2 year old to see it and they said Best movie EVER  Favourite character was for sure the gay kid he was INSPIWING,2
139474,1424번,It,8,I watched it when I was 11 I thought it was pretty good if your child is scared easily id wait a few years  I love the movie and watch it quite often  Pennywise is a bit creepy for people who do not like clowns  But I would still recommend If you have not watched already I would watch the only part that I wouldnt want little kids to see is when one of the bullys stabs his dad in the neck after pennywise tells him too,5
139475,1424번,It,8,If you say its not scary okay youre fine I hated this movie rude characters young teens say swear words Georgies arm was bitten by Pennywise and a abusing teen girl named Beverley  Pennywise is an Alien dressed up as a clown not his species is a clown  Imagine that It was a SciFi horror movie  These clowns are creepy or not too creepy Not for school people  These creators dont know when they can allowed to say swear words  I thought it was PG13 but its R  It has tons of blood and gore  I love Halloween but this was so trash If you love this movie then shame on you Just stop loving this movie Maybe Rebecca Spark will probably hate this,12
139476,1424번,It,8,Honestly I dont know who would want to watch such movies  The creepy Halloween decorations they have out in the stores scares ME a little still but Im just a sensitive teen,2
139477,1424번,It,8,The origonal IT is ok for kids but not the new one because  it to violent there you go dudes,1
139478,1424번,It,8,yes  IT wouldnt be the best movie to pick if your afraid of clowns but if your not I think IT would be perfect the movie is about 7 outcasts who got bullied previously  fighting this bully but then one of there brothers Georgie denbrough  bills brother goes missing  taken from pennywise the 7 losers go out searching for Georgie and fighting pennywise  the contest behind the movie is to be who you want to be and know that you dont have to be popular to be the star  I will say throughout the movie there is a lot of language and talk on health and there isnt a lot of blood  the movie has the perfect amount of horror and comedy  I personally love the film with a passion,3
139479,1424번,It,8,This movie is great except for the language I think thats why they rated it R  Violence is like in a superhero movie and the little bit of sexual content is supposed to be comical,1
139713,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,Ive seen some kidsteens say its one of the worst movies  Okay I can respect that Holly R says this movie is just creepy,3
139714,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,These reviews you see around you are by a bunch of snowflakes who cant take anything slightly scary  For me this is a classic Ive loved since I was 4 and something that families will be happily watching together  Everything is great from the visuals the character design the stopmotion animation the simple but fun songs and great messages of family friendship and conquering your fears  This movie managed to elevate and expand upon the original book that Ill always see this as the definitive version of the story  Same with director Selicks other triumphant classics of Coraline and The Nightmare Before Christmas,5
139715,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,This movie was terrible It was so boring,1
139716,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,Its on the older side of animation but overall and funny movie great for kids 8  This movies does contain the word ass but thats about it for language  Can scare young or sensitive children  Very little sexual references the centipede flirts with the spider repetitively there is also a scene where the cricket asks the centipede its longitude and latitude but the centipede mistakes the question as asking him the size of his yknow  The centipede replies to the cricket with thats very personality information,5
139717,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,Ive loved this movie since I saw it when I was 8,1
139718,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,I like this movie but I dont think it is appropriate for kids 9 because the aunts try to kill James with an axe and they also abuse him,1
139719,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,As a Tim Burton fan i think the movie was awsome a piece of art,1
139720,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,Okay so first let me say the book is AMAZING  Fun heartwarming and just weird enough to be memorable  The movie though   ugh  First the beginning is TERRIFYING  I wasnt allowed to watch this when I was little and I see why  I mean a giant rhinoceros appears from the sky and basically murders a kids parents leaving him in the hands of his abusive and repulsive aunts  Family entertainment at its best  And the rest of the movie just doesnt make sense  I fell asleep partway through and when I woke up they were   in space And yet I honestly dont feel like I missed out on much  Even the songs are weird somewhat tuneless and add nothing to the plot  I USUALLY love Tim Burton movies but this one was just a disappointment  I only gave it that extra star because the grasshopper glow worm and centipede are hilarious and add just a little whimsy to an otherwise unsettling and skippable movie,13
139721,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,A great movie but the Aunts are really mean and we dont like that bit but I know that its only for he movie and they arent like that in real life and they are just acting  I really like when James is in the peach and having the adventures,2
139722,1429번,James and the Giant Peach,8,This movie was great   I would have to say that the bugs arent really creepy but thats just my opinion   The movie was an interesting kind of weird   My brother who is 6 says the movie was good and actiony,4
140099,1436번,Jaws,8,this movie is not scary  I heard that some people were afraid to have a BATH after this movie what  there is only a little blood and the scariest thing was hoping my mom would not come in on those parts,3
140100,1436번,Jaws,8,So many parents who watched it in their day  Talk this movie up so much  It is not scary and I think a baby could handle this  But some things to realise is that their are complete idiots in this movie and I know people allergic to jerks  If you thought that was real you shouldnt be thinking about watching jaws ,4
140101,1436번,Jaws,8,Jaws although being old is very scary  There are TONS of graphic shark attacks including a man being eaten alive while he screams in agne and spits up blood  There is also a scene where a sunken boat is found and a dead mans head appears without an eye  Although it isnt that realistic it is incredibly disturbing  The first scene also shows a girl getting naked and then jumping into the water  Jaws is violent but one of the best movies I have ever seen,6
140102,1436번,Jaws,8,This was a fantastic movie Im not a fan of anything bloody but I really did enjoy watching it I think you should wait until 11 or 12 depending on what you can handle  The first scene in the movie is a girl who is attacked by a shark and then a child does which is really sad and we do see some remains of a shark victim that is disturbing dead people and a really disturbing scene of a man tragically be torn to bits by a shark on a boat but other than these things it isnt too horrible  A few jump scares but nothing sexual or to harsh  I just think parents should watch with their children but other than that a pretty good movie,6
140103,1436번,Jaws,8,I think Jaws is a really good movie to watch with family  It can be a little scary at times but it is over all not that scary  There is not that much gore or very graphic deaths  I think it is a great movie but if your kid is more scared of the ocean and sharks then I would say this movie is not for them,4
140104,1436번,Jaws,8,This movies special effects are amazing  The first time I watched this movie I didnt really know what to expect but I actually thought that everything in the movie couldve actually happened  This movie does show blood and people by the shark though the blood is basically only in the water  The movie also shows the characters drinking   I think this movie should probably be watched by 12 because there are a lot of kids who arent exposed to certain things like drinking till theyre older  Over all I think this is an amazing movie 1010 would recommend,6
140105,1436번,Jaws,8,Jaws is an excellent shark film but be aware there is blood violence and smoking  This classic movie does not disappoint as Steven Spielberg movies never do There are a few bloody attack moments but not all shark attacks show blood as well as some few intense jump scare moments that may be to intense for younger viewers  Overall its a great movie to watch,4
140106,1436번,Jaws,8,This is a GREAT classic film  This film In my opinion Is suitable for kids 11 and up  There is some blood and gore but otherwise it should be just fine as long as your kids dont get frightened too easily,3
140107,1436번,Jaws,8,Great horror movie about the hunt for a deadly great white shark,1
140108,1436번,Jaws,8,This an amazing movie and I really do think anyone who is mature,1
141158,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Jurassic Park is a movie about an island that is inhabited by dinosaurs that are kept in cages and enclosures  The dinosaurs were brought back by dna found in a bug that was encased in amber  The park gets visitors and during this tour the power gets cut and dinosaurs go rampant taking over the park and killing scientists and tourists  Alan is one of these tourists and he starts using his skillset to keep two children alive while they fight to get the dinosaurs back in containment,4
141159,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,I think this movie is great and that the dinosaurs are done really well  There is a lot of action and a few bloody scenes but nothing that bad,2
141160,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,This is a great movie It might be a little scary at points but that just adds to the suspense action and terror Some violent areas like a man getting eaten off a toilet and a severed arm on a womans shoulder  Overall a GREAT movie though Hope you enjoy,6
141161,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,jurassic park is a movie that has dinosaurs in a park that shows what they look like and how they act but they get fre and take over the island,1
141162,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Where do I even begin Its amazing  The plot is amazingly original the characters are very enjoyable and than theres the action  Where do I begin The Dinosaurs look AMAZING and the action is excellent creative and amazingly exciting  The acting is spectacular  I cant even put it into words how good the actors did  Flawless,8
141163,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Must see I bet you parents seen this but you are not sure for kids well easy there is chomping the main bad guy Denis died not at the end you think the TRex is bad but you relies the tRex is good and saves the day by eating 4 raptors and the best  classic WHEN DINOS ROARED THE  EARTH banner falls when the tRex roars  A car chase happens and just to say its a exiting scary story that will fill any body up with exiting action even if you hate dinosaurs as you they roared the earth once and not fully a dinosaur movie,2
141164,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Iv seen both Jurassic Park and JawsI personally think JAWS is a little bit better and like both of them  It is intense with some body parts falling off but fine for kids 10,2
141165,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,This movie is one of works of the legendary director Stephen Spielberg and special effects designer Stan Winston the made behind the Terminator Jaws Edward Scissorhands and many more  The movie was released to the world in 1993  Based on the novel by Michael Crichton published in 1990 this movie is a watch for the whole family  It was filmed in Kauai one of the Hawaiian Islands,4
141166,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,I loved this movie had violence but not so bad and langauge and drinking and smoking and a half naked girl in her bra and panties,1
141220,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,This is a very entertaining movie as well scary but not that scary  I really enjoyed this movie my 7 year old sister was a bit scared at some points but I think its fine  I personally think 9 is a,3
141221,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Jurassic Park is about a theme park full of dinosaurs  Before it can go public it needs to be proven safe by a lawyer a mathematician and 2 dinosaur experts  The grandkids of the parks creator also tag along for the ride  And as you might expect everything goes wrong,4
141222,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,I watched this movie when I was 7 and it was fine  If your trying to find a movie to watch with your family pick this Only part that may be frightening for young children is when the tRex eats the guy off a toilet LOL,3
141223,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,I think this movie should have been rated M or PG 13 cause some scenes may be a bit scary  Also towards the end it swung to close to the horror genre,2
141224,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Jurassic Park is a movie classic with peril and slim to none gory violence  The story is about archaeologists that get a opportunity to work at a dinosaur theme park but when a monsoon rolls into the island the dinosaurs in habitat escape  Lots of dinosaur jump scares but most kids and pre teens would be able to handle it  Characters use tranquilizer guns as well as machine guns  Dinks kill each other and humans through biting venom saliva spit and pouncing onto humans dinos  A character loses a arm and scares a main character which could be scary to younger kids  Kids get electrocuted and are in peril through the movie  Mild cursing such as son of a btch sht and damn  Overall great movie that older Kids and pre teens will love,9
141225,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,the is a brilliant movie but also good for younger kids because it could never happen in real life  highly reccomended as long as your kid is not too sensitive  there are positive adult role models  enjoy,4
141226,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Great movie but not for young children,1
141227,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,The Movie includes alot of scifi violence  There are scenes where dinosaurs kill people but it is not gory  Also some language Samuel L  Jackson so it is not for small ones  Great for 1015 year old,4
141228,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Parents need to know that this amazing film by Steven Spielberg is amazing  There is definitely lots of violence some of it quite gruesome involving a severed arm  Lots of terror as well and some language including a few ST and hells and damns and more  Positive role models and messages and helping them from dying of course and some product placements and of screen merchandising,4
141246,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,The classic Jurassic Park is a great movie with some fake animal violence,1
141247,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Jurassic park is a good movie with some blood children in constant peril and realistic dinosaurs  Overall fine for tweens,2
141248,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Astounding film filled with epic and memorable scenes  A great first PG13 film for kids,2
141249,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Jurassic Park is the ultimate combination of great acting terrific special effects and a script that really couldnt get any greater than it is  Since that script is about dinosaurs eating people it can be a very intense movie for some  I wouldnt call it scary as there isnt more than one true jumpscare but the rest of the intense scenes are played out very realistically with a real sense of grittiness and peril  The most brutal scene involves a man getting eaten whole by a T rex but as with all the other scenes theres not much blood  Language never goes too vulgar goddamn son of btch hell one big pile of sht etc  and even at that its few and far inbetween,6
141250,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,All the Jurassic Park movies are amazing but this one is by far the best  Older tweens and teens should be able to handle it  The dinosaurs are very realistic and might scare some younger kids but if they can handle scary things then they should be fine  Theres a lot of violence most if it isnt too bloody but it can still get a bit gruesome  The swearing is pretty mild for a PG13 movie at least compared to more recent PG13 movies it is  The swearing is mostly hell and damn with sht in there once or twice as well as religious profanity like oh my God etc  As long as kids know that dinosaurs arent real and scientists arent going to bring them back they should be fine,7
141251,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Whoever cab87670 is They are a liar,1
141252,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,This movie was the best but I dont think anyone under 14 should watch it it has some blood and gore lots of violence swearing and frightening scenes we also see a bloody animal leg land on a car  Its not your average dinosaur movie  But for 14 and up its awesome,3
141253,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,great classic spielberg film violence may disturb younger audiences and the swearing is a little much,1
141254,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,I watched it with my papaw and i thought it was really good One of my favorite movies overall  The parts i would look into was that When the goat was gone A bloody legarm of a goat landed on the car  The second part is when The girl goes to the shack to get the power to come back on she runs because the raptor chases her and mr arnolds arm slides out on her shoulder she walks forwards and its his arm that had been bit off and was very bloody  they say a few cuss words like 2 or three they say sh and bi,5
141265,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,This is a spectacular movie  The special effects of this movie are astounding and the dinosaurs are extremely realistic   the first thirty or forty minutes of this movie are mostly touring the park which some kids may find boring and want to stop the movie   But make sure they stick with it  because this movie turns into a fantastic thrill ride with suspense aplenty   In this classic thriller characters are almost always in danger   People are killed in this movie but most of the violence is not bloody in fact most of the deaths are not even fully shown   Only for or five people die in the entire movie   There are only two slightly violent scenes in which a goats leg is thrown on a window by a dinosaur and when a decapitated and rather fake looking arm is grabbed by a character which she drops almost immediately and is not shown again   Some blood is shown but it is mostly just scrapes and cuts on the people who survive   Language is scarce and I thought that this film was not scary at all but younger viewers may disagree   Overall I would say that this movie is a great family film and you only might want to preview it  for extremely young and sensitive children,11
141266,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Jurassic Park is a classic fun film for older kids  This film brings awe and wonder with its nice use of animatronic and CGI dinosaurs but with that brings terror and violet imagery  Even as  a mostly blood and goreless film expect character deaths from dinos big and small  While most deaths arent graphic or are done off screen there is one main exception with a scene involving a large dino that jumpscares you and a severed arm landing on another character  Even with the lack of extreme violence its still an intense movie involved peril and pursuit throughout   Sexual content is limited with the main one being a woman in a bikini on one of the staff members computers  Language is moderate with usual curses and 12 uses of the word st  Overall you really have to know your kid  Some kids may be fine with the violence but think its too scary  Others might not like some of the mildlyintense death scenes  I recommend you give it a viewing before letting your kid see it,10
141267,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,This is truly one of the greatest movies ever although the violence is high there a severed arm shown and some swearing to also people are eaten and a mans face is eaten off screen but you see the raptor on the guy getting eaten a man is eaten off of a toilet and a bloody leg is shown but overall its a must see movie,1
141268,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,This movie is definitely strong at some points and weak at others  I felt like in the first act of the movie was dull boring horribly written and not well acted but the second act was absolutely great It had amazing peril and just what i was looking for out of this movie but act three didnt get off that lucky because it gets worse by a bit but overall definitely a movie people should see,3
141269,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Really nothing to worry about  I watched it when I was six I was more fascinated then frightened  Parents Its good to let kids watch cool scifi violence and know a good movie to recommend and discuss with friends Its actually imaginationbuilding and not letting them watch movies can leave them very behind when theyre older Not appropriate for momsthough   My friends parents wouldnt let her watch Harry Potter when she was younger and now shes so set back on all the new action movies everyones talking about at school and very depressed about it,6
141270,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,The movie Jurassic Park is about an islandamusement park with  living dinosaurs  This movie is a classicactionscience fiction movie  The movie centers around two paleontologist that are asked to come see the park by its founder and creator  This movie is about dinosaurs that look very realistic this could be frightening for younger viewers  Characters swear  frequently throughout and one main character smokes throughout the movie  Overall this is a very exciting and well made film  I think it would be great for 13 and up depending on the maturity of the 13 year old,7
141271,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,Good film but definitely not for little children  I tried to show it to my 6 year old brother and he got bored at the start  Then I remembered the about the dinosaurs and turned it off   Not that scary but you need a good attention span to pay attention te some of the dialogue at the start   It is not a 12 or it would be a 12 on the box I watched this when I was 10 and that was a good age  Its a PG,5
141272,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,I watched this movie a year or two ago and I still love it to today  This movie is pretty fake but worth watching  The dinosaurs I have an exception for the incredibly realistic giants that are the main reason of this movie,3
141273,1469번,Jurassic Park,8,theres some swearing like sht crap hell  damn son of a bch   dodam  and some blood people shooting dinosaurs  and dinosaurs eating humans,1
141456,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,This game is the best just dance yet It has WAY more songs and more options  It has really nice songs and its a fun way to be exercised  Some parent reviews I just read said the songs with to much sex in it but everything about sex in songs is blurred  One parent said she wont even let her high school son play it but really thats just RIDICULOUS grow up parents They picked out some big pop hits and some classics  Really fun game for people to playso BUY IT,7
141457,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,censored swearing lyrics related to drinking sxual lyrics and themes and thats all,1
141458,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,This is a fun game for all ages to get moving  Best played with a camera to more accurately track movement  Characters can wear suggestive clothing and some lines can be slightly suggestive but it mostly goes over kids heads,3
141459,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,out of all of the just dance games Ive played this one is amazing  its taken a really big step from the previous game  some songs have some sexual references or alcohol references but its not that bad  Ive seen numerous comments saying this game is for people that are 18 and I dont get it  just dance is supposed to be for all ages and if its for all ages all the songs wouldnt be aimed towards only children because it wouldnt amuse the older people who want to play it  and as if the children are going to understand the explicit lyrics along with just dance censoring it  yes some songs meanings are straight up sex but its not like your kid is gonna go oh yea this song is about sex hell yeah lets go fuck a random person at a bar now  so cool or drugs like  omg this song is about drugs lemme go smoke some weed and do some heroin  honestly  they arent gonna understand what it means  and they gotta know someday  overall this game is amazing for all ages and gets everyone off their butt and start dancing  I love it radiates good energy and is great for a family night or a sleepover with your best friends,13
141460,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,When you are stuck in quarantine what is better than move around They have so much fun dances and they have cool songs like kiss you just dance I will survive ghostbusters and YMCA and LOTS of 196090 music These are really fun But it does have some native women with bras  Also some lyrics that say  gimme that yum like a Lollypop  if your kid wants it for a special event you do please make their wish come true ,4
141461,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,The game is pretty good World Dance Floor is a groundbreaking experience  to play with other Just Dancers all around the world  Sad the servers were shutdown for this game,2
141462,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,I think it is great for families and It contains a lot of copyrighted music,1
141463,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,If youre a bit overweight then this is the ultimate fix   This got me back in shape in the span of 1 summer   They have finally added a calorie counter that can be used for all songs and have put less 1D songs thank the Lord   The songs are great and my request was fulfilled more old songs please and Just a Gigolo is there   They have made the songs even more culturally diverse instead of just Indian songs Katti Kalandal and Beware of the Boys they have added Moskau   The songs require a lot of practice but improving is very rewarding   Its motivational to me that I can get coins and spend them on routines in any way or order that I want instead of the game deciding which song I get   This has gotten a bit more racy with the dancer in the Chris Brown song touching his chest and the Gentleman dancer pelvic thrusting and grabbing his crotch   Not for little kids booze and Illuminati was mentioned   I like the Roar song because its self empowering   Two thumbs up from me,11
141464,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,stupidly bad game,1
141465,1471번,Just Dance 2014,8,is really bad for kids  There are some songs that are VERY innapropriate,2
141602,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,I watched this with my aunt who is all about girl power and the strength of women  I was visiting her once and when we went to a movie store I found this movie and I have really wanted to see it It was her first time watching Miyazaki and thought it was wonderful  Kiki goes off on her own to live as a young witch and work to help the new community she lives in  Even though it was hard she works hard and tries to do the right thing to benefit everyone  This is probably the best Miyazaki for girls,5
141603,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,everyone can what it  not scary except at the end for little ones no sexy stuff no swearing other than a few insults  great movie  no drinking drugs or smoking,4
141604,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,i thought it was really cool to watch especially if your in the UK and cant get your hands on this DVD   anyway if you like cartoons and a bit of flying magic you will definitely enjoy this its one of my favourite DVDs please watch it,2
141605,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,This is an awesome movie for all ages  It is a very entertaining movie to watch with a good story about a young witch trying to discover who she is  There is no violence or swearing there are some suspenseful moments when Kiki is on her broom stick but nothing scary that will keep kids up at night  It has many good lessons about helping others and being yourself also many good role models  It is still fun to watch for older kids so if your family has older kids and younger kids this is an awesome movie to watch,5
141606,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,Well I couldnt have predicted this After the unabashed feebleness of My Neighbor Totoro I cant say that I was too hyped to watch Kikis Delivery Service  But out of the clear blue sky Ive found a Miyazaki movie that I like even more than Princess Mononoke It shocked me as well  Kikis Delivery Service doesnt share Princess Mononokes grander or epic story telling  But then again it doesnt collapse around itself in the third act Mononokes main problem  The final product is so very whimsical I couldnt help but grin the entire way through,7
141607,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,awesome educational movie,1
141608,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,I was actually hesitant to watch this movie but it did not disappoint  It was very fun and beautifully done  I love how Studio Ghibli always makes it feel like youre in that time  One of my favorite scenes was when Kiki and Tombo ride the bike together very cute  Good scenery animation as usual,5
141609,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,People always say That if I Was Any Movie Character Id Be Kiki  This Movie Is The 4th Miyazaki Film I Have Ever Seen Out of 9 and It So Edge of Your Seat and The Animation is Breathtaking I Think Kikis Delivery Service is One of The Top 30 Best Movies Ever Made,2
141610,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,My family and I loved this movie Kikis so sweet and the same goes for Osono and Jiji This has to be one of my favorite studio ghibli movies,3
141611,1491번,Kiki's Delivery Service,8,I love this movie,1
141631,1492번,Kim Possible,6,This movie is full of characters who are suposed to represent girl power  Instead it just holds a girl who runs around with  bunch of gadgets and unrealisticly can outkick and outpunch mean henchmen    a rather skinny girl just starting high schoolas she flips around with a bunch of acrobatic and in the air flips and spins  Not a girl model I would like children to see  My younger siblings even started doing karate type moves after watching it  Not safe for themselves and they may hurt each other   It isnt too different from any modern superhero movie except that it is more cheesy   If you want your girl to get the impresion that she has to act like a tomboy or shes not worth anything than go ahead and watch  Plus the fact that most of the female characters are wearing skin tight clothes,10
141632,1492번,Kim Possible,6,They have to fight Fight a virus Virus,2
141633,1492번,Kim Possible,6,The Kim Possible movie is surprisingly good  Lots of people thinks this movie sucks and while it doesnt top the original I still had a fun time with this movie  It was fun to see these beloved characters and places adapted into live action  And while then clothes arent the best I hardly have a problem with it  Sure this movie has some bad spots but all movies do even great ones  However this movie isnt as kidfriendly as the show,6
141634,1492번,Kim Possible,6,To start off the actor who played Ron Stoppable made my ears bleed  He was such an annoying character who made you cringe more than laugh  He didnt have any likeable traits and wasnt anything like the original Ron Stoppable  The jokes in this movie werent funny and the puns made it worse  They often tried to make it feel more relatable to kids but it came across as trying too hard  The main character Kim didnt do the original character justice  She was very whiny and didnt send a good message about supporting your friends  I had an idea of what I was getting into when I decided to watch this movie but it was still disappointing with how they botched such a funny and creative show,8
141635,1492번,Kim Possible,6,They dont really explain the backstory of Kim but the music is catchy seeing Athenas head in a pile of rubble is freaky espescially since she talking then and the movie overall isnt that interesting and Athena goes from good to bad to good again which is weird but the moral of not being jealous and strong females is ensuring that the writers had good intentions,1
141636,1492번,Kim Possible,6,I think that Kim Possible is appropriate for kids 9 and up because it presents the importance of friendship and teamwork while incorporating kid friendly humor  It teaches kids how to grapple with jealousy and other simple day to day struggles that we kids might not know how to approach,2
141637,1492번,Kim Possible,6,I loved the Kim Possible show but the Movie is just another one of those Disney LiveAction films that ruin the original  Id rather do my homework than watch this,2
141638,1492번,Kim Possible,6,I really like it,1
141639,1492번,Kim Possible,6,Based on what i read is that Kim possible is the best movie and kim possible help people that are in danger that why i like the movie,1
141640,1492번,Kim Possible,6,This movie is amazing It was made last year 2019 it was the best movie ever also kind sad tough but most of it I liked,3
141917,1508번,Knives Out,8,Great movie love the mystery and comedy  This movie is one of my favorites but it has a little too much language that didnt need to be in the movie,2
141918,1508번,Knives Out,8,Very entertaining with a great cast and plot  Its a bit slow at times but the plot twists and ending make up for it,2
141919,1508번,Knives Out,8,Context when I walk into a movie theater I automatically have a negative opinion on the movie  This had gotten to the point where I wasnt sure if this was a good strategy as there was always SOMETHING that made me dislike a movie   And then    there was Knives Out,3
141920,1508번,Knives Out,8,This movie is a murder mystery film it has violence and some cussing  However the characters are wellrounded and clever this is a very good murder mystery movie that is a must watch if you like comedy and thrillers,2
141921,1508번,Knives Out,8,I personally love this movie  I think most kids in 6th grade and up should see it  The cast is phenomenal  Its not surprising but the story line is,4
141922,1508번,Knives Out,8,I LOVED the movie my parents and I saw a ad and we just had to watch it I wasnt very surprised when they said who it was  Your welcome for not spoiling but I think everyone knew who ACTUALLY killed him kind of obvious,1
141923,1508번,Knives Out,8,Plot Google it yourself ,1
141924,1508번,Knives Out,8,cool movie an excellent mystery followed by excellent acting Daniel Craig and Chris Evans A fascinating funny mystery Its cool and epic and for sure a must watch,1
141925,1508번,Knives Out,8,This movie is great fun and great everyone over 11,1
141926,1508번,Knives Out,8,This movie is sooo goood Its so funny but you always are wondering what happened and how did the detective know But parents need to know that there is an affair medicationdrugs a tiny bit of violence and scariness smoking drinking a tiny bit of bloodetc  this movie is good but for kids who can handle that and kids who can handle that only For ages 14 shouldnt have to be mature,5
142034,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,I loved this movie  One of the best of the year  The animation of course is gorgeous and flawless the voice acting is great the action sequences were exciting and surprisingly brutal the score is beautiful and the storytelling is amazing with the main character telling stories with origami  The 3D is unnecessary  Grade A,5
142035,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,Impeccable and majestic beauty Laika is already a strengthened production studio of distinguished films that combine traditional animation with a reserved use of digital technology obtaining an air more craft and realistic technique present in feature films such as the gloomy Coraline or the terrifying ParaNorman Laika has established a great fortitude and prestige in a world in where Pixar prevails year after year Kubo and The Two Strings consolidates the essence of prior all films of the studio while adding something extra courtesy of a timeless visual and narrative magnificence an eloquent feat of 2016 and openly a direct nominated to The Academy Awards,1
142036,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,Kubo is one of the best films I have seen in a long time and I have no doubt it will be nominated for an Oscar much less win  The visuals are absolutely stunning a mix of stopmotion and animation that creates a visual masterpiece  The story and plot are complex and is told in quite a beautiful way  That being said it is a very dark tale right from the beginning with many deaths one very unexpected and sad one many many scenes of peril and VERY intense violence with blood and injuries  Many scenes have very creepy ambiance and tone  The language is pretty tame although there is one use of the word hell in reference to how humans live compared to how another character does  I would say this is for about kids 10 who can handle it  My sensitive 10 yearold brother had nightmares but there were other other younger children who did just fine  However dont let that shy you away from this stunning film as it is also pretty funny and sweet and has a great message about family and love  For more mature audience this is an absolute mustsee,10
142037,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,This is now my favourite movie,1
142038,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,This was a great fantastical movie  Its about a young boy named Kubo who has a mysterious power to make paper shape into little creatures when he plays his shamisen guitarlike instrument ,2
142039,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,In a year of talking animated animal movies Kubo may be far one of the best next to Zootopia  While Kubo isnt exactly a talking animal film Other than a beetle and a monkey this strange stop motion piece of art is really neat and beautifully done,2
142040,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,It is great and I loved it  Something Ive never seen before but doesnt stray too far away from normal  Good lure and original story,3
142041,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,I have to say that the visual affects on this movie is spectacular and good  But on the down side this movie could have been better and not so forced pushed in the end their were some parts that were spiritual in a way also  and also there is a lot of violence for a PG movie  ,4
142042,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,It was cute but the childish characters and the boring slow pace ruined it for me  Also it does get a bit too disturbing but not too depressing,2
142043,1514번,Kubo and the Two Strings,6,Scary,1
142044,1516번,"Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter",8,This is not some nice snowy film with an adventure  Its some depressing story you dont want to watch and doesnt make you feel inspired either,2
142045,1516번,"Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter",8,So if you are hoping for an uplifting snowy adventure NO this is NOT what you are looking for at all  It is so depressing it is too long uneventful  So half of the movie she has done nothing except be in her town she is a mentally ill lady who goes into the wilderness to find treasure from Fargo the movie lets down kindness twice throws her rabbit on a train spitting into her boss tea stole his credit card A TERRIBLE MOVIE  and then,3
142046,1516번,"Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter",8,My ratingPG for mature scenes,1
142074,1518번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,Before I say what Im about to say this movie is awesome  The music is great humor is great character development its just great There isnt any concerning violence and other content stays within the PG range  Now that Ive said all of that Im going to say what caused me problems when I first watched this  Part of the plot has to do with Pos past and what happened to his mother and all of that made me cry  But not during the movie but several weeks after  I would literally cry myself to sleep with my mom at my bedside to try to sooth me  In other words be aware of your childs sensitivity when considering this movie  Im okay now and I think the movie is great,9
142075,1518번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,This movie has a little bit more violence and the message is mildly worse  but the movie is my favorite of the 3,2
142076,1518번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,Awesome  I think kids aged 6 and up will love this movie,3
142077,1518번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,I saw this in theaters years agoand I wil sayits awesome  Just like the 1st movieit has a good messageand has great humor  Really worth watching overall,3
142078,1518번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,Out of all the Kung Fu Panda movies this one is without a doubt my favorite and it has always been that way,1
142079,1518번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,I loved Kung fu panda   so why not watch the second one it was a really good sequel   it is a little  Violence    but who cares it was AMAZING it gets you into the Kung fun spirt   so grab a pillow watch the series,1
142080,1518번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,This movie has a deep message that all people should remember no matter what your past is you can choose who you are now  The animation is done very well  Very funny and a beautifully written script  It is centered around Po the panda trying to discover his past so he can find peace  It is inspiring when he finds peace even when he knows Shen was responsible for the killing of his parents  Its a must watch for families  However if your child is adopted you should consider sitting with them while the movie plays because it shows Pos parents abandoning him and this may negatively affect your adopted child,7
142081,1518번,Kung Fu Panda 2,8,A bird uses lots of gunpower,1
142320,1523번,La La Land,8,good movie acting was amazing   I just thought muscials were supposed to be haaaapppppyyyyy  Other than that it was an amazing musical  Emma Stone was AMAZING and she has a lovely voice,3
142321,1523번,La La Land,8,This is a great story about never giving up on your dreams and a love story between two people  I would not let your child watch this movie if they are unaware of what the middle finger means  Overall a wholesome movie with a truely amazing soundtrack that made me love jazz music,3
142322,1523번,La La Land,8,Romantic musical with awesome actors and awesome music,1
142323,1523번,La La Land,8,This movie is gorgeous The colors the songs the music the dances and the actors are all so amazing Its hard to explain it with words The story is about two people Sebastian and Mia who are trying to pursue their dreams  Mia wants to be an actress and Sebastian wants to have his own jazz club  After they keep running into each other they decide to pursue their love affair  Will they be able to fall in love and pursue their dreams or not Watch this movie to find out,9
142324,1523번,La La Land,8,I LOVED this movie and I dont usually do musicals  It was very clean with the exception of some language  but it was not too excessive   I wouldnt recommend it for kids because it is just a very mature movie and the ending would be hard for a kid to understandit made me cry  But the story was great it had amazing music and is definitely a perfect movie if youre looking for a romancemusical,4
142325,1523번,La La Land,8,I am in love this movie  I love everything from the songs to the actors to the choreography  I watched this movie with my 8yearold sister and we loved it It is worth the money trust me you will love it  Its not a cheesy romance movie but it is about chasing your dreams,5
142326,1523번,La La Land,8,I saw this when it first came out in theaters and my first thoughts were Ok this isnt to bad about 20 minutes in I realized that it was probably the worst movie Ive ever scene   The plot is terrible and unless you like watching actors act like there professional dancers when they probably have never taken a class in there life youll hate it   About half way through I began to regret some life choices like wasting 2 hours of my life on a movie that doesnt even have a good plot   Once it was over Id decided that I would rather be at the dentist than watching this movie   Its fine for kids ages 7 and up but its not good so just dont bother,5
142327,1523번,La La Land,8,This movie was suburb with great messages  about love and creativity but strong language like F   K and s   T this movie is perfect for kids 9 and up,1
142607,1550번,Leap!,6,This movie had such a rich and powerful message it brought me to tears by the ending credits  It was by far the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life  The music really contributed to the overall feel of the movie  I definitely recommend this movie,4
142608,1550번,Leap!,6,So Im 13 and I personally loved this movie  My 7yr old sister came in my room and turned on this movie  I was doing homework but ended up sitting down and watching it with her  I actually think I enjoyed it more that my sister  There is a bar scene but there is no blatant drunkenness the main plot of the scene is to show  Felici dancing  The movie emphasizes hard work and the importance of forgiving others  I give this a 10 out of 10 a must see,7
142609,1550번,Leap!,6,I saw this movie with a bunch of other teenage girls  We predicted every plot twist and laughed at the cheesy dialogue but thats what made it good  It is definitely unrealistic and silly from many aspects but you have to accept that and enjoy it for what it is  One of the last scenes was a bit scary for little kids  Camilles mother is chasing Felicie with a giant hammer  It would be scary for a young child but other than that it is a pretty safe movie  The messages are good  The protagonist makes mistakes must own up to them and over comes them  Overall this was a good movie,9
142610,1550번,Leap!,6,Makes me want to jump off the roof  Great familyfriendly adventure for 6 years olds  Some scary parts though  LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPP Role models are GREAT,5
142611,1550번,Leap!,6,Great movie for everyone,1
142612,1550번,Leap!,6,I watched this movie in the theatre and I loved it It is a lovely film that mostly follows Felicie on her journey to become a Ballerina  Although the movie glosses over some of the time it took for her to become a ballerina we dont actually know how long it skipped as she practiced all we got was a rehearsal and practice montage and I thought it worked really well I would be able to watch it so many more times and not get tired of it  Also with the homocidal mom my mom told me that in Japan it is so competitive to get your kids into a good preschool that some moms have actually killed other kids  So in a way the movie mom kind of makes sense because she believes Camilles future is ruined  Great Movie,7
142613,1550번,Leap!,6,I first saw this movie on a plane It was called Ballerina  I liked it so much I saw it 3 more times It inspired me to join Ballet classes and Im really enjoying them  The movie  has great messages and role models  It has very little violence and nothing inappropriate for kids It is definitely a very good family movie,7
142614,1550번,Leap!,6,I would say that its good for anyone   But the boy is more of a backup character   And if there are people who mostly want movies about boy inventors then I wouldnt suggest this,3
142615,1550번,Leap!,6,Good for boys and girls  I liked it,1
142789,1564번,LEGO DUPLO WORLD,7,This game or app is only for ages 2 to 4,1
142871,1576번,Lemonade Mouth,8,This movie is all about how a band comes together and becomes famous all from getting into detention dont go to detention kids even though you could end up being famous like these guys but that is highly unlikely sorry to burst your bubble anyway the songs are so good and its a BOP  There is nothing bad but it does include language they speak english but I bet theres versions in different languages tooo,2
142872,1576번,Lemonade Mouth,8,Probably the best Disney Channel movie ever,1
142873,1576번,Lemonade Mouth,8,it has everything singing  craziness silliness and makes you happy,1
142874,1576번,Lemonade Mouth,8,I would say this movie wasnt amazing but its better than any other Disney Channel movie  A lot of the other movies often star a cheerful but annoying tween who has practically no social skills plus almost any main guy character in those movies is almost purely a love interest,2
142875,1576번,Lemonade Mouth,8,I absolutely ADORE this movie and I am almost 15 years old  Its AMAZING and filled with great messages great music and great role models  There is a little bit of romance although I wouldnt exactly call it that  I have no other word  One of the main characters has a boyfriend and she kisses his cheek but there is no lip on lip kissing  She later finds her boyfriend with another girl whos wearing his jacket and touching his bicep  Another main character tells a girl that he likes her but its no big deal,7
142876,1576번,Lemonade Mouth,8,What can I say This movie when I watched it seemed perfect  Despite being GPG rated different sources say different ratings they didnt hold back from adding emotional and tougher scenes which now that Im older I enjoy more and more  As much as I loved it now I dont know if I would have loved it as much if I were younger  I recommend it for kids eleven and up although its great for a movie night with the entire family ,5
142877,1576번,Lemonade Mouth,8,This movie in my opinion is really cheesy and is not worth watching  I mean in one scene out of the clear blue sky everyone starts playing  a song when they just meet as if they have been practicing for YEARS  And in another before theyre first performance a main character Olivia is feeling nervous and then as if it will make the world perfect one of her band mates passes her some lemonade and then POOF Everyone can move on with their wonderful lives  Some of the music was kind of good but in my opinion not good enough to make up for the unrealistic story line,5
142878,1576번,Lemonade Mouth,8,Really good,1
142879,1576번,Lemonade Mouth,8,It is a really good movie with lots of cool songs  I havent seen it in a few years but I still remember Determinate  Also it has a lot of good messages such as defend your friends from bullies and stand up for what you believe in,3
143428,1597번,Lightyear,7,This Is a very nice movie  Love the teamwork and the action  It is a little funny but it is a family movie,3
143429,1597번,Lightyear,7,This is a fun space movie  I have a couple qualms about it however  The movies intro notes that the movie in from 1995 but ironically its the best animated Pixar film to date in my mind  Secondarily and this is not the movies fault people have been interpreting the scene where there is a samesex kiss as a heavily sexualized scene but this is not true  The characters kiss for 0 2 seconds and its edited out in the Disney version  Additionally people seem to not care whether or not straight couples kiss in movies so I dont see the big deal  The movie has a great cast of voices featuring Chris Evans as Buzz doing an OK job replacing Tim Allen James Brolin as a redesign of Zurg Buzzs enemy from Toy Story 2 Keke Palmer as Izzy Hawthorne the grandchild of Buzzs friend Alisha and Taika Watiti as Mo Morisson a hapless space recruit  In terms of violence the movie is okay in the opening scenes there are vine aliens which spray green blood when attacked with a lightsaberesque weapon  Zurgs robots are semiviolent  There are carnivore bugs which attempt to eat Buzz in one scene  Several aliens are electrified on a laser shield but this is not really violent and mainly used for comedic relief  Zurg has a dangerous mech suit which shoots lasers at Buzz and grabs him with a large grappling hook  Zurg also has an evil version of Buzzs robot Sox which appears to be melty and is kind of gross  Zurgs backstory is kind of sad as he SPOILERS is an old version of Buzz who was abused by the various military commanders and went on too many time travel missions causing his friends to pass away and give him the idea he forced them away  A character is often captured by the previously mentioned sentient vines but is shown to escape another is presumably killed by the vines  There are some strange scenes involving scientific depictions of time travel which may confuse younger kids  Explosions are shown but often in a stereotypical manner  Buzz is slightly abused by a military commander who seeks to exploit his skills  Buzz steals a ship from a space headquarters to save the planet but this may be interpreted as flatout criminal activity by your children  Its a pretty okay movie for kids 8 and up and it comes with a cute robot cat so who couldnt resist,20
143430,1597번,Lightyear,7,They worked too hard on the animation and not hard enough on the story  For most of the movie he just tries and fails to get back to his home planet  And then he gives up in the end  The End  Blah  The animation is pretty good though But other than that blah,7
143431,1597번,Lightyear,7,The whole movie had an objective and they didnt even achieve that objective  Started out strong but got weaker and weaker,2
143432,1597번,Lightyear,7,This is an amazing movie  I found it funny and actionpacked  Sox carried the whole movie  The only reason people said it was inappropriate is because there was a 0 2 second same sex kiss That was cut on Disney,4
143433,1597번,Lightyear,7,I is so good buzz lightyear has a amazing adventure throw space it is a family film and you can learn a lot about space from this film which is why I rated this film 5 stars,1
143434,1597번,Lightyear,7,Dont know what the fuss is all about  Great film my 8yearold was a bit confused with the plot thats why I put 9 and older,2
143470,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,If you enjoy 00s Disney films this is a great pick for you  Has many nostalgic elements from many childhoods  I recommend this for ages 6 and up because some scenes can be frightening for younger viewers  Great film,4
143471,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,So Im a teen mom with a 2 year old running around my house I watched this movie when I was a kid and I personally think its a good movie for kids around 5 maybe even younger with their parents around  It is important that they know its not ok to talk to strangers and its not ok to fight but this movie is something for the kids and parents to sit and watch WITH THEM  My little girl can learn values from the movie like family strength,3
143472,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,I changed my mind  I really love Lilo  Stitch because theyre so cool But theyre sister Hona is rude and bossy  But shes okay  The Music is Amazing The Opening was Fantastic The Animation is Awesome And The Characters are very funny I saw this movie when I was a little kid  And I liked it  I laughed at the funny parts of this hilarious and action packed movie This movie is very funny for kids 5 and up,9
143473,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,I have this movie on DVD and think its really touching it teaches kids that sometimes in life things might not always go the way you planned them  it also teaches to respect people for who they are even if there an alien  I also love the connection between stitch and lilo in this movie  the bit were stitch leaves because he feels like he doesnt feel right in lilos world made me cry  really good movie,5
143474,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,Some rude words like stupidhead and butt but I think its good for 6 and up  Some violence but I thought it was great 4 and a half stars,3
143475,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,Most of the reviews here seem to swing dramatically one way or the other  Taken for what it is its a great movie  Its funny sweet a bit of a tearjerker and I just love the round comfortablelooking character design Pretty much every character is likable too even the antagonistic ones are trying to do the right thing,4
143476,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,i love ohana means family and family means no one gets left behind or forgotten and its such a cute movie,1
143477,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,Its good for kids like me yes,1
143478,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,This movie has cute characters many positive role models and laughs,1
143479,1602번,Lilo and Stitch,8,I think it is a good  comedy for kids 6  Sometimes they yell    There  also a war scene  with shooting cannons and guns  You  should watch this film right now,5
144198,1638번,Lost and Found,4,Im not exaggerating this movie is GORGEOUS  But it might scare or depress little kids  Ex  the graphic and very realistic storm at sea giant octopus rises from the water and turns out to be a freind My sister was scared of the octopus  And tears exploded from her eyes in an emotonal storm when the boy was looking for the penguin  GREAT movie would watch any time  3 stars left out two for the sadness scariness,8
144199,1638번,Lost and Found,4,Nothing is scary in this movie  There were really adorable characters that treat each other sweetly  I love that penguin The octopus looked scary for 1 minute but they were sleeping on the bottom of the boat and the octopus helped them because he was great,4
144212,1646번,Love & Mercy,8,If your ideal movie is a terrible story that has no plot action or conflict I would recommend this one to you for sure  There is nothing bad in the movie a toddler could watch it  The movie is just not good  Its boring as hell,4
144213,1646번,Love & Mercy,8,I love the Beach Boys but not Mike Love  And this biopic kinda missed the mark for me  The 60s scenes were so enjoyable the 90s not so much  If it had been only the 60s I probably wouldve liked it more although I understand the importance of Brian Wilsons life in the 90s  So this is worth a watch  For half of it at least,6
144214,1646번,Love & Mercy,8,This film is absolutely amazing and very different  This movie contains some language especially in one scene and a lot of pot use  There are also some very intense scenes when Brian is having panic attacks and hallucinating  But I highly recommend this film,4
144215,1646번,Love & Mercy,8,My ratingPG13 for racy referencessome languageand drug use throughout,1
144526,1660번,Luca,5,This film has some scary moments but kids will still enjoy and is a positive movie,1
144527,1660번,Luca,5,I am 11 years old watched it with my father and my 6 year old brother,1
144528,1660번,Luca,5,yes,1
144529,1660번,Luca,5,Educational a lot of positive messages such as dont be overprotective parent looks doesnt matter  what you do does teams can do everything follow your dreams,1
144530,1660번,Luca,5,It was a pretty good movie  I had low expectations so I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was better than I thought it was going to be  It has really good meaning and the music is excellent,3
144531,1660번,Luca,5,I watched this with my mom and sister it was good I liked the part when Lucas uncle comes over its really funny Some of the fishing supplies Knives hooks spears and nets were a little creepy because they were all around the town  I enjoyed this movie I hope you do too,4
144532,1660번,Luca,5,i actualy liked this movie  theres nothing wrong with it,2
144533,1660번,Luca,5,A funny movie that gets everybody in the family belly laughing Luca is a brilliant Pixar feature  I would recommend it to any family who enjoy films like Inside Out Zootopia or really any of Pixars amazing movies  But although all the family will deeply enjoy it and want to watch it again and again only 9 will really appreciate the emotional ending,3
144534,1660번,Luca,5,This is a really fun and wholehearted movie that kids will love Its about a young boy who is a sea monster ventures out into a small Italian town to make a new adventures,2
144535,1660번,Luca,5,i still love it maybe a little intense with the fighting and everything but it is still great,2
144958,1687번,Maleficent,8,Maleficent was truly magnificent though I wouldnt recomend it for 7 and under because the scenes are a bit dark and have a little violence  Other then that it was good  The only things that I think relate to sleeping beauty are the set up and cast but Maleficent is a movie in itself  Angelina Jollie and Elle Fanning did a great job as Maleficent and Princess Aurora  My absolute favorite character had to be Maleficent for her brilliant acting  I think it is a good family movie and if I had the chance to I would definitely go see it again,6
144959,1687번,Maleficent,8,When Maleficent was fighting it was a bit too violent but there is a good message later on in the film,1
144960,1687번,Maleficent,8,It was just a dark retelling of Sleeping Beauty  Nothing extraordinary but still good,2
144961,1687번,Maleficent,8,Maleficent is a great movie based on the original fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty but from the villains point of view  The movie does have some violence and some scary scenes which could be disturbing for some children  However Maleficent is a very creative version of Sleeping Beauty that shows a totally different side of the story,3
144962,1687번,Maleficent,8,I saw this movie with my family and it was better than I was expecting  Such a great movie with heartwarming scenes  Although some of the scenes SPOILER ALERT were a bit intense for some kids in my opinion like when Maleficent wakes up and realizes her wings have been cut off and cries out in distress and when Maleficent is trapped in a net which is hurting her  But these scenes are not too intense from my perspective  Another thing is when ANOTHER SPOILER rescues a crow he turns him into a naked man But NOTHING below the waist is shown so it is not that innaproprate  at all and nothing sexual is seen or done  This movie is pretty good and has great messages like not letting anger make you a horrible person and that some men are not as nice as they seem,6
144963,1687번,Maleficent,8,Im ten and I LOVED this movie it is beautiful and surprising not like any other movie Ive ever seen   Very intense and includes a VERY powerful message   I would recommend 910 year olds for good reasons Maleficents anger is overpowers her and can scare younger kids as can the battle scenes but the battle scenes are not as scary as some of the reviews have said  This movie is not quite as scary as some of the reviews have said including the one that says there are decapitated people and a bloody stump which by the way you have to look SUPER close to see any of that,5
144964,1687번,Maleficent,8,Okay the violence is the only thing thats not for younger kids  This movie was very good and the graphics special CGI effects were just awesome  Okay for 10,3
144965,1687번,Maleficent,8,I saw this delightful movie with some friends for a birthday party and we were overwhelmed by how extraordinary this film was  It was about love but not romantic  It was funny at times but a little scary for younger kids  It was a bit violent at times but we went with my friends 7 year old sister and she loved it I was worried when she began crying but she said it was because she was happy that Maleficent didnt die  In the scary scenes she wanted to hide her eyes behind my purse but it was ok  over all it was completely amazing  Maleficent was the best movie Ive seen in years I love this film so much that I am going to watch it again,8
144966,1687번,Maleficent,8,The movie has a good message is funny somewhat saddening exciting and beautiful at the same time  Angelina Jolie was amazing at her part  Great twist on a classic tale,3
144967,1687번,Maleficent,8,Great movie The only bad part about it is when Maleficent gets her wings cut offno blood though just sad  The movie is worth going too  My eleven year old sister and I really enjoyed it,4
145198,1695번,Manny,8,My rating PG13 intense sequences of violence and language,1
145261,1703번,Mario Kart Wii,8,Its a great example and an iconic landmark for gaming  Its a very social family friendly game  Its very fun and can be played for hours as every race is different,3
145262,1703번,Mario Kart Wii,8,This game is so fun Its for all ages and anyone even those who never played any of the Mario Bros  games,2
145263,1703번,Mario Kart Wii,8,i played this game at age 3 the graphic had  bit pixel but good the game had weapons like bombs blue bombs and shells like red shells green shells i still have a copy  of the game im gonna keep the game and copy has a Mario game its not like the 1983 Mario game its Karting game that has some violence but no blood,1
145264,1703번,Mario Kart Wii,8,Mario kart wii is honestly my favorite mk game solely for how many available modifications there are  A few are scams but the real ones like CTGPR make the game really fun and the best Mario kart,2
145265,1703번,Mario Kart Wii,8,I think Mariokart Wii is a fun game and when I first played it with my cousin we had lots of fun playing it and we could not stop  I enjoy playing it today and it is one of my favorite games to play,2
145266,1703번,Mario Kart Wii,8,Mario Kart has a lot of great games but this is one of the best,1
145267,1703번,Mario Kart Wii,8,The first thing to note is that the game is amazing  I recieved the game when I was five along with the Nintendo Wii   The game is fun for the whole family multiplayer is a must play  The only thing to note is that the game can be frustrating for younger kids at first as the controls can be a bit finnicky  In addition its recommended to start out on Automatic Mode versus Manual Mode  This allows you to turn easily without the unnecessary buttons involved  However this comes at a price  It is significantly harder to win on Automatic Mode  And that can be frustrating  However with time Manual mode can seem easy,10
145268,1703번,Mario Kart Wii,8,Its good for the whole family  a fun fast easy to learn racing game with Mario and freinds A bit of cartoon violence but still worth playing if over 6,3
145269,1703번,Mario Kart Wii,8,Fine for kids  Just racing  You can sometimes throw weapons at other characters  No blood  All animated,5
145434,1707번,Mars Attacks!,8,Great cast but strange thing to watch,1
145435,1707번,Mars Attacks!,8,there is a lot of violence characters are set on fire blown up aliens head explodes with green blood but it is all done digitally and very easy to tell its fake5,1
145436,1707번,Mars Attacks!,8,Some really strong violence in this film Characters are burned by lazar guns to the bone a talking human head is scene of the body with blood the president is stabbed through the back Aliens heads splatter with green goo  Some language to like St AssAhole Prick and Crap  Some sexual stuff to like scantily clad women and rumbling camper van which implies there having rough sex  Also some scenes at a casino Social drinking and cigar puffing,4
145437,1707번,Mars Attacks!,8,Trash,1
145438,1707번,Mars Attacks!,8,This is a good movie with some intense scary moments and funny moments  I think kids under 8 will be hurt cause of these scenes,2
145439,1707번,Mars Attacks!,8,This film is funny as hell  The Martians killing everyone may be abnoxious but Funny at the same time  Features an all star cast starring Batmans Jack Nicholson as President James Dale and also plays some person in Vegas  Other cast members include Glenn Cosse and Back To The Futures Micheal J Fox  And of course Tom Jones appears  Sadly it Bombed at the Box Office,6
145440,1707번,Mars Attacks!,8,This is the movie that scifi horror comedy and Tim Burton classic that are all bunched together to make an action packed film that anyone will love  The movie has a COUPLE swear words in it   Also the martians and what they do may as well be kinda creepy this is a great alien movie that anyone would love,3
145441,1707번,Mars Attacks!,8,I watched it when I was 14   I understand why my parents wouldnt let me watch it before that   It is because of the scene where the President gets stabbed   That bit is a bit gruesome and may have freaked me out when I was about 10   I loved the whole movie and has replaced Dispicable Me as my all time favourite movie,5
145442,1707번,Mars Attacks!,8,Occasional cigarettes are seen  2 characters flirt on a TV show very infrequent moderate sex  Horror is too scary for under 8s  Frequent moderate violence and bloodshed e g  A alien in disguise bites someones fingers off and heads explode  At different times in the movie  A peaceful woman refers to being an alcoholic and stopping her addiction  A crucial seen is a casino in Vegas and a husband tells his wife to  play for there anversary   A man refers to aliens as S word heads  Consumerism wise again gambling occurs and the majority of people are rich  However the film is about teamwork to find a plane this is at the end and a woman is purely trying to make peace in her life,10
145527,1718번,Mary Poppins,5,The worlds coolest nanny celebrates family and fun,1
145528,1718번,Mary Poppins,5,Great classic childrens movie  I had to write a film analysis essay for this movie there are lots of things to praise  Catchy songs and nice character development,3
145529,1718번,Mary Poppins,5,Mary Poppins is an instant classic I first watched this movie in March 2020 with my mom when I was sick  I loved it It took me a few tries for me to understand the plot and stuff  I even have the 50th anniversary DVD of Mary Poppins Its just as good as the sequel that came out 54 years later But I like the first movie better  Mr  Banks can be a little stern Mrs  Banks sings a song about the right for women to vote Sister Suffragette Ellen and Mrs  Brill are supporting characters  Bert is a peppy chimney sweep and the 1960s version of Jack The Lamplighter from Mary Poppins Returns  Mary Poppins is everyones favorite flying and singing British nanny thats always prim and proper and is practically perfect in every way  Anyway if you like fantasies from the 60s Id recommend this one for sure,10
145530,1718번,Mary Poppins,5,when I was younger I would constantly watch this amazing movie it wonderful even though I do not watch this movie on a regular basis anymore whenever I hear someone talking about it it still brings a smile to my face every time  its definitely a must watch,3
145531,1718번,Mary Poppins,5,I saw it for the first time when I was 5 years old it enchanted me right away,1
145532,1718번,Mary Poppins,5,Mary Poppins is a great Disney classic  Many people dub it as Disneys crowning achievement or Disneys ultimate classic and its not hard to see why  Ever since its release in 1964 it has enchanted generations of people  Adding to that this film may be one of the more memorable movies of all time  Fun fact I had only seen this movie once or twice beforehand about 5 or 6 years ago and so many songs and so much of the story stuck with me,5
145671,1728번,Max,8,Max delivers a great message to all viewers  Really hits you in the feel in some scenes,2
145672,1728번,Max,8,This was a really good movie Max was a great touching story There were some sad and violent parts that will make you cry but there are a lot of happy parts too some of those parts make you cry happy tears  If you do not like to cry dont watch this movie if you diced not to for that reason or any other reasons you will regret i  The adventure that this movie takes you on is truly amazing It is also a bit racist and definitly for older kids,7
145673,1728번,Max,8,I am not giving 5 stars because it is sad  It has mild violence action and peril just one kiss and language like friggin one sht damn and hell  Just one part a man offers someone a beer  My rating PG mild violence action peril some language and sexuality and brief language,4
145674,1728번,Max,8,For a PG movie it was pretty violent  But lets talk about the movie  I loved it  Me and my mom really dont see that many movies together because I mean we like Bourne thrillers but this movie was great  I didnt think it was bad at all  Violence was pretty heavy for a PG movie lol  There was gun fights punching kidnapping tense senses were dogs are being shot villain killed by dog RPGS firing at kids no joke and some language such as D words  But other than that it was ok for kids  This girl beside was surprised at the PG rating  But I had fun with it  Good movie ,11
145675,1728번,Max,8,Max is the story of a military dog of the same name  When his owner was killed in Afganistan and comes back home  At first Justin wants nothing to do with the dog until he takes the responsability of caring for it   Max changed him from a bratty teenager to someone who takes responsibility for the things around him,4
145676,1728번,Max,8,My ratingPG13 for intense sequences of war violencesensualityand brief language,1
145696,1730번,Maya the Bee Movie,8,This was a really good movie  I watched it with my sisters Lara and Judi and they think its for babies  But this movie oh hoho this is something else  WATCH THIS MOVIE,4
145697,1730번,Maya the Bee Movie,8,This is a really good movie Its a little scarydramatic but most kids can probably handle this drama  I really love this movie at first I was too scared to watch but it was very funny and good Great message to care about others no matter what other people say,4
145698,1730번,Maya the Bee Movie,8,It is a very cute movie  I loved it when I watched it when I was little  It teaches us great life lessons such as bee youself get it   its not a spelling errorand it doesnt matter what you are and how you look on the outside but it is on the inside that really counts The movie has a lot of adventures in it and Im sure your kids will like it too,2
145699,1730번,Maya the Bee Movie,8,I think it is for kids 4 to 7,1
145860,1736번,Mean Girls,8,I really liked this movie because even though there are some inapropriate jokes its really funny and just makes you feel happy,1
145861,1736번,Mean Girls,8,Mean girls is a hilarious comedy it does have bitch said a few times aswell as fugly slut skeez and hobag  but its not that bad  it does have some refernces to sex and drugs but might fly over someine below the age of 11s head,4
145862,1736번,Mean Girls,8,i think that this movie is a really good movie some of the other parents say its disgusting but me and my mom watched it together when i was like 11  there is no f bombs and the language is not that bad  i think if your at least 10 you could watch it  the only scenes that are kinda weird are the ones that made me uncomfortable they include when regina  george was making out with i dont remember his name and her mom walked in and when an underaged girl made out with the coach  those are the scenes that made me uncomfortable  but over all its a really good movie and i think you should watch it when you get the chance ,5
145863,1736번,Mean Girls,8,This is one of the best movies ever along with clueless and 10 things I hate about u Follows the story of cady heron who has been homeschooled her whole life and lived in Africa  the plastics invite her to hang out with them  The plastics are rich and stupid popular girls and throughout the story there are some good and bad examples  But the end lesson is a rlly good lesson  Theres also a burn book where they gossip mean things about other girls and it teaches that gossip isnt ok  I DEFINITELY recommend,7
145864,1736번,Mean Girls,8,It is a great movie to watch with friends  Even though there is a lot of swearing and sex talk most preteens already know this and watch a lot of shows Movies that talk about it  I think it is for 12 up or kids that are a bit more mature  Overall its a great movie and definetly recomend,4
145865,1736번,Mean Girls,8,People may say that mean girls may have a terrible message and the characters are 3 dimensional but to be honest the whole plot and the society within the movie is so true  It portrays how even though  how nice everyone appears people still all hate each other within  It has a good message too  But its best that children should be more mentally mature to understand the whole plot,4
145866,1736번,Mean Girls,8,Good movie for middle school girls  Its a great movie It will teach them not to give into peer pressure   Many girls are mocked for being whoresvirginslesbiansetc  The teacher tells the girls not to call each other sluts and whores because it makes it ok for guys to call you sluts and whores  Nothing too sexually suggestive except Regina is seen in her bra and a boy named Shane in his underwear   Cady gets drunk and throws up  It has a happy ending although the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the relationship between Cady and Aaron was the most bland thing Ive ever seen in a movie,8
145867,1736번,Mean Girls,8,Your kids should probably watch this after they have the talk or something  Regina is a complete bword and manipulates everyone she meets  Cady is like Regina in one part near the end but mostly a good role model and a victim  Gretchen and Karen are Reginas dumb aword minions  Janis and Damian are OK but Janis can be a jerk but not really  All the adults are terrible role models  There is a pretty decent amount of swearing and a moderate amount of sex references  A little bit of violence as you would expect is a PG movie bloodless and nonscary  A moderate amount of drinkingdrugs   One joke that could be seen as racist  Some pretty good messages like cliques are bad and be yourself  So yeah I think it earned its 14,12
145868,1736번,Mean Girls,8,PG13 for sexual content strong language drinking and violence and a teen story,1
147358,1780번,Minecraft,8,Minecraft has been my favorite game since I was a kid Its fun interactive and you can see how much the producers really care about their community sure there is fighting but nor gore or blood and very little violence it also influences learning and strategy  Just so you know this is the same game that kicked Roblox and Fortnite off their thrones as the most famous games in the world so it may not look like much but try it youll like,3
147359,1780번,Minecraft,8,I see so many parents saying 18 super violent you can attack zombies  Are you kidding me That just sounds like someone who didnt like the game but cant come up with an excuse for why not  Minecraft was the first video game i ever owned and i get nostalgic thinking about it  You can build whatever you want and create entire worlds  Its perfect for someone like me who is currently creating a fantasy world by them self  Or maybe youre a kid who wants something to do to kill time  Or maybe youre a gamer who wants to go from start to finish in survival mode and beat the game in hardcore  Either way Minecraft is a great game for pretty much anyone,9
147360,1780번,Minecraft,8,I LOVE this game  It is so fun and has lots of educational value  It teaches kids how to build things and let their imagination run free  I recommend this to anyone,4
147361,1780번,Minecraft,8,I personally think this game is the best sandbox game  There are some differences from Windows 10 and Java edition  If I were you I would choose Java edition  When you first load into the world you are greeted with a tutorial on one of the top corners of the screen  I would recommend practicing the game in creative mode before going into survival mode  This game can and will take quite a bit of skill and training before actually playing it  I would be weary about joining servers  Depending on the people online you can either have a good or bad experience  There are some people that can bypass the filter and curse  I will recommend you get better at the game before using servers  Being the Teen that I am I rate Minecraft with a 5staf rating  Dont judge Minecraft just by YouTube videos made online,12
147362,1780번,Minecraft,8,You can do o much i recomend,1
147363,1780번,Minecraft,8,Very good game,2
147476,1780번,Minecraft,8,my moms always says im a slow learner  im 10 but im not too good at gramar  u dont need to know gramar for this game its just fun  my mom hasnt told me not to play this so i think its good  i go to church 3 times a week,5
147477,1780번,Minecraft,8,This game is fun can be educational and teaches kids about the value of hardwork  In this game you start on a world you have nothing but the trees and animals surrounding you  You need tobreak trees to get weapons and building materials  You can kill animals no blood to collect food and materials  Be sure to get into a shelter and night as zombies and other monsters will appear  Your challenge is to survive  If you find survival mode to difficult go onto creative mode which enables you to fly and have unlimited health and resources  If you havent got this game by now you need to get it  This game will be a classic for years to come  There are also a large variety of mods to play with  In this game you can find villagers who will trade with you  This teaches kids the value of items,12
147478,1780번,Minecraft,8,Minecraft is just a game that youll keep coming back to over and over again ive played it since 2012 and im still enjoying myself id say 3 because the most violent thing is when things die they fall over into a poof of smoke if your child is younger be careful that they dont go on servers as this could lead to it being potentially innaprorpiate but other then that its amazing the limit is your imagination If you install mods the possibilities increase even more if the device is older it might not be able to handle mods  mods are java edition only  With certain websites you can even make your own servers or if you have friends roudn you can play together on a mini server hosted on your internet only people connected to your internet can join overall its a very very fun game which I highly recommend,3
147479,1780번,Minecraft,8,Minecraft is an amazing sandbox style game that encourages creativity and helps a LOT in learning   Although if your child  is 67 yrs old I suggest NOT to use multiplayer mode  If your child is scared  or may feel uncomfortable with monsters in the game you can change it to peaceful mode  Also in creative mode you have all resources and can build anything This is why Minecraft is excellent for kids 6,5
147480,1780번,Minecraft,8,I will now say my recomendations for parents   When your kid starts playing the game i recommend that it starts to play in creative mode to get a spice of the game  Creative mode lets you build what you want get unlimited items so the player will not have to survive  I also recommend giving them a guide they are online  Let them play creative mode for 1 week  1 month until they become good to the game  When they start playing survival get them a guide  If you not your child will probably start saying How i craft     and WHY A ZOMBIE KILLS ME EVERYTIME every 510 minutes  And whats going to happen is that they will be playing the game for about 1 month AND STILL have made no progress  Why Because to progress in minecraft is hidden  Thats why you need a guide  Your child in 1 month will have crafted 0 items and will die every 5 minutes  The hidden progression that is never explained in the game there is no tutorial is Get wood  Get crafting table  get a sword  get more items,15
147481,1780번,Minecraft,8,You can build anything you like you can do everything it powers imagination I say you should get this for your sondaughter at 6 to 15 yes to 15,2
147482,1780번,Minecraft,8,Personally I think Minecraft is AMAZING   I have been playing it for a week already and I  am addicted to it,3
147483,1780번,Minecraft,8,The game Minecraft is very mild and fun for the whole family  The game costs seven dollars  It is a very fun came but it may cause some friction and frustration  The only violence is  when your character slashes a sword at a pixalated zombie or spider  Minecraft definitly lost its popularity but its still fun  I also completely disagree with its E10 rating  Minecraft is the perfect game for your child definitly consider it for a Hannucha Christmas or Birthday gift,7
147484,1780번,Minecraft,8,I first got this game when I was about 9 years old and I was stunned at how awesome it truly was  It is more of a sandbox game than anything else but it is made well  If you do not have this game already I would recommend that you buy it right now  It endorses imagination as it allows you to build anything youd like In fact in some schools in Sweden it is taught as a mandatory subject in school  This game fosters creativity and is a great way for children to express themselves and build great things  They can even make things like machines with redstone  There is a bit of violence though  you can kill monsters animals and other players but it is not overly graphic or overthetop,7
147485,1780번,Minecraft,8,Obviously you can build anything you want unless your in survivial mode you would have repeat getting more material so you can have   Blocks by being in creative,1
147627,1780번,Minecraft,8,ITS GREAT ITS A LEGEND,1
147628,1780번,Minecraft,8,It is agreat game with a lot of possibilities for what to do but it gets old and boring after awhile  Common sense media over exaggerated about the learning and positive role models,2
147629,1780번,Minecraft,8,Its a fun game  Kids can build and create their own worlds caution if you give this app to your kidsthey will play it for hours  It encourages creativity,3
147630,1780번,Minecraft,8,Addictive and fun,1
147631,1780번,Minecraft,8,This is Quality Buy it People dont buy it cuz it costs 26 95 but it is worth it The Educational value shows kids how to survive the wild dont punch trees with ur hand It also shows you how to be creative The minecraft developers are funny and cool  Easter Eggs are everywhere Same with April fools jokes This is a funny and cool game and i reccomend any Parent buying this The Graphics are awesome News and updates get better and better This is the best game on the market  Also The Community is so friendly No account hackers Not as many bullies as robloxand no online daters This is amazing,15
147632,1780번,Minecraft,8,This game is super simplistic and tons of fun It fosters creativity by allowing kids to build in a sandbox with limitless possibilities  I see a lot of parents here complaining about mods and online interactions  Mods can only be installed through the PC version and take quite a bit of effort  So sex and gun mods shouldnt be an issue  As for online people are jerks  Thats unavoidable,7
147633,1780번,Minecraft,8,not too bad although i mean for those who are christians it has some probably can be called demonic contents and relationship with satandemons and the antichrist How do i know well on youtube and the game you can see some bad things like whatwell if you play at 3am on pocket editionnot sure of other versionsyou will see some demons and the antichrist sign i had it before i and my bro were so into iti told my friends about it they were enchanted whats my well later i deleted it,1
147634,1780번,Minecraft,8,I think the game is safe for 8 year olds  Maybe 7  The game has some violence such as hittingkilling animals or mobs   It teaches you about survival and gathering food out in the wilderness  It also is great for building and planning things  I use it to build and design houses and buildings,6
147635,1780번,Minecraft,8,In multiplayeryou can get bad words in chat  but you can also get positive messages   Everything can happen with modifications   You can also accecedentally say some private informations,3
147636,1780번,Minecraft,8,Its one of my favorite video games and I think its really creative   Im just going to warn people it does have a lot of violence   Its not really a bad kind of violence because youre technically killing to survive   Its good,4
147637,1780번,Minecraft,8,Minecraft is a Mojang created blocky graphics building simulator in which the player survives against hostile mobs hunger and the environment  The violence in this game consists of using weaponry such as pick axes swords Bows axes and other material you find around the world   There is no blood or gore unless one  downloads a mod that imports such content  Minecraft also does not have foul language unless the player is in multiplayer online mode where other players can interact with each other sometimes using foul language  Some of the foul language consists of the words cock dick fuck and ass plus others etc  Players also can make custom skins for themselves which can be revealing showing body parts such as boobs penises and butts  There is also  potion brewing in the game where certain potions can poison you or slow your speed  Also when eating a puffer fish in the game your screen will blur and life will go down simulating a druglike effect  Parents should also be concerned about privacy as people have been hacked  Overall my rating for minecraft would be,10
147638,1780번,Minecraft,8,This game is amazing  There really is no violence aside form killing animals players or hostile mobs but its not graphic  Players can play the game without anyone or anything to kill  This game encourages you to be creative  Minecraft is the type of game that anyone can sit down and enjoy,5
147639,1780번,Minecraft,8,Besides the PC version other versions are boring like Minecraft PE Minecraft W10 etc,1
147640,1780번,Minecraft,8,Maybe you have thought about building an house from scratch   Yet you have no bricks you may have thought another time about surving in the wild    Yet your too scared to take the risk  Ladies and Gentlemen a solution has been found and even better you can achieve anything you want on one single video game     Minecraft is a fun creative and fantastic way to bring out your creative side no matter who you are and what age you maybe Minecraft will bring a smile to your face this one single game gives you the option to create what ever you want from as simple as a brick house or as extravagant as a Iron Spaceship  Not your cup of tea Minecraft offers a survival mode and so from a click of a button your are based  with nothing and are left to fund for your self in the wild  The game is compatible on just about anything from the comfort of your home computer to your portible tablets and mobile phones  Overally I think this game rocks and I recommend it to anyone who is willing to pay Its amazingly cheap price  My hat off to Mojang and the other publishers of this game  FANTASTIC,10
147641,1780번,Minecraft,8,Its fantastic  Creative mode is perfect for building anything from the Empire State Building to a small cottage  Survival is in my opinion slightly more violent as there are monsters  There is a Peaceful mode though so you can always turn them off  In Survival you need to gather your resources by mining and stuff  People from 7 year olds to adults will love the creativity  Parents can play with their kids too  In multiplayer servers players can act badly but the best and most popular servers have a reporting system  I dont think parents should let their kids on Multiplayer until theyre at least 10 though   All in all its stupendous  Play it,11
147642,1780번,Minecraft,8,An open world sandbox game that is randomly generated      The game also features a creative mode where the player is invincible has an unlimited supply of everything can fly and break blocks easily  Welcome to Minecraft A World where you can do anything Google Summary Minecraft offers two worldsSurvival and Creative  In Creative you have no lives build anything discover villages fly and more Survival is a little more tricky you are given 10 hearts and need to collect things for a shelter food and escape monsters who could kill  I would worry a little about safety and privacy because you can interact with other people online  Theres a LOT of consumerism like Tshirts movies books and other things   Yet its very easy to play and I would suggest playing a lot Set a time limit though because its very addicting building things Minecraft is a great game for any video game users,12
147643,1780번,Minecraft,8,It is amazing I can discover new things every day like the nether and end build buildings and go on survival adventures and see how long i can live  Also there are wonderful servers with many enjoyable games  Plus your friends can play with you whether you are playing in a server or in one of your own worlds  I enjoy customizing and looking for new skins that I will wear  SO MUCH FUN,6
147644,1780번,Minecraft,8,Minecraft is a mildly violent video game that inspires kids creativity through building in creative mode  Survival mode allows players to fight monsters and upgrade and craft various items  However there is the ability to play with other players on servers or play on local wifi network games called LAN,3
147645,1780번,Minecraft,8,This game is so fun you can play it on a PC laptop Xbox 360  Mobile Xbox One PS3 PS4 Wii U and Nintendo Switch  no matter what console or other device you own Minecraft is awesome although there tends to be a bit of violence but theres not any blood or gore in it and just a great game in general,2
147646,1780번,Minecraft,8,great game In the game you really have to use your mind  they should have called it mind craft ha ha ha just joking for mums and dads dont really have to know about the game  check with your mum and dad before buying the game,6
148105,1780번,Minecraft,8,AWESOME,1
148106,1780번,Minecraft,8,This game is horrible as itself  The survival is fun at first go to the minecraft wiki for help on crafting recipes but it devolves into mining for hours on end  The creative is good but due to the blocky nature of the game it takes thousands of blocks to create a realistic build that looks good and said build is ginormous so having friends to help is essential  However this is where the game gets fun  You see Notch didnt say you couldnt mess with the game you just cant sell it illegally  The result Thousands hundreds of thousands of mods that CHANGE your game to whatever you want  Adding armor blocks dimensions anything at all You want it theres a mod for it  And if youre the creative kind of guy download WorldEdit helping you build faster using commands  Then theres the multiplayer  Avoid faction servers unless they are really new unless you like dying to people wearing enchanted diamond armor absolute best armor in the game unless you have a mod with better armor  And most people who play on such servers are 6 year olds who think its cool to swear like the devil himself and the game doesnt have a default sensor system   But other servers have plugins multiplayer version of mods that completely change the game to something else  Popular gamemodes are Ghostcraft basically the hidden in minecraft survival games is a classic hungergames Trouble in minevile trouble in terrorist town and minez dayz  The current craze is supercraftbros supersmashbros in minecraft,15
148107,1780번,Minecraft,8,This is the best PC game ever invented The only thing to worry about is some semicreepy monsters that try to hunt you down and kill you  If your child doesnt like long games dont introduce them to it  You must collect lots of materials some of them taking a long time to collect  WARNING To make certain things you must know the combinations to put them in  It is best to know someone who has lots of experience with minecraft,6
148108,1780번,Minecraft,8,This game is great for any child teen or adult  It involves lots of fun learning that can be had  For on e the game is 100 customizable  With using mods and resource packs  You can do anything from changing the way dirt looks to getting a pet cat and naming it nemo You can also change the way you look with minecraft novaskin me and many other fun and exciting things  Although a visit to youtube with be needed to help  Id suggest looking at TheDiamondMinecart for help,8
148109,1780번,Minecraft,8,This game is the one that got me into gaming Its a sandbox and open world game and there is a very loose story in the form of going to the nether and then the end  Its all about exploring and finding the items needed to survive  There is a massive community and a lot of public servers but be carefull as some server are cracked and can take your password and username  Trolls and griefers are also a problem on public servers there are however nice servers out there and most servers will ban griefers  Also a nother thing is its addticting nature of the game as I am at school for 89 hours a day and during term time I never had time for minecraft but during the hoildays that would shoot up to 89 hours ON minecraft a day I have gotten over it now but I would tell parnets to watch their childs play time on minecraft  There is also a massive modding community and a look though some of the mods is a good idea  Over all its a great game and is worth every penny,8
148110,1780번,Minecraft,8,When everyone is says NOT FOR KIDS probably millions of kids from 4at least 50 I personally love the game it is a game of blocks where you can,1
148111,1780번,Minecraft,8,awesome game better than roblox it doesnt have sex profanity etc,1
148112,1780번,Minecraft,8,Haha This is fun,2
148113,1780번,Minecraft,8,get mine craft its worth every penny GET IT,2
148114,1780번,Minecraft,8,I like to play Minecraft whenever I have the time to  You can craft and mine and do lots of other things  And you could learn stuff from it to  You can learn to craft and smelt things like how i learnt that glass is made from sand  You also explore caves and kill zombies and other creatures  And there is no blood  But Its so addicting that there is 16000000 and more players,7
148408,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,I loved this movie but it is definitely a PreTeen movie,1
148409,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,I didnt really like this movie  I mean the love story was cute and everything but the plot seems very plain and simple  Al least to me  Fine for kids there is  nothing confusing about the plot  Its very simple  One thing I found annoying was the dialogue for some reason it seemed very very cheesy to me,7
148410,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,It is a great movie although it has a little bit of violence in it  That is the only reason i chose 8 and up,2
148411,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,i tried to watch this movie and couldnt even sit though it all  its so cliche that its disturbing,2
148412,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,Contins some fantasy action and mild rude humor,1
148413,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,This film sends out an importanat message that judging someone by their appearence is not OK and that greed and beeing vain wont get you very far in life,1
148414,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,I love this film Its great that snow white gets to be the fighter for once Snow white is really pretty  ,4
148415,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,It wasnt very good I was definitely dissappointed  It was boring for older kids and adults yet contained lots of dirty humor that was not appropriate for younger ages  Not even worth a dollar at Redbox,3
148416,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,in one point the prince pounces on the queen and licks her facealso the dwarfs will start trying to kill each other with weapons drunk  the 5 year old i was babysitting seemed to like it  this is a very good movie at the end the prince and snow white seal there love with a kiss good for kids 5 and up probaly,3
148417,1787번,Mirror Mirror,3,I think it was a little violent but Im a girl and 10 and to me it was fine  I reccomend being 9 to watch  Just because it might be hard to understand,3
148494,1788번,Misery,8,I think Misery was a great movie but there is too much profanity  LANGUAGE There are several uses of St  one use of Fk and words like dirty bird from Annie  Paul writes fk in a type writer about 6 times  Paul also flips Annie the bird once   DRINKING DRUGS AND SMOKING Annie consistently drugs Paul and there is several scenes with smoking  Wine is drank in 1 scene  VIOLENCE There is a lot of violence in this film  The movie starts out with a car crash  At the end there is a pretty brutal fight scene they are hitting each other with anvil type things The movie is pretty creepy overall  Annie shows up standing up by his bed when he is sleeping  She breaks both of his ankles  Overall this movie is great and I think a mature 1112 year old can handle it,13
148495,1788번,Misery,8,I watched this movie a while ago and I did find it to be a little disturbing and pretty dang unsettling but it wasnt that bad  There was some language as well like a middle finger and one spoken f word and c sucker is said once as well  The sledgehammer scene was also very disturbing and had unsettling music in the background but I say that 13 and up can see this movie and maybe a mature 12 year old,3
148496,1788번,Misery,8,Sex 210,1
148497,1788번,Misery,8,It was very well written a chilling movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat but be warned this movie WILL give you nightmares,1
148498,1788번,Misery,8,This movie is definatly not appropriate for any children under 15 or 14  It is not as much scary as violent  Paul Sheldon as the bones in his feet broken and one of them is onscreen he screams and the ending fight is very violent  Their is also some language and 1 finger but like I said this is not for kids  Reviews on here say its okay for 10 year olds  Definatly not  As far as how good the movie itself is it is good but not as good as the book which kids shouldnt read eathir but Kathy Bates preforms her role very well and plays Annie Wilkes great,7
148499,1788번,Misery,8,I watched this movie when i was 11 and i was fine but i was also watching slashers at that age,1
148500,1788번,Misery,8,Brief strong violence with some swearing  Nowhere near as violent and profanity filled as most of his other movies  This is an amazing movie thats good for kids 12 and up or younger if violence doesnt disturb them and they dont repeat some of the words because this is one many Stephen King movies that isnt scary,3
148501,1788번,Misery,8,This movie was fine but not my favorite  It had some language but it was pretty mild R with only a few F words  The movie does have a few scenes of violence mostly towards the end but there is one scene in the middle that is extremely tough to watch and not for the squeamish  In this scene a woman puts a wooden block in between his legs next to his ankles and breaks them with a sledge hammer and this is the most hard to watch scene  This whole movie is very intense and scary but I think a mature ten cold handle it if they dont see the ankle scene,5
148502,1788번,Misery,8,I watched this movie last night and Im 9 some parts are violent but its suitable for 9 and up  The hammer scene was a bit graphic though,2
148572,1794번,Miss Persona,5,Miss Persona is so funny She dresses up as all sorts of fun people And she also helps her friends by dressing up Its a really cool tv show to sum it up,4
148677,1803번,Moana,5,Moana is an excellent movie There are strong positive role models and even the negative ones I mean Maui become good role models and make up for their mistakes towards the end  This movie has some scares but kids ages 6 or 7 and up should be able to handle it  There is some potty language typical for kids movies but it doesnt go beyond appropriate  The music here is also wonderful  This is a great movie for kids and I recommend watching it,6
148678,1803번,Moana,5,To much singing if you hate it when ur kids sing the song for ages the dont watch if not then 10 out of 10 would lemur again,1
148679,1803번,Moana,5,I loved Moana  It is very beautiful and entertaining  I recommend for ages 6 and older because some scenes can be potentially frightening for younger viewers  However it is very wonderful,4
148680,1803번,Moana,5,I put 4 and up because there really isnt a reason a four year old shouldnt watch this  Honestly I think even if you have a kid that is three or younger itd be fine  I just wasnt sure because there is a part with kind of like a lava fire monster lady thing  She didnt come off as too scary to me although I am 15 so I have no idea how your 2 year old would react to someone throwing fireballs and being made out of lava and rock  Other than that the movie is great Moana is such a wholesome Disney princess Shes got a great attitude and for once I love where the storyline isnt about finding a prince  Great movie and the songs are beautiful  Oh also I wouldnt show your kids this no matter their age if someone in the family just passed  In this movie Moanas grandmother dies sorry spoiler and it is sad  Moanas grandmother dies peacefully though,11
148681,1803번,Moana,5,Moana is a movie about a young woman who ventures outside of her island in order to restore the heart to a goddess  It has great messages because it shows how you sometimes have to have courage to do what is right even if everybody else is doing wrong  The great role models are Moana and Maui  Moana is a couragous and brave leader who goes on a daring quest to restore peace  Maui helps Moana along her quest even though he is the one that caused everything to be destroyed in the first place  It has some violence and some creatures and monsters that could be frightening for young kids  There is a lava monster who eventually turns into the goddess as well as a giant crab and coconut pirates with weapons  There are some thunderstorms and lightening that happen while Moana is out on the ocean which could also be scary  It is worth noting that while Moana is a kidfriendly movie most of the female characters wear skirts and a bikini top and all of the males wear just skirts  The women who arent wearing skirts and bikini tops are wearing revealing dresses so you might want to consider that  Some mild language is used but nothing that would be extremely inappropraite for a tenyearold as long as they know not to repeat it  There are a few scenes where Maui tells Moana that she is going to get killed and one where he says that the entrance to the crabs palace wont appear unless he makes a human sacrafice  Moana also says inappropriate things throughout the movie some nearswearwords but no actual swear words  Moanas grandmother dies in the beginning of the movie though it is not shown onscreen  It is also shown how Moanas fathers friend drowned in the ocean when he was a young man  There is also a scene at the beginning of the movie that shows a man being forced to get a painful tattoo  Another thing is that all of the adult characters have tattoos and I wasnt a huge fan of how it promoted tattoos especially in that first scene  Maui also goes to the bathroom in the water and leaves Moana to feel the water afterwards and that part was very gross  If there wasnt as much violence or innappropriate content I would reccommend this movie for ages six and up  No consumerism or innappropriate substances are present  Overall Moana is a great animated movie and is one of my favorite animated movies of all time  but I would highly reccommend it for ages ten and older only  It was marketed as a kidfriendly movie but I see it as a movie more for tweens and older kids,22
148682,1803번,Moana,5,Good  Some funny parts like the dart put in Mauis pottyprivate part  And positive models  You have to see this  You might even give it 5 stars Really good movie  Id probably rate it 5,7
148683,1803번,Moana,5,Well it is good but I saw a bit of disqusting things but it was only one,1
148684,1803번,Moana,5,He was heralded as the first and only WWE member and it turned out he was actually a Hawaiian demigod  His name was Maui and he got his powers from a magic hook  He gave humans many gifts and decided to steal life magic from the island lady  It turns out that was a bad idea and he was attacked by the lava guy  Oops  But then he meets Moan who is a princess from a village and shes like give the life thing back to the island lady  So Mauis like No but then hes like ok so its gucci  But Maui doesnt have the life thingy so they have to get it from a shiny crab man named Tomato  They almost die but then Moan gets the life thingy  Oh yeah theres also an immortal chicken  Then they  go to fight the lava guy but Mauis hook gets broke  Then Maui is like Im sad  Moan is like I am Moan  Then she goes to fight the lava guy again  Oh and the ocean is sentient so anyway she goes to fight the lava guy again  Maui comes back and helps DONT READ AHEAD IF U DONT WANT SPOILERS Then ooo plot twist the lava guy is the island girl but without the life thingy  The the island girl gives maui a new hook cuz he broke his  Moans village gets saved and they become seatravelers again  The end  Or is it  Moan 2 coming to theaters in 1995,22
148685,1803번,Moana,5,I liked this film because of the courage this film shows  The music was good in the film and it is very entertaining but the movie is kind of violent so I think it is ok for People 8 and up,2
148686,1803번,Moana,5,Moana is great   I liked the singing   There are some parts that are scary  Its a funny movie because of Hehe and Pua theyre so great,4
148745,1803번,Moana,8,Took the 3yo goddaughter to see this today at PimmiPlayHouse a place that plays movies that have already left the theater  She was alarmed by the sea crab and asked to leave  I had already seen the movie and obliged to leave because she was crying   I think she was just too young for it  Maybe in a couple of years well try this movie again,5
148746,1803번,Moana,8,Moana is really good for any children wanting an adventurous movie with a female main character  There are lots of great songs and I really think Moana and Maui are good role models for little children  They dont give up or at least they come back to face the problem  It was a little scary foy my younger brother but otherwise it is great in every way,4
148747,1803번,Moana,8,I thought that it was very predictable but over all it was pretty sweet,1
148748,1803번,Moana,8,the movie is ok but on here you cant watch it,1
148749,1803번,Moana,8,Moana is an awesome movie Moana Maui and other characters show role models that other people should follow  Also children can get a feel for ancient Polynesian culture  Other than that the movie is curious thrilling and just hilarious,4
148750,1803번,Moana,8,your kids will drown in boredom  Oh ya ps the star actor is World Wrestling Championthe rock,2
148751,1803번,Moana,8,This is a Disney movie that is filled with bravery   A young girl named Moana sets off on a boat to save her island    She meets a demigod named Maui and they journey and they meet a craband a huge lava monster   They are fun catchy songs that are appropriate for kids   The language is not bad at all but they are some violent scenes Hope this review was good,5
148752,1803번,Moana,8,so good great for families,2
148753,1803번,Moana,8,Great animation film about a heroic girl who seeks for adventure  Its perfect for kids and families  has great music and good visual  Has some scary moments but nothing too intense   Its one of the best animation films of the year and its nominated for two Oscars,4
148754,1803번,Moana,8,It has good music humoranamationcharacters,1
149630,1822번,"Monsters, Inc.",5,Before reading Id like you to know that I tried not to put any spoilers in my review  Happy reading I recently watched this movie for the first time  I didnt think Id like it as much as I did  The visuals are pretty good  Everything looks pretty realistic  I think it was kind of funny  The monsters may scare young children  There were some insults though  There are some great messages families can have talks about  Same with the great rolemodels  I hope you see this movie and thank you for reading,12
149631,1822번,"Monsters, Inc.",5,Yeh language warning my a,1
149632,1822번,"Monsters, Inc.",5,I really enjoyed it  I think its great to watch it with family but its a little,2
149633,1822번,"Monsters, Inc.",5,Monsters Inc is a good movie but they scenes get wild such as,1
149634,1822번,"Monsters, Inc.",5,I enjoyed watching Mike and Sully  go to new places communicate with different characters and  fight off the main baddies,1
149635,1822번,"Monsters, Inc.",5,Sorry about commensense media forgot things,1
149636,1822번,"Monsters, Inc.",5,The movie is about monsters  Theyre trying to make electricity  The movie was about getting the baby home,3

150371,1858번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,I was traumatized when I first saw it and it still creeps me out for some reason,1
150372,1858번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,Its a very funny movie that does not need to be rated PG13  I watched it when I was 10 and my sister who is 9 saw it at 8  It has a good message and good acting  There are some swear words and a few mildly inappropriate references but its not that bad and it will easily go over younger peoples head  Its very funny and I recommender for families,5
150373,1858번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,This is a great movie for everyone to watch whether or not they have gone through a divorce because it is absolutely hilarious and lets the kids know that even if the parents dont love each other anymore they still love them  I say 10 for language some sexual jokes and brief arguingyelling,2
150374,1858번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,This film is really good Im being honest its my 3rd favorite movie behind Schindlers List and Jurassic Park  But just like with those other two films Mrs  Doubtfire is one of the greatest films of 1993 and it does a good job on setting you up in an emotional place  For example there are some times throughout the film where you are probably laughing so hard where you cant breath or some times where you cry feeling emotional due to how the characters feel  Because the plot of the story is emotional which shows a couple being divorced and the dad disguises himself thanks to his brother and its actually a good idea for a comedydrama film  However I can not let this movie go without adding some critique to it OK so lets start with the fact that there is a few sexual references throughout the movie but thats why its got the PG13 rating and a majority of them will probably go over kids heads  Also for a Robin Williams comedy there is a lot of language the website says that there was an F word in the film but I watched the movie twice and I did not hear any F bombs in it  This is a very good movie its understandable of making 2nd place at the box office during the time it was released and this is a good movie for 11 but anyone under than that should definitely have a parent or guardian with them,7
150375,1858번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,This movie is hilarious  I couldnt stop laughing  The father of 3 kids dresses up as a nanny to be with his kids  He faces many obstacles that are very funny to watch  A Great  family pick for some good laughs,5
150376,1858번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,Every kid of every age will find this movie funny though kids of 11 will probably get the jokes  it is a delightful look at what happens when a divorced father pretends to be a prim English nurse  Some inexplicably vulgar sexual content when he overtly quizzes the mother on her sex life and warns Stu Pierce Brosnan about some of her sex life  Occasional sex jokes but mostly a family movie  Robin Williams is cute and very good at imitations Harvey Fierstein is consistently entertaining and Sally Field provides a relieving gravitas  Definitely recommended,6
150377,1858번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,Great movie for families very very very funny  I highly recommend it,2
150378,1858번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,I remember when i first watched this movie didnt really understand it but i watched it again a few years later and loved it,1
150379,1858번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,This movie was hallarious but did have words such as motherf  kers  tassand much more,1
150514,1864번,Mulan (2020),8,Why do I say this Well to begin the acting is truly amazing the battle scenes are epic and the movie has an overall pretty cool vibe to it,2
150515,1864번,Mulan (2020),8,I am  a girl and 12  I think that this movie is not as violent as it might seem  When I first read all the comments and reviews I was worried if it was appropriate for me but when I watched the movie I found that it wasnt that scary at all  There isnt any inappropriate scenes for younger viewers  It is very entertaining and inspiring  A great movie for 9 up,6
150516,1864번,Mulan (2020),8,I thought it was good Most people are stewing about the bathing scene but it was shown in a clever and nonsexual way and I thought it wasnt much of an issue  Barely any profanities and not much violence  It showed female strength and that was one of the best parts I would totally recommend,5
150517,1864번,Mulan (2020),8,I really dont know why everyone says this isnt a great movie  I watched it right when it came out and it was way better than I expected  There isnt much violence and the characters are really well played  If you are thinking of watching this I highly recommend it,4
150518,1864번,Mulan (2020),8,Honestly the nudity was probably worse than the violence but just so you know this is the violence 1 The worst violence scene is the final fight scene SPOILER SPOILER,1
150519,1864번,Mulan (2020),8,Its a fine movie but it subtracts one of the main charectors Mushu,1
150520,1864번,Mulan (2020),8,The movie was Very good   I think that kids can watch this because shes only throwing them around there is no blood even when she stabs them no blood on the sword Positive role model for girls  The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is they took the dragon out He was funny,4
150521,1864번,Mulan (2020),8,Mulan 2020 is really not as bad people say  I really enjoyed watching this movie as it was exciting  I would say for kids 11 up because there was quite a bit of violence which could scare younger children  I would recommend,4
150522,1864번,Mulan (2020),8,I loved this movie so much and I think its a great message for kids about womans strength and power  It was very attention grabbing and I honestly dont understand why so many people dislike this movie  Well yes there is a few pieces of the cartoon movie that arent in the live action but I reckon it makes it better because its more realistic and there is a whole new character in this movie that gets rid of the dissapointment that mushu doesnt show up  Thanks for reading my review if you have gotten this far I 100 reccomend,4
150606,1865번,Mulan,6,My favourite film of all time been watching it since I was 5 years old,1
150607,1865번,Mulan,6,This movie is wayyyyyy better then the remake watch this one instead,1
150608,1865번,Mulan,6,Honestly this movie is just amazing all around  Great messages for kids great characters actual drama and emotion and great music  It does get a bit dark at points but doesnt have anything too graphic,3
150609,1865번,Mulan,6,The only thing I would object to in this film is the nudity when Mulan is bathing but the men come there too  Otherwise a great film with great role models,2
150610,1865번,Mulan,6,Mulan is one of my favorite movies  It shows a strong independent woman who helps fight for her country  I think its great for 5 because it has a happy ending and I personally dont think the fight scenes are very intense  AWESOME MOVIE GO WATCH IT,5
150611,1865번,Mulan,6,Its a great Disney movie but its story is misleading as like Pocahontas before it it suffers from being very inaccurate  But I dont blame Disney for sugar coating this movie as the real Mulan committed suicide after her service because she was going to be made a concubine  I will say that other than being watered down into a fantasy adventure film is really good and there is comic relief  Thats a story about Asian people  Mulan is a one of the great role models for children and she is worth for fighting for  She doesnt want her father to go to war like a military and she becomes strong  She takes her fathers place  Also a 16 year old girl like other Disney Princesses such as Aurora Moana Ariel and Merida  Mulan is the first place most good Disney Princess  Though it has war violence like theres too many Hun army to destroy Shangs in the mountains  We have 2000 Huns 4000 of them in real life  I dont know why there is so many Hun soldiers who want to take over China  There is a village called Tung Shao Pass that was destroyed by the Huns  There is high body count you can see dead soldiers and horses especially the poor little girl who lost her Lilo doll  A main antagonist ShanYu invades Chinese castle and he passed away in the fireworks bomb  ShanYu is one of the underrated Disney Villains but Mulans a Disney masterpiece  Some people are not allowed to coloring their scleras because its really painful for your eyes  ShanYu has black ink on his eyes that makes him scary and looks like hes having a night vision  I forgot that he has sith eyes  I have sensitive eyes but I couldnt stop thinking about him when I was 9 and I wish I had to change my eye color with powers  Im so obsessed with Mulan at the age of 9 and I really want to try to watch it  Okay also worth noting that theres some sexual jokes in the movie and a very akward skinny dippingbathing scene in which you see Yao standing up on a rock in front of Mulan  The viewer doesnt see anything but its implied that Mulan did as she tells Mushu that she never wants to see a naked guy ever again at which point a bunch of nude men run past  Has plenty of jokes that might go over the kids heads but will keep grown ups laughing  Even LiShangs back is shown and Mulan gets stunned  LiShang looks so hot though  Lets get down to business to defeat the Huns is going to be acronym for LGBT and some theorists think that Shang is gay or Bisexual  It has funny scenes like the Matchmakers butt becomes fire fart Mushu is being Batman and some scenes are funny  I have an only problem that Mulan is having a big ears and thats too funny for the Disney Princess films  There is also ShanYu is thicc I bet that he may be thicc as Thanos you Mulan fans may find it funny  I couldnt stop laughing Some fans may complain that ShanYu being attractive I dont think so So anyways The Animation is great and stunning great characters and amazing plot  Thats a historical inaccurate but the Disney movie made the original legend even better I recommend for ages 5 or 6  Great job Disney Though I will be 15 to see a release date of live action Mulan it has different characters different plot and it will release Aug 21 2020  Maybe fans of animated Mulan will might be disappointed,40
150612,1865번,Mulan,6,So I LOVEEE this movie but there is a LOTTA  VIOLENCE,1

150722,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,This was the first muppets movie I ever watched and I loved it The muppets are one of my favorite movie franchises,2
150723,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,Really Good  Not Much to Say  No Content  Does have positve messages and role models though,4
150724,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,Its such a good Muppet movie as they all are  One of the best,2
150725,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,This sequel is certainly more intense and has a lot more action and suggestive moments then the first  Kids should be older and it will not appeal to crowds older then 13,2
150726,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,For longtime Muppet fans this movie will entertain and excite  For younger children they may be frightened by some scenes but the action is more entertaining than straightup horrorstyle,2
150727,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,It is super good but there are some loud scenes where they are breaking in  and it is a really good movie,1
150728,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,I watched this when it came out a long time ago and it was SUPER scary  I think I can handle it now though ,2
150729,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,This is the worst movie I have seen in ages  Way to scary for muppet loving kids  The person who came up with the idea of this Horror yes I said it  Horror  movie is nuts  Mad,6
150730,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,This is what you get if you mixed who framed roger rabbit with the great muppet caper  Oh its too dark did you read the plot before seeing this movie  My then 3 year old cousin now 5 saw this with me on opening day and she actually enjoyed it  This movie delivers a message about honesty Kermit tries to tell the truth that hes not Constantine,4
150731,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,My ratingPG for violence,1
150732,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Mild violence,1
150733,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,This Muppet sequel doesnt reach its high standards as the 2011 film but it is great just the way it is  This movie brings a lot of heart and gags that I am sure are capable of entertaining people of all ages  This movie is good for all ages even little ones,3
150734,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Hilarious Perfect for all kids but some may not understand all the jokes  The reason I didnt give it a higher rating was because I almost fell asleep during the film,3
150735,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,i wanted to see this movie when it came out  i liked the first one a little better,2
150736,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,While not without its flaws this muppet film is a great one with a nice caper plot and some great writting  Though some of the characters are off with Fozzie being dumb the gang not recognizing the difference between a frog and their friend of four decades and a in your face moral followindg the climax it still manages to hold up with some great songs a really good plot and the pairing of Sam the Eagle and Ty Burrell is one of the films strong points  For kids there are some violent scenes including explosions and bombs that might scare them and not much else that would be inappropriate for kids  Overal great film and an improvement on its more human focused predecessor,4
150737,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,My mother took me and my two younger brothers 10 and 8 despite my refusals  The advertisements seemed to bore me and really didnt grab my attention  It wasnt worth the eight dollars per ticket  I understood the humor but I still didnt like the movie  Maybe it is just me but talking muppets really dont grab the attention of an adolescent,5
150738,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,This movie is not as great as the first and money wasting,1
150739,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Not as good as The Muppets which I really adore but still worth watching  It has some funny scenes  The cameo appearances was a surprise  Ricky Gervais was good Tina Fey was funny but for me Ty Burrell stole the show with Sam The Eagle  They were hilarious  At least the songs were catchy,6
150740,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Truly I thought it was good   It has a lesson in it dont judge a book by its cover because Kermit was taken to jail because he looked like the bad frog in the movie also there were great messages in the movie but only a few bad words like butt stupid ect   So truly in think you and your family should watch this movie together   Its great for family movie night,4
150741,1871번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Do you like unpredictable movies Do you like movie that makes  you jump If so you would  love the muppets most wanted  I rate it 4 stars it is good for 6 year olds and up There is some parts in the movie that makes you jump If you are looking for a quiet movie this is not right movie to go to  There is lot of famous characters like for  example Ross Lynch from Austin and Ally and a ton more that you might know   It is a pg movie once again I rate it 4 stars out of 5 star,8
151148,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,I LOVED this movie when I was little and I still do  Its great for young and sensitive kids because the violence is minimal and most of the story revolves around the Totoro and his friends,2
151149,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This is an adorable movie that me and my younger sister loved Totoro is super nice he tries to cheer up the girls when their mom doesnt come home from the hospital and he stands with them in the rain while the girls wait for their dad to come home  Satski goes looking everywhere for her sister showing positive roll models and good messages  There are some little ghost things called soot sprites which maybe be sort of creepy for kids under the age of 3  But otherwise I loved it Didnt know Dakota Fanning was in it either,7
151150,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Despite the popularity of the movie I didnt find it very good  The plot wasnt super interesting but I find its more for younger viewers,2
151151,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Was a bit bored for the first 20 minutes but I ended up really enjoying it,1
151152,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,its awsome but people always say the bath scene inappropriate should not be in movie NO LIKE SHUT UR MOUTH PEOPLE back then people did not have a hot water so they had to heat it up and that took long and was a lot of work thats why,2
151153,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Every time I see chubby bunny rat it scares me  Especially on the cover the way its eyes are opened wide and its half way in the shade And the MOUTH AHHH so scary would CERTAINLY freak out little kids,4
151154,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is a Japanese film for kids and doesnt contain anything bad,1
151155,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,I and all my family LOVE this movie It is great I think its awesome because it has a great positive message and it shows two girls that are sisters that moved to a different place and only with their dad because Their mom is in the hospital  It doesnt show anything scary about the mom being in the hospital because shes just a little sick  Though I do think parents should know is that theres one part where the older sister is afraid her mom will get really sick and something will happen to her and shell die but its appropriate and not scary at all even for little kids,5
151156,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,I feel that this movie is a whimsical introduction to Studio Ghibli along with Kikis Delivery Service and The Cat Returns  It tells a heartwarming story and the main characters are beyond relatable to a pair of siblings  However there is the plot point of Satsuki and Meis mother Yasuko  In the movie Yasuko has tuberculosis and when her condition becomes more critical Mei runs away from home  Some say this scene is a gives the movie a deceptive twist that scared their children and ruined the movie  You know what else is deceptive Tuberculosis terminal illness  You need to explain what is going on if your child asks and ask them if they understand  If you keep this information from them theyll learn further in the future and it would be much more traumatic  You shouldnt lie to your kids because if they wholly believe your lies youll come off as untrustworthy to your kids and it would mess them up further later  So teach your kid whats going on if they need to know  Itll work better eventually  Knowledge is power,13
151157,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,its very very very verygreat its the best movie ever,1
151194,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Very good movie for babies kids tweens teens and adults,1
151195,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Well Spirited Away it looks like youre finally off the hook I have now seen seven Hayao Miyazaki movies with widely varying degrees of enjoyment  Princess Mononoke and Porco Rosso are legitimately fantastic films animation or otherwise  Castle in the Sky is a largely enjoyable movie bogged down with a weak 3rd act and a bloated runtime  Nausica of the Valley of the Wind and Howls Moving Castle both had interesting parts but were ultimately too scattershot and tedious to be fully enjoyable  And Spirited Away was easily the most overrated and unsatisfying of the whole bunch     until I saw My Neighbor Totoro,6
151196,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This used to be my favroute movie when I was little now I still love it many of the characters are kind and warmhearted,1
151197,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This film is most defiantly one of Miyazakis best productions  A great famliy movie experience  Good for all audiences  Spectacular artwork  A beautiful film   Mostly recommended for younger kids  A must for Young anime fans,7
151198,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,I absolutely love this movie  Its a cute story with a deep meaning behind it  Once I figured out the meaning it kind of freaked me out  Still it was an amazing movie with imaginative characters and beautiful animation  Spoiler It had me thinking that the mother was about to die and I was close to crying through it thinking of what would happen if she died in the movie  It was so sad how Mei was  bringing the corn all the way just to give it to her mother  Overall its a really good movie and you should see it,7
151199,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This Movie is The 5th Miyazaki Film I Have Watched Out of 9 It Was Such a Cute Movie With an Amazing Story and Plot  With Breathtaking Animation I Think My Neighbor Totoro should be in the Top 5 Best Movies Ever Made,2
151200,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Great movie,2
151201,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This a amazing film for everyone Its funny in parts and really enjoyable  Its very creative and almost like a dream the artdrawing is very good too,3
151202,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,this movie is such a cute movie And has no bad things you have to worry about,2
151203,1889번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,I love this movie,1
151247,1891번,My Octopus Teacher,8,Beautiful docu  Thats all I can say,2
151248,1891번,My Octopus Teacher,8,Gorgeous film Really inspirational  I usually dont like documentaries Except for the Taylor Swift one of course but this one is amazing,3
151249,1891번,My Octopus Teacher,8,This is an emotional entertaining documentary about a man going through depression who visits an octopus every day and eventually befriends it  Some kids wont find it interesting enough to keep watching but older kids will likely be drawn in  Theres almost nothing wrong with this movie except the depression aspect might confuse some younger kids  Watch it,4
151250,1891번,My Octopus Teacher,8,i think the movie comes out special but for someone the movie can be boaring it got one sad part but the rest is him telling about the octopus he have seen  the movie is special and i do recommend it  wow    i learned alot,3
151251,1891번,My Octopus Teacher,8,I loved this movie It was fun and more of a documentary but overall really good  My whole family loved it and its usually very hard for us to figure out what to watch,3
151252,1891번,My Octopus Teacher,8,My octopus teacher  What a life  I mean you always hear Long live the king  But have you heard Long live the octopus Have you Ok I didnt mean to threaten you  Oh yes I did im sorry not really   Im actually very nice you know    can I break your Ps4 Sooo    I regard this movie more like a documentary  It is pretty tear jerking at most times  It looks like a 1 hour long ad but like one of the BEST ads ever you know  If your going watch this your going to want to become an  scuba diver  For real  Enjoy  Its sad  And sad  And sadder  Enjoy again  No really  What are you reading  I said go  Enjoy  Oh wait  I need to,24
151253,1891번,My Octopus Teacher,8,Great movie  For kids interested in underwater life about forests under the water learning about octopuses and how they live their life under the sea  This movie also shows about how octopuses protect themselves from enemies and has zero violence except for one sad part in the movie With sharks But aside from that the movie is really fun and really interesting and will not give any kids nightmares,3
151254,1891번,My Octopus Teacher,8,Heartfelt though you have to be pretty rich to literally do nothing but visit an octopus for a year and a half  He has a nice house on the beach front etc  Very good docco for kids,3
151255,1891번,My Octopus Teacher,8,My Octopus Teacher is a really coolamazing movie but it gets really scarysad at the end my favorite part is where the octopus got on him   My mom cried  But instead of crying I was laughing inside myself while she was crying  But overall it is a pretty good movie  It was really sweet but also stressful especially at the end like when there was a shark chasing the octopus   But watch it if you can,6
151269,1893번,My Spy,7,Theres a lot of violence just heads up theres kicking punching stabbing exploding killing throwing fire heads getting chopped off  Violence 1010 language 810 theres ss btch st dk gruesome things 610 a little gross from vomiting and blood and some mean and good messages but thats all,2
151270,1893번,My Spy,7,I loved the movie a lot Even though there were swearing  in the movie it didnt bother me  My parents let me watch this movie With them  Still its the best spy movie Ive ever seen  So Id say give the movie a shot There is violence though like punching and kicking and pushing a truck down a big clif,6
151271,1893번,My Spy,7,It was great  A couple iffy things though including how JJ threatens to kill a nine year old and said nine year old is manipulative and curses plus the overall language and violence gosh I make it sound bad but I really liked it   I feel though that if they toned it down a notch it could have been PG but oh well,3
151272,1893번,My Spy,7,Parents are overreacting about this movie  This is a spy movie and any movie that involves the government and spies and a big burly man in a serious way is not an ok way to spent your kids time  If a parent watches the trailer checks the common sense review and still thinks Oh a man gets decapitated and a kid calls an adult a dk Well Im going to 100 show that to my 9yearold Then thats just bad parenting  I get it if some parents didnt check how old you need to be to watch this movie but if you actually took the time afterward to write a review on this site and KNEW ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND then dont blame the movie for being aimed at tweens blame yourself for not reading about this movie before you show it to your kids  Again Im not blaming parents who didnt get a good opinion but really man be more careful  Im not gonna do an I hope this review helped Thing I normally do because I am writing this review at 1030 at night and I am very tired  So goodnight commonsense See ya tomorrow,9
151273,1893번,My Spy,7,This was a really fun movie  Based on the ratings I was a little worried but it was pretty good  The language wasnt the best but most mature children will be able to handle it  There is a gay couple so make sure that your kids understand that  Overall good movie,5
151274,1893번,My Spy,7,It has violence but not that that much I watched it with a friend and her younger brother it has some language but its pretty appropriate if you dont like violence dont watch it,1
151275,1893번,My Spy,7,This Movie is honestly a great one I loved seeing a big guy like Drax teaming up with a Little girl  They have shanking stabbing shooting punching and other violence but if your 1011 that wont bother you too much  There is too much swearing for a movie supposedly for 10 year olds  There is uses of Bith Sht Jesus and more but if you watch Action movies it wont be such a big deal If your 10 in my opinion it would be fine,4
151276,1893번,My Spy,7,A lot of bad language and a lot of bad fist fights that might scare your younger kids  Also some kissy stuff and flirting and gross stuff like that  Overall there are some good messages like team work and family  There are some scary weapons plus a main character throws a knife at another character and barfs on accident  Although the action might be scary it is actually super sick  Very funny Great movie,7
151663,1911번,Need for Speed,8,Not bad but pretty predictable and kinda corny at times  Aaron Pauls performance is great but overall its not the best action film out there,2
151664,1911번,Need for Speed,8,Aaron Paul is brilliant in this it was good seeing him not cooking meth with a 50 year old man lmao the movie is a fun pretty good movie I like how there is no CGI used which is great And what CSM forgot to put under positive messages is SPOILERS the bad guy manslaughters his friend and leaves him there and at the end a similar situation happens at the end with the bad guy in the car and Toby Aaron Paul takes him out of the car to make sure hes alright,3
151665,1911번,Need for Speed,8,Need for Speed the movie has to be one of the better gamebased movies out there  It has charming characters intense but mostly grounded action and some pretty great moments,2
151666,1911번,Need for Speed,8,This movie is fine for younger teens,1
151667,1911번,Need for Speed,8,It was a really good movie  Very good story the racing was amazing,2
151668,1911번,Need for Speed,8,Good car movie,1
151669,1911번,Need for Speed,8,I think this movie is recommended for a 12 but the nudity is not bad just a butt shown only,1
151670,1911번,Need for Speed,8,My ratingPG13 for intense sequences of crashes and actionsome languageracy contentand brief nudity,1
151680,1912번,Never Been Kissed,8,This movie was fantastic I loved the plot it was invigorating and engaging  Movie does include a scene that takes place in a sexed classroom diagrams are present as well as the classic bananacondom learning activity  I recommend this movie to kids 13 and older due to that one scene as well as a few sexual comments throughout the movie  Any kids younger should either watch with a parent or not watch at all but the movie has got great lessons and can teach kids some good values  There is also some mild drug taking pot brownie but its nothing serious shouldnt be a problem  Also do be aware that there is some flirtation between a teacher and an undercover student the student is actually 25 but pretending to be 17  Id make sure your child is aware that studentteacher relationships are definitely not okay because while this is a great movie its from the 90s so its a bit more lack on that kind of thing than we are today  Overall Id definitely recommend it just know your child and be ready to explain whats okay and whats not,9
151681,1912번,Never Been Kissed,8,Overall this movie didnt wow me  I definitely didnt hate it but it didnt really pack the punch i was hoping for  One of the most problematic themes is the flirting between the teacher and a perceived student  Although the student is actually an adult my mom and I were still very concerned by this,4
151682,1912번,Never Been Kissed,8,This movie was very entertaining but it has a lot of sex references  Definitely 13 or 12 with a parent,2
151683,1912번,Never Been Kissed,8,It a good movie but  there is some drinking  and sx in the movie  I think kids who are under 13 years old should watch it with a parent,3
151684,1912번,Never Been Kissed,8,This movie has a great lesson and theme and is very good  The only thing some parents might have to worry about is a few uses of drugs and two people making out,2
151685,1912번,Never Been Kissed,8,The main character goes undercover as a high school student and she and a teacher clearly both are attracted to each other even though he believes shes a student  When she announces that she is actually an adult the teacher seems really conflicted and upset  But he was fine with it when he thought she was a minor Gross,4
151686,1912번,Never Been Kissed,8,I have to say this is one of my all time favorite rom coms  Some scenes could be a lil iffy for younger viewers like when they put condoms on bananas etc  Language is mild   couple of shts once in a while  Also Micheal Varton is effing hot ,5
151687,1912번,Never Been Kissed,8,this movie was both funnyboringinappropriate and just your normal romcom     I liked it and agree that it is a must see but    i dunno     if you are looking for a really great romcom watch Love actually soooooo much better It wasnt as inappropriate as I thought it would be unlike four weddings and a funeral but it is still a bit racy   Id say watch it before you let your kids see it then decide what you think,3
151688,1912번,Never Been Kissed,8,My ratingR for mature racy content throughoutgraphic nuditydrug useand language,1

151891,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,Nobody,1
151892,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,Its a funny film with a few stereotypes about  Sacajawea and Attila the Hun also some mild peril and Larry is chased by Attila the Hun with swords two little guys crash a car into a rock and they presumably died  Also some language like kick ass hell and dum dum,2
151893,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,Pros Yay Im glad I watched this movie Now I know more about history the only 2 things I dont like are,4
151894,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,This is a really good movie  It has an awesome plot and was surprisingly based off of a childrens picture book that had less then twenty pages,2
151895,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,This movie has lots of adventure And a lot of comedy It  might be a little scary for little kids though,2
151896,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,This movie was great It was actionpacked and funny and taught you a few facts throughout history in a fun way  Definitely a mustwatch,3
151897,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,Seriously CSM Three stars This movie is so underrated  My entire family loves it  It has great characters a great plot and that twist at the end is amazing  SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT,6
151898,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,Mild infrequent swearing  A few subtextual references that would go over most kids heads  Some scenes including a scene where a wax figurine is run over and another where a mummy is unwrapped may be frightening to younger viewers,3
151899,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,this movie seems a bit scary at first for little ones but it all comes together as a really fun and hilarious movie   It is fun for all ages 7 and up,2
151900,1926번,Night at the Museum,7,Night at the Museum is not the best film but fun and good for kids  Warning the Civil war guys have masks on and may be a little creepy  This film is great but not for under seven  The old men disguise as goodies so can be quite scary,4
152450,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,I grew up watching this movie  I have lived in a very diverse area all of my life and this movie was always something  I could relate to   As a child I would get done with dinner and beg on my hands and knees to watch this movie   It got to the point that the movie just had to stay in the DVD player  I have seen a lot of bad reviews about this movie  I am wracking my brain as to why  It could be the scary themes represented but I cannot understand why it is such a big deal  A lot of movies have scary themes throughout  I also grew up loving Pocahontas and that is a terribly rated movie  If we allowed are children to watch movies with REAL LIFE SCENARIOS maybe our kids wouldnt be asshole or serial killers  Thank you very much,11
152451,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,Oliver and company was phenomenal     one of my favorite Disney movies of all time tied with the great mouse detective there are some kinda extreme scenes for little kids  one where desoto one of the evil Rottweilersgets hurt another where dodger main character puppy gets beaten up in a dog fight    and the adult human is told hes going to die if he doesnt pay his debts,1
152452,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,Love the music Oliver and Rita and dodger are my favorites Jenny is great to so is Winston and gorgette is kinda annoying bill sykes AWESOME,2
152453,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,I have LOVED this movie since I was pretty little  The plot is a little bit unoriginal and there are some bad role models Georgette is a conniving jealous diva  Fagan kidnaps a girls cherished pet kitten to pay off a debt  Dodger is kind of rude and uncaring at times but changes later  The villain in addition to being a total jerk smokes constantly But just so long as kids know not to mimic that behavior theyll be good  I think the main reason I love this movie so much is the music especially Why Should I Worry and Perfect isnt easy,6
152454,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,This movie has emotional elements including a kitten who is alone in the earlier scenes and some scary sequences including two meanacing dogs and an intenseviolent death of a certain character  There is even some mild consumerism including an image of the CocaCola logo some insults suggestive content messages and brief smoking  So its on for ages 9 iffy for ages 8 and off for ages 5,3
152455,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,Oliver and Company is an amazing movie Its so underrated everyone forgets about it but its really good  Its funny and it has good songs obviously because Billy Joel is in it it paved the way for the Disney Renaissance  which in my opinion are better than the classics Oliver and Company is not to be pushed aside,3
152456,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,Ive loved Disney films since I was born  No really  I was born in 93 and the first film I saw in a theater was The Lion King  I think of all the films I saw in the theater during the first few years of my life The Lion King and Oliver and Company hold the most special place in my heart  Ive seen TLK and other Disney classics many times over but Ive only recently rediscovered Oliver  The status of the film is a bit like its central character  this was originally a very popular film back when it was released in 1988 and even got a rerelease in 1996 where I was first exposed to its greatness but it took 7 years for it to get on home video had mostly mixedtonegative reviews and went from popular to criminally overlooked  In the 80s the dark period of Disney history Oliver and Company was the light at the end of the tunnel and it helped pave the way for the best films to come out of Disney since the Golden Age period that began with Snow White 1937 and ended with The Rescuers 1977  The Little Mermaid Beauty and the Beast Aladdin The Lion King and other films of the Disney Renaissance period the 90s were all created by the artists who started with Oliver and Company  But it doesnt give off the impression of being an experimental film it ends up being a true classic  Oliver is an orphaned kitten living on the streets of New York City  He fights to survive until he meets Dodger a dog voiced by the alwayscool Billy Joel who is initially resistant to Oliver but ends up liking him quite a bit  So much in fact that he introduces the kitten to his group of ragtag stray dogs including the dumb Einstein the smart Brit Francis the sassy Rita and the hilarious Tito  All of them help out a homeless man named Fagin who owns a large debt to a loan shark named Sykes one of the scariest villains in Disneys history  He owns two intimidating Dobermans and theyre both hostile towards Fagins gang  Then when Oliver learns how to survive hes adopted by a little rich girl named Jenny whose poodle Georgette is anything but pleased about  It all ends up becoming a tale of friendship and loyalty thats on par with anything Disney did during the Disney Renaissance  But the tone of this one is very gritty and realistic at points  a shock for Disney but still counterbalanced with happy songs and what not  For example the opening few minutes will make even the most hardhearted cry at least a little when Oliver is simply left alone in a dark and scary New York at night  But the song playing during this scene Huey Lewis Once Upon a Time in New York City is sad yet uplifting pointing towards better things that are yet to come  And that they do  The only other things to worry about are some mildly scary scenes when Jenny gets kidnapped by Sykes when the characters are threatened by Sykes Dobermans and the intense chase scene in the New York subway  Overall though CSM is wrong theyve got the same biased opinion on this as the film critics who havent appreciated it for what it is one of Disneys best classics  The music is awesome the animation is awesome the humor is awesome the voice acting is awesome   so yeah  In only a little bit over an hour Disney accomplishes more than most films of three hours can Just see this one You wont regret it,26
152457,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,If you dont know when you see Bill Sykes evil smirk with  sitting on the chair and holding his cigar that expression that looks like Shan Yu says how many men does it to deliver a message That is all I can say However Oliver And The War is the best crossover movie ever created  But I recommended for ages 18 and up because of lot of violence and Elmo is very thicc,3
152458,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,I like this movie  Its old cute got catchy music and has an interesting storyline  Alright so the interactions between two dogs was fine to a point then one wanted to talk to the other alone and he it took as    something else  The two dobbermans can seem intimidating  In conclusion a fun movie but children may need to be accompanied if they are sensitive,5
152459,1974번,Oliver & Company,8,The movie is awesome and I loved the songs streets of gold,1
152575,1990번,One Crazy Cruise,8,With only some mild teen kissing and flirting to worry about kids are perfectly fine to watch One Crazy Cruise  Expect a silly story along with messages about embracing change and coming together as a family,2
152576,1990번,One Crazy Cruise,8,This Movie is amazing Cody Simpson in this movie dating Ellie that  was how I thought it would end with a romantic ending LiarLiar Vampire was really badso after I watched it I binge watched One Crazy Cruise I saw Good Ratings on it on Imdb I wish it was on DVD So I could watch as many times I want  Nick Good Job,3
152577,1990번,One Crazy Cruise,8,It is a very nice movie one of my favorites,1
152578,1990번,One Crazy Cruise,8,My ratingPG for rude humor throughout,1
152782,1996번,Onward,6,This movie is about magic and how theres always a little magic inside you  I saw the movie on the TV and it was great  Its about 2 boys going on an adventure to try to bring their dad back in 24 hours  Theyll introduce more characters and events  There are hard obstacles they have to overcome great backup and heartful messages and not too much violence  There is some but not much  Overall this movie is great  DisneyPixar collaborations are great,8
152783,1996번,Onward,6,A really sweet story with just the right amount of adventure,1
152784,1996번,Onward,6,it was well done funny and had no language or sex  mild action  a iffy comment about a female officers girlfriend  an awesome familyfriendly flick,4
152785,1996번,Onward,6,Onward is the best movie of 2020 so far  Though the story is a bit lackluster generic rescue story they managed to make it work somehow  I almost cried 3 times which 1 time it succeeded  One time was when Ian was listening to his dad using the cassette boombox the time where I actually did cry was when Ian was sitting with dads halfbody realizing that Barley was just like a father figure to him and the last time when Barley hugged Ian at the end,4
152786,1996번,Onward,6,Its a good movie and I recommend it,1
152787,1996번,Onward,6,A lighthearted fantasy story with wonderful characters and powerful messages about family and selflessness  There is some combat but its not gory at all  I would recommend this to everyone,3
152788,1996번,Onward,6,I enjoyed Onward like I enjoyed many other Pixar films  Onward follows two boys who go on a journey to bring back their dad for a day  The stakes are high and the movie is interesting,3
152789,1996번,Onward,6,Its a mustwatch amazing movie that really surprised me  Its very heartwarming and I recommend it,2
152854,1998번,Open Season,8,Natureset animated comedy with scenes that spoof,1
152855,1998번,Open Season,8,Id recommend it  Its not every day you see computergenerated characters trampling computergenerated grass as they walk through it,2
152856,1998번,Open Season,8,Good but crude some positive messages,1
152857,1998번,Open Season,8,Unlike Tarzan 2 This film is not appropiate for ages 26 at all there is lots of profanity like Get off my tree you Fing squirrel and there is the word ass in the film but its hard to see Overall This film is not appropiate for ages 26 at all due to all of the bad language,1
152858,1998번,Open Season,8,This movie is watchable  But it has its bits of badnessbut overallthis movie is worth watching,2
152859,1998번,Open Season,8,This movie has everything the word CP fart jokes peeing jokes poop jokes horrible voice acting animation story characters everything  Pretty much this movie sucked  The only interesting part was the psychotic huntsman who has a gun and likes to go PEW PEW and tries to kill our notsobeloved heroes  For once I was on the antaganists side  This is an awful example to younger viewers  Oh DEER  See what I did there Because one of the main characters is a DEER Or DOE you not know what Im talking about ,10
152860,1998번,Open Season,8,This movie is kinda funny and I think it is a good family movie to watch  The only part that you want to know is that Shaw uses a gun to try to hunt the animals  Other than that I recommend you watch it,3
152861,1998번,Open Season,8,Personally I think it has a good story line and that little kids will laugh at the content  the only bit I may find a bit worrying is that they are being hunted and that when I was little it made me a bit afraid  It it OK though in my opinion as it ticked a lot of boxes but is was sad as the bear was separated from his mother and got PUT TO SLEEP  Be careful with your child as you would do with another p g,4
152862,1998번,Open Season,8,It was sooo boring Also one use of the C word  Im glad other users caught that  Heres the scene  Boog is sitting on some sort of haylike thing and Elliot is trying to convince him to poop  Then he says Come on start crappin   After that I changed it to The Spongebob Movie  Watch that movie instead,8
153005,2007번,"Our Friend, Martin",8,This movie was educational enough but there definitely was some iffy language   Also is this just me or did they draw a six grader like an eighteen yr old  I dunno if its just the drawing style but Maria seems a tad bit sexualized,3
153006,2007번,"Our Friend, Martin",8,There was some violence like old reallife videos of police assaulting protesters bullying and an offscreen shooting  A house is bombed as well and black kids are being called racial slurs  Along with drinking drugs and smoking a dad smokes in the car  The language is brief some mean words being called to people and a dad in a car yelling mean things to other cars in front of him,4
153007,2007번,"Our Friend, Martin",8,In some of them middle of the movie someones dad is smokeing,1
153330,2028번,Paddington,7,funny family friendly,1
153331,2028번,Paddington,7,This movie was pretty good But my 7 year old sister started freaking out at the crazy lady  She ran to the theater bathroom and stayed there for most of the duration of the movie  This was AWESOME  But the second movie was better,4
153332,2028번,Paddington,7,I really enjoyed this flimbut I think if you are under 8 you might get nightmares because theres a bit of violence in it which could scare little ones But its still a good flim,1
153333,2028번,Paddington,7,Beartastic  sorry about the pun it is amazing and heartfelt movie that has funny scenes   It is a movie that all ages can laugh at   Yes there is an evil woman that is trying to turn Paddington into a stuffed bear but there are so many other great scenes that are more memorable than that,4
153334,2028번,Paddington,7,Paddington is a fun family film at times but at other times you feel like it doesnt fit that description  I believe this is more of a scare than the sequel that came out recently  Millicent the main antagonist wants to stuff Paddington since he is part of a rare species and she wants him for her collection  This theme is believed by me to only go well with kids eight or older  There was an iffy word as well that probably isnt the best for a kidsfamily film  The word sexy is spoken in a scene where Mr  Brown dresses up as a lady  Paddington does bring a few good things like how Mr  Brown eventually got on board with the idea of having Paddington and the rest of the Brown family consider Paddington true family,7
153335,2028번,Paddington,7,This movie is really well done,2
153336,2028번,Paddington,7,PADDINGTON is a really positive movie about a family that find a bear and look after it  There may be scenes that are scary for young children but it is a very good movie,2
153337,2028번,Paddington,7,The movie kind of freaked me out and made me want to run screaming from the movie theatre,1
153338,2028번,Paddington,7,Why is it for six year olds I watched it with my little brother who is three and he seemed to like it  The best part is when Paddington did all those weird things in the bathroom,3
153339,2028번,Paddington,7,In this movie there is nothing to worry about  I just love the good messages that the all the good role models,2
153359,2028번,Paddington,7,The only parts i think were bad was when the women was flirting with the neighbor,1
153360,2028번,Paddington,7,Paddington is a great movie  The only thing I may worn is that even though Milicentnot telling who she is is not meant to be scary she may seem to be a little intence for kids younger then 8  Of course its a meant for family movie  There is nothing inapprocriate at all  This is from a kids point of view so adults may have a different opinion  Great movie overall though,6
153361,2028번,Paddington,7,I loved it  Ben Whishaw and the rest of the cast were excellent especially Whishaw as the voice of Paddington  One of the best family films I have ever seen,3
153362,2028번,Paddington,7,I think  that kids under 10 should NOT pay to watch this movie There is an evil animal and people murderer who is after Paddington mostly the whole movie  But it is still pretty sweet NO WAY so all I am trying to say is it is too violent and stressful for kids under ten,3
153363,2028번,Paddington,7,I think it is great  but there is mild violence so I rated it eight and up,1
153364,2028번,Paddington,7,Great Movie 4 Paddington rated PG 5 OF 5 STARS ON Review SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Good,2
153365,2028번,Paddington,7,Great movie funny and family friendly  A few funny references to the mission impossible series which young kids may not get  fine for children but Paddington himself is put in a lot of peril being shot at getting stuck in an incinerator and being put in a taxidermy van  The family itself has gret messages and paddington is a funny charecter their is a scene where Ms byrd is in a drinking contest and appears drunk even though they are never shown drinking alcohol  I also think your kids might be tempted to buy paddington books and stuffed animals,4
153366,2028번,Paddington,7,I think it was really good because it had lots of good messageshumor and great role models  Kids between the ages of 10  12 may not like it as much although,2
153367,2028번,Paddington,7,This movie was great What an awesome story everyone should watch this  There is some stuff sensitive parents may feel is not appropriate for younger children like the fact that the main antagonist is trying to stuff paddington  But nothing violent is shown so its fine for ages 6 and up and iffy for ages 5 and under,4
153368,2028번,Paddington,7,Funny funny funny  Cant escape from funnyland  When Paddington went on his bathtub boat was my favorite part,3
153454,2038번,Paper Planes,7,Can be a bit sad but it is good,1
153455,2038번,Paper Planes,7,Paper planes is a really good film but its sad at times  Kimi and Dylan pretty nice,2
153456,2038번,Paper Planes,7,Pretty cool,1
153457,2038번,Paper Planes,7,paper planes is the best movie ever,2
153458,2038번,Paper Planes,7,The movie is ok but a bit with acupuncture might be scary for young kids  There isnt any blood,2
153459,2038번,Paper Planes,7,PAPER PLANES is nearly overflowed with positive messages  I think it is a great film for families,2
153460,2038번,Paper Planes,7,Im using this film for a film study at school so I watched the movie for the first time not some thing I usually watch but surprisingly overall I loved this movie now one of my favourite movies it show cases that bullys can turn into friends and your family can be once again your rock if you give them time to heal from their scares,1
153461,2038번,Paper Planes,7,Its amazing but it is  sad in some parts  Its inspired  me to make my own paper planes and to give things a go,2
154069,2060번,Pearl Harbor,8,The movie is fantastic It portrayed Pearl Harbor and what people may have thought during the attack perfectly  I recommend But watch out when watching with younger kids There is language and lots of violence but still a fantastic movie,6
154070,2060번,Pearl Harbor,8,War in Hawaii that Japanese were attacking,1
154071,2060번,Pearl Harbor,8,Good war movie,1
154072,2060번,Pearl Harbor,8,This movie is recommended for a 12,1
154073,2060번,Pearl Harbor,8,Its a Michael bay movie so its really bad,1
154074,2060번,Pearl Harbor,8,I have no idea why people say this movie is bad like on imdb they gave it a 6 1 which is a d I mean come on yes the story is fake but well acted and interesting some language I believe ther is at least one f word and possibly 2 but very good movie,1
154075,2060번,Pearl Harbor,8,25 on Rotten Tomatoes is still too good of a review for this movie  I wasnt even paying attention to it writing on my computer while it was playing in the same room and I was so distressed by the  utter cheesiness of it that I had to leave the room,2
154076,2060번,Pearl Harbor,8,My ratingR for strong brutal war violence throughout language throughout and brief sexuality,1
154458,2092번,Pitch Perfect,8,This is a great musical movie  I know people as young as 7 watch this but I think waiting till 13 is a better idea,2
154459,2092번,Pitch Perfect,8,Pitch Perfect is a great movie that cuts right to the heart but it also has a lot of swearing consumerism and a bit of sex  Very good messages about never giving up  but kids under 11  might want to think twice about it,2
154460,2092번,Pitch Perfect,8,Enough said,1
154461,2092번,Pitch Perfect,8,This movie has to be my favorite movie of all time  I have seen it over 10 times and it never gets old   The singing and acting is amazing and the movie is over all hilarious,3
154462,2092번,Pitch Perfect,8,I loved this movie so much I watched it in the plane and I needed up laughing out loud at so many parts  I feel like the other passengers on the plane thought I was a little weird  The music and dancing is also really amazing  It makes me just want to get up and start grooving   I defiantly recommend this movie for teens,6
154463,2092번,Pitch Perfect,8,I am 13 and I loved this movie you have to be kinda mature to  see it there is some language issues but it didnt bother me any   There is at least 2 or 3 scenes were she throws up  But again that didnt bother me  I absolutely loved it and think other kids my age would to,4
154464,2092번,Pitch Perfect,8,This movie is halarious and great for a mature 11 year old  Some inappropriate things were said like bich and sit  In the beginning a girl introduce herself to Becca the main character and tells her where her room and gives her a whistle and says This is your official Bardon university rapist whistle  Do blow it unless its really happening  Also there were a bunch of college kids at a party drinking and one girl says that she needs her jiggle juice  One girl admits to having lots of sx  One point in an a cepella riff offa battle between a Capella groups they have categories and one of them was songs about sx and then they started singing about it  That was a little awkward when watching it  Overallthis movie was entertaining and fun to watch other than the bad stuff  I loved it and Im still waiting to see the second one,10
154465,2092번,Pitch Perfect,8,This movie fallows Beca a girl in collage who is a DJ  At the school there a five acapella groups and one of then is the Barden Bellas the best acapella group there is the troubles  Then beca gets invited to join the Bellas after they lost a conniption because on of the Bellas threw up on everyone  So then Beca decideds to join and try to them good again  This movie is extremely vulgar and racy there is tons of gay and lesbian jokes implied racy content a scene in a show with breasts visible extremely crass and explicit references about racy content some kissing and some inappropriate gestures  There is also tons of constant vulgar language including 30 uses of st fk sltbags dk py ps  etc  There is lots of underage drinking partying and drug use throughout  There is no violence at all but its suspenseful if ether going to win or not  This movie is fantastic amazing hilarious fun and enjoyable but to racy for teens  My ratingR for strong racy contentnudity throughout pervasive language graphic nudity strong alcohol and drug use and vulgar references,10
154633,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Great comedy has only one bad scene when a man says the FWord about 30 times in a row  The rest is either a light PG13 or a strong PG,2
154634,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Good but smoking and language,1
154635,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Although this movie  has an iconic tirade with fk repeatedly just about everything else is PGappropriate  It is a great thanksgiving movie for somewhat older kids and a very funny movie anytime,2
154636,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Funny comedy just has a brief scene of strong language okay for kids 11 and up,1
154637,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,One of the best comedies,1
154638,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Planes  trains and automobiles is a funny yet sad comedy about two strangers whos flight is delayed and they share a room together and go on an adventure  Ther is a scene with a lot of uses of the f word and more language   through the whole movie  It is not sexual or crude  Must watch,4
154639,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Sure theres some bad language but its not horrible and its very funny and great for kids 10 if you are younger than 10 I recommend you have a parent approval  Enjoy the movie,2
154640,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,As far as I can say this is a very good movie although I did see some adultish jokes I think this is perfectly suitable for kids 13,1
154641,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Honestly this movie is fine for 13 year olds if you skip the scene in which Steve Martin uses the dreaded Fbomb  this actually would have been a pg movie if they would have removed this scene  The only major issue here is the language,3
154642,2096번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,I like how two friends stay together to get to the guys house  It shows how you should stay together no matter what  Thats just what you do,3
154767,2107번,Poltergeist,7,This movie is good but has a one minute sequence of flashing lights in the beginning and a really long sequence of flashing lights 1520 minutes near the end  So this movie contains a lot of sequences of flashing lights that may affect viewers with epilepsy or any other photosensitivity,2
154768,2107번,Poltergeist,7,I think this movie is great for youngsters who like scarygory stuff,1
154769,2107번,Poltergeist,7,Poltergeist has not aged well  It also isnt that scary  The tree coming to life and the goofy clown doll dont just scare like they should  Some scenes work well though  The nightmarish scene when the man tears his face in the mirror is truly great stuff  Overall though not particularly frightening,6
154770,2107번,Poltergeist,7,If you can watch Harry Potter it is fine for you,1
154771,2107번,Poltergeist,7,Aside from the face peeling scene  in which the effects are quite outdated  this movie has no blood and gore and leaves the scares to the supernatural happenings throughout the film  It is definitely not however for any kids under 1011 as it brings the kids beloved toy into the evil action with the  already creepy  toy clown  It is scary but the parents set great examples because they are very committed to saving their family  A few swear words are included but overall there isnt too much profanity,4
154772,2107번,Poltergeist,7,This is the cheesiest trippiest ghost film ever   I know it was original when it came out but now everything in it is clich and poorly executed compared to its followers  A small amount of violence and the parents do drugs but nothing much else inappropriate  Dont watch this film for entertainment  I guess its worth watching if you want to see the inspiration behind better ghost films such as insidious and the conjuring  25 stars,6
154773,2107번,Poltergeist,7,Poltergeist is a family horror movie that is fairly scary  The violence isnt too bad but in one particularly gross scene a man rips his face off and reveals his bloody skull  The scene is in the mans head which could make it a little less frightening  The family is fearless and strong in the face of danger and will stop at nothing to bring back their daughter from the Other Side  They can teach kids to always work for what you want and dont give up  The swearing is fairly moderate with a few cases of btch st damn and hell  Overall this movie should be suitable for a 10 yo child,7
154774,2107번,Poltergeist,7,Steven Spielberg classic   Good but scary,2
154968,2111번,Ponyo,6,I just watched this movie with my little sister today  We both loved it and Im 14 It was really cute and I love Miyazakis movies  Studio Ghiblis artwork and animation is beautiful and amazing  Even if you think youre too old for it go see it anyway you wont be disappointed,5
154969,2111번,Ponyo,6,This Movie is My Fav Movie Ever It Made Me Love Anime Now I Watch Fruits Basket Toradora and Other Animes all Because of This Movie and I Watched When I Was 6 and Became an Instant Miyazaki Fan  I Really Love This Movie,3
154970,2111번,Ponyo,6,A great movie Mostly for younger kids but your older ids can still watch it and I dont now how they couldnt love it,2
154971,2111번,Ponyo,6,I am a huge fan of Studio Ghiblis films  The animation is fantastic and the plot is very cute  I dont know why people are having a cow over the breastfeeding line though because THATS WHAT THEYRE FOR  Its better for kids to learn here instead of school right Anyways yeah I love all of Mizayakis works and this is definatley a good movie,5
154972,2111번,Ponyo,6,Firstly let me get one thing clear this wasnt a bad film  I actually think its a good opportunity for family members to come together and watch a friendly film with the kids  Its cute and strange definitely  visually breathtaking  These are all very good things that keep kids enlightened and entertained But for the most part Ponyo is simply a story about a little fish girl who falls in love with a human boy and they spend the entire movie acting cute while the world ends  There are two points I need to address here one being the storyline is just fine for kids but for adults it could get boring  I mean all it really is is this adorable fiveyearold love story which to be honest with you isnt overwhelming  But what about the world ending you ask isnt that overwhelming That is what I am going to address in my second point  The whole issue with the world ending I think that was just Hayao Miyazakis attempt to throw some massive adventure in there and to tell you the truth I think he COULD have done better  The end of the world as we all now is a major deal  However the people in the movie treat it as a minor inconvenience as if they hadnt just lost all their homes and possessions  Also nobody even questions why all this is happening or why there are frightening ancient fish underwater  They simply go along with it which I gotta say is the very thing that makes this movie underwhelming  Its underwhelming people put in and overwhelming situation and when that happens you KNOW the situation is going to be a whole lot more bland than before  So in itself Ponyo is a memorable film mostly for its quirkiness and nonstop adorableness  Seriously the cutsey moments in this movie are too much to bare  This paired with the fantastic animation is why most people tend to see Ponyo as a masterpiece  With all this in mind Pony now seems a bit overrated to me  I mean sure its a pretty good movie except for the story and it did its job well as a kids film  But theres allot of waiting and once I saw Ponyo the second time I fell asleep halfway through  Some things parents need to know This movie is perfect for kids  Its not scary or spooky its just different and strange but sometimes people mix up the two  Ponyo is a good film for all ages Most of the time,24
154973,2111번,Ponyo,6,I love this movie to death I remember going to theaters watching this with my mom in the summer time  This is a great movie for little kids but they might get a funny feeling watching the kind of animation  I suggest this for 9yrs and up but you can let your children watch it  When I was 5 I liked anime a little bit  But now Im a lover of anime Watch this with your kids its a must see In the summer time when it is raining outside I go watch some anime movies or some shows and if my big brother isnt busyhe watches anime too  Me and my brother are freaks of anime movies and shows  Try and do that with your family,10
154974,2111번,Ponyo,6,great movie,1
155226,2133번,Princess Mononoke,8,I would say that the creepiest things in the movie were the demons  both were covered in wormssnakes  there is lots of violence even though the main character kind of uses violence as a last resort  2 peoples heads are shot off of their bodys using arrows  and there is lots of blood  there is some profanity I completely loved the movie,6
155227,2133번,Princess Mononoke,8,Beauty meets violence in this gorgeously crafted anime movie  Ashitaka is a young prince in a faroff village protecting his people with his life along with his trusty elk Yakul  When he is inflicted with a terrible demons curse he sets out on an epic adventure to find his true self lift the curse and save the forest  But into his midst comes a mysterious princess known as Princess Mononoke  This is probably one of Hayao Miyazakis greatest  and more violent  movies  The animation is absolutely breathtaking Miyazaki can craft anything from an agile red elk to a sparkling tranquil forest to a demongod larger than an elephant  But watch out for graphic violence  SPOILER ALERTS At the beginning of the movie Ashitaka and his friend are attacked by a horrible demon that appears to be a boar covered in swirling worms  When Ashitaka kills it the flesh disappears from its body and the bloody skeleton is left behind  However Ashitaka is left with a steaming wound that the elders say is destined to kill him  Kids might be upset when Ashitaka has to leave the only home hes ever known to lift the curse upon him  At another village Ashitaka witnesses a bloody massacre in which his wounded arm swells and seems to has a mind of its own it causes him to accidentally cut off someones arms and another persons entire head  In a heavy rainstorm Lady Eboshi and her men fight a wolf one person shoots the wolf and sets it on fire briefly and it falls off a cliff  Later we see Princess Mononoke usually called San come into the story for the first time she finds the old wolf on the banks of a river and she sucks and spits out the blood from the wolfs bullet wound her mouth becomes covered in blood  After Ashitaka arrives in Irontown the central village of the story San attacks the citizens of Irontown along with her two wolfs there is a sword fight between San Ashitaka and Lady Eboshi  When Ashitaka knocks Lady Eboshi unconscious he is shot through the stomach but continues to advance through the village without any apparent struggle  An ancient boar called Okkoto becomes covered in the same swirling worms as the boar at the beginning of the movie and San becomes trapped within the worms on his face Okkoto appears to become a demon and San almost becomes one too  One of the main conflicts of the story is based on the keeping of the peace between the humans and the forest  However not all want it to be that way  Lady Eboshi strives to kill the Forest Spirit and give the head of the creature to a man named Jigo who says he will help her people in return  She succeeds in cutting off the head of the spirit of the forest the rest of the spirits body turns into a creature made of dark lifelike ooze that kills a living thing instantly upon contact  Lady Eboshis arm is then bitten off by a wolf  These are just a portion of the many violent scenes of this movie all of which are fairly bloody and gory but are still amazing and entrancing to watch  Language includes damn piss and bastard but there is really no sex  For those who are afraid of blood or watching peoples limbs get ripped from their bodies this will be too scary andor violent  But for those who are huge Miyazaki fans and are okay with the violence bloody and all it will be an actionpacked joyride that they wont soon forget,26
155228,2133번,Princess Mononoke,8,OK first off this movie is violent  People are killed and peoples limbs fall off  The PG13 rating is right,3
155229,2133번,Princess Mononoke,8,What you need to know is I hate gory movies although this movie did have some gore All the violence in the beginning is pretty quick and at some parts comical  near the end it gets pretty gory but is still manageable  There are a lot of people on hear saying they showed it to their six year old Its rated pg13 so you dont show it to youngsters I mean really cmon people the front has a picture of a girl with blood on her face and guy with a sword and scar  If you cannot handle gore whatsoever dont watch this  If you can handle some and not get scared watch it right now it is so good,5
155230,2133번,Princess Mononoke,8,It is violent but not too violent  when i first watched it i was 8 and i loved it,2
155231,2133번,Princess Mononoke,8,An absolutely amazing movie with intense action fair amounts of blood an amazing soundtrack and an amazing story that you wont forget anytime soon  This movie is amazing and a great choice for families that enjoy Japanese movies and anime,2
155232,2133번,Princess Mononoke,8,The animation and story is very unique and focuses on the story of a teenage boy trying to lift a curse caused by a hateful demon  It discusses how violence and hatred brings trouble to people and how humans are destroying the environment with their greed  A more mature and significantly better animated Fern Gully  I would NOT recommend this to anyone who doesnt like blood or body gore there is only 23 scenes with this but I found it uncomfortable to watch  I also noticed a few cuss words ass a few times damn 34 times and bastard once,5
155233,2133번,Princess Mononoke,8,This is the sequel to the 1995s hit The Flying Castle but this 1 adds more gory violence and graphic killing with lots of gore  This drama has tons of bloodygraphicdisturbing and shocking violence characters are slicedstabbedshotblown to bits etc  There are also lots of gory images including a girl eating a wolf and spitting the blood from her mouthblood is seen splatteringlots of pools blood and some very graphic woundssome disturbing and very gory content  There is no swearing or racy content but there is some drinking and flirting  This sequel is epic and very thrilling but due to strong bloody violence its and iffy choice for teens  My ratingR for bloody and graphic violence throughoutdisturbing contentimagesand intense sequences of gruesome and bloody images,6
155855,2147번,Pulp Fiction,7,The worst part about it is how much it swears particularly the f word  Unlike most of Quentin Tarantinos other films Pulp Fiction is not very violent  It has a bit of blood and a few shootings  This is definitely my favourite film by Tarantino if not my favourite of all time  A must watch for mature people aged 13 and up,5
155856,2147번,Pulp Fiction,7,Im 14 and this is my favourite movie of all time  The acting is great the violence is brutal and the screenplay is legendary  Everybody should see this movie,4
155857,2147번,Pulp Fiction,7,Pulp Fiction is one of Tarantinos greatest films making great use of the film and using it to tell a brilliant story  However after all this is a Tarantino film with extreme violence sex and language  Children shouldnt have access to this film anyway and for teenagers it depends on their maturity  Pulp Fiction is a really good film aided by perfect storytelling but contains mainly A LOT of violence,4
155858,2147번,Pulp Fiction,7,Many people consider Pulp Fiction to be Quentin Tarantinos greatest film and thats hard to argue  Included are some of his best characters dialogue and music  The film follows three stories of two hit men reclaiming their bosss briefcase one of them later taking the bosss wife to dinner and a boxer in a fixed fight who goes on the run after winning the fight  One of the funniest movies of all time and one of the best written Pulp Fiction is a knockout film recommended for mature teens with a dark sense of humor,4
155859,2147번,Pulp Fiction,7,Its a Tarantino movie so you know what to expect violence drug use gore etc   My friend recommended me this movie about a month ago and I have to say I was skeptic at first but when I saw this movie goddamn You have to watch this its one of the best movies out there,3
155860,2147번,Pulp Fiction,7,Watching this movie is really a kidbykid thing  I watched it at age 14 but if your child is uncomfortable watching violence and hearing swear words or you are uncomfortable with it maybe this movie isnt for them  There are some eye covering moments  It is a very clever film that everyone should watch in their lifetime,4
155861,2147번,Pulp Fiction,7,I watched this with my roommate Toby and we thought it was great   Nothing is real   I know a place where we can go together   Do you hear me Allison  Could you ever   I know you didnt like it here but this is too far   Theyre telling me to pull the plug   Can you hear,8
155862,2147번,Pulp Fiction,7,This is without doubt Tarantinos best film I have seen almost all of his movies and this is the one that sticks out in my memory  Almost every line in the movie makes for a great quote  One of John Travoltas best films and Samuel L  Jackson is excellent as always  There is however a good deal of violence  Lots of blood and gore a couple very violent scenes are set in a very humorous tone  Man accidentally shot in the face sets off comedic dialogue  There is a torture scene a man is slashed by a katana a man is shot in the private area another person is shot in the leg a guy gets run over by a car etc    etc    As for langauge    Well this movie actually set the record for the most uses of the Fword in a single film  271 to be exact also quite a few racial slurs as well as other various assorted cussing  Also there is some sexual content implied oral sex appears off screen a man is briefly shown being raped    etc    Yet another major factor would be the drug use many characters shoot up with heroin one girl overdoses main characters use drugs like some would take aspirin,10
155863,2147번,Pulp Fiction,7,This movie is violent but funny IF your teens want to watch it consider talking to them that this movie can be very funny but violent commonsensemedia says its not for kids but when theyre like 1215 i guess you could start saying that they can watch it but if they are scared turn it off immediately so you could give them a restriction so until theyre 18 they can watch it but you dont generally need to do it im just saying that thats good  because this movie generally makes it not for kids to get money and stuff like that only just because they want to make money for adults dosent mean that you cant give it for kids under 18 and because of that never mind the violence and sex so like give them a huge educational value so inorder to watch it,1
155913,2149번,Puss in Boots,7,Its a swashbuckling adventure that features the irresistible warrior cat,1
155914,2149번,Puss in Boots,7,It is hilarious but has some rude humor that adults will get but not little kids  It has some suitable lessons like trust and the bond between friends  My family enjoys it every time but personally I think it is best if whoever is watching it is at least 7 or 8,3
155915,2149번,Puss in Boots,7,This show is very good but I think the death character in this movie is too scary,1
155916,2149번,Puss in Boots,7,I loved everything about the movie most movies have a pros and cons list but I cant think of anything negative to say about this The pacing was good the villan atchually scared me and the story was easy to understand I didnt come out of the theater with questions as usual  I am putting 5 and up because they do reference curse words by bleeping the characters and cutting to another scene,5
155917,2149번,Puss in Boots,7,Funny sweethearted take on classic hero,1
155918,2149번,Puss in Boots,7,I have seen the 2011 SpinOff and it is one of my favorite DreamWorks SpinOffs next to Penguins Of Madagascar Guys its Puss In Boots thats the way he is you watched Shrek and it was inappropriate and Puss In Boots is a part of the Shrek Franchise,1
155919,2149번,Puss in Boots,7,Contains cartoonish fantasy violence throughout not many sexual content apart from Puss being coo over his flirtatious sidekick little to no profanity  There is a gag about how catnip mimics marijuana and how it cures Puss glaucoma,2
155920,2149번,Puss in Boots,7,Wella movie about Puss in Boots  It doesnt work 100with the wrting being somewhat weak and the new characters unmemorablebut at least Antonito reprises his role and the animation is good,2
155921,2149번,Puss in Boots,7,This movie should always have a five star rating   Its awesome Many people may like it,3
156138,2173번,Raggs,8,I agree with everyone else  The 2001 version of this show is classic  This modern version is garbage,3
156139,2173번,Raggs,8,This show ruined my childhood  The original which came out in 2001 NOT the 90s as some parents have claimed was waaaay better than this pile of garbage  The Raggs band started in 1990 which is probably why they think the original show started then  The show didnt exist till 2001  Anyways the original show was much better  The dogs were cuter the music was more fun the dogs interacted with humans their voices were much better than the poor voice acting done here and most importantly NO DUMPSTER I cannot believe they went and ruined a perfect show  Ugh just watch the original series instead of this pile of trash,8
156140,2173번,Raggs,8,This show is just a ripoff of 321 Contact  Watch the Doodlebops instead,2
156141,2173번,Raggs,8,One episode had Razzles cry over a hat and its not even funny,1
156142,2173번,Raggs,8,The music is great but the costumes scared me as a kid,1

156224,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,i love it ,1
156225,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,Slighty swearing no nudity slighty violence but too much consumerism theres fortniteinstagram ebay youtube GTA disney DC Marvel and more Great role models,2
156226,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,I think this movie is very creative and good for younger kids   but its kind of cheesy for older kids,2
156227,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,Disney has out done itself by going out to explore the internet world This is an amazing sequel although I prefer it to be watched by kids 10 and above due to high violence and the internet has some crazy stuff not for kids  It also depicts the strength of friendship,3
156228,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,AWESOME NEED TO WATCH,1
156229,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,Ralph Breaks The Internet has quite a bit of consumerism and most people wont leave without knowing the name of one of the companies shown in the film   While traveling into the Dark Web we do encounter many scary viruses and glitches though    The movie is still okay for young audiences though,3
156230,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,The movie itself was pretty solid with it emphasizing about tech today and using terms and and tips to help kids today use the internet  The thing is that the plot is confusing  SPOILERS AHEAD,4
156231,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,Sequels are supposed to be more mature and darker but this film  Its more friendlier and better  I love how every single moment of this movie especially when they reach the internet because almost everything they saw in the internet was real except that Google was Mr Knowsmore and Buzzztube was YouTube  I 100 recommend to everyone except preschooler because this movie has a lot of very mild swearing and the virus scene is very scary for younger or sensetive kids  Look I watched this when I was 11 I was still scared when Ralph became a virus  So dont worry,6
156232,2178번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,really good,1
156359,2179번,Rango,7,I really liked this movie  My 13 year old brother 8 year old sister my mom and I all watched this movie together  My brother said it was okay my sister kept on asking me what was going on though she also really liked it  however my mom and I were very happy with everything,3
156360,2179번,Rango,7,I watched this movie with my little brothers one 9 and the other   4  I wish they werent there  Good thing they dont understand movies like this  Here,4
156361,2179번,Rango,7,This is one of the most suckish movies ive ever seen My sisters LOVED it but I was bored to death,2
156362,2179번,Rango,7,dont watch itbad movieit swearshas sexual stuffand consumerismand drinking horrible choice awful,2
156363,2179번,Rango,7,This movie is terrible with its foul language and its blasphemous religious act towards something  Dont see it  Not even without your kids  Its a waste of time,4
156364,2179번,Rango,7,I think that Rango is a  perfect movie for the younger kids  It also has a positive message It is a powerful story  Also there is nothing that could possibly wrong with this movie  The names are creative all the way to the characters,5
156365,2179번,Rango,7,Great movie a really good take on westerns  There was a good deal of language stuff like dn hell and even bch which is not heard over the cry of a hawk  A lot of shooting and guns which is typical of a western and when Rango walks into the saloon there is smoking drinking and card playing going on  Plenty of humor though not all of it is for younger kids  Some kissing  Overall plenty of fun but best for ages 8 and up,6
156366,2179번,Rango,7,Ok when the trailers first came on TV I was like Oh I want to see that movie But my mom didnt but she got me the DVD because it was about a LIZARD  It does not matter if the movies about an animal I watched it with my 16year old cousin and we were BOTH terrified I was screaming and I had to hold a stuffed animal  My cousin was vomiting  And the Indian scene I feel sorry for my Grandma who is half Native American Then me and my cousin burned the DVD And threw the DVD case onto the road  I explained to my parents and now They will never let me watch Rango again  Stay FAR away from this movie,11
156367,2179번,Rango,7,Many reviews say Not for kids or 13 Im 14 and this movie was really bad You might like it if you are into animation or like western style but I truely hated it  The only good thing about this movie was that Johnny Depp stared in it  5 stars for Johnny Depp and a great big Boo to the film makers  Horrible job advertising this movie on childrens T V stations and then flipping it around to be for adults  Teens hated it    Children cant watch it    So why exactly is an animation about a lizard who swears supposed to be for any teen adult or child NOT recommended,9
156368,2179번,Rango,7,I loved this movie   I think other  people should see it,2
156493,2181번,Ratatouille,6,Cute rat tale has some peril and potentially scary moments,1
156494,2181번,Ratatouille,6,Some people might say that the characters in Ratatouille are unrealistic but actually the characters include a lot of true and dramatic character traits like rudeness and jealousy  Not only are the traits in the characters is fabulous but also the storyline is great  The story started out with the main character introducing himself to us then as the rat family got exposed they were forced to the drain which led them to Paris  In Paris he succeeded in his dreams  I like how the story included the dish Occitan Occitan is a French Provenal dish of stewed vegetables  About the theme main lesson in a story there was a man that kept jumping out to tell the rat not to give up or stop his dreams  For example sometimes in life risking your dreams or doing something unexpected can lead to a successful ending,7
156495,2181번,Ratatouille,6,I  pirated this movie and still want a refund,1

156500,2181번,Ratatouille,6,I was watching this movie and it was fine until I heard someone say Ratatooing here and also one problem is that theres no Mickey Mouse here  Education Value has none there is a some drinking and it says Ratatooing a lot  It catches Atai Omurzakov dancer man as WALLE  And yeah I recommend for 22,3
156727,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,i love this movie every time i watch i i pick up on something new that just adds to the story and makes it so much better and its so interesting,1
156728,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,so let me get this out first  I couldnt really focus on the movie so my review might have mistakes,2
156729,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Its fine  Nothing I personally enjoyed  The animation and voice acting do make it bearable  Its not the best of Disneys animated movies but its perfectly serviceable family entertainment  I didnt have that much interest in it but Im sure others will,5
156730,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Raya and the Last Dragon was another fun heroine movie from Disney I liked it but Raya looks just like Moana and the storyline is kind of like it too  Overall its worth it to watch it though  I think kids 67 and up are totally ok to watch it,4
156731,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Good ol movie  Has good action scenes and messages but heres a quick tip for parents Sometimes they imply swear words like a and b,2
156732,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,I dont want to pay 30 plus my existing Disney Plus subscription  Aquafina is awful and so is her design  It looks like a 4 year old picked up crayons and drew her mom a blue dragon  I dont understand how Disney went from Moana to Rays and the last dragon  It is unfunny and cringe worthy  I dont know why this film attempts to immerse you in the time period when you have Aquafina making a joke about being in a school project  Why was this in the movie Maybe she is a time traveler like the genie  I normally dont get this mad over Disney movies but I am mad  I payed 30 dollars and wished I got that money back  I dont underestimate Disneys talent because this movie is gorgeous but that doesnt fix the multiple problems  Im sorry Disney but you need to get your act together  There is a positive message hidden behind the lackluster jokes but it is covered in Disneys blockbuster coat,13
156733,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Positive messages a bit tense at moments,1
156734,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Raya and the Last Dragon is a great film  I really hoped this film could live up to my expectations and for the most part it did  It feels pretty good to have a good Disney film again considering I hadnt loved some of their newest films  Im not sure if its worth 30 to watch it on Disney but the decision is up to you,4
156735,2183번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,this movie is such a good family movie  People get turned into statues by an evil spirit thing but thats as bad as it gets  it is very funny there is some fighting there is no swearing and the main charicters are great role models,3

158499,2315번,Scooby-Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur,6,Amazing,1
158500,2315번,Scooby-Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur,6,I think this was too scary for younger kids   A good movie for tweens but nothing younger,2
158949,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,Its appropriate I liked how it included Rich Brian and 88 rising,1
158950,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,This was a great way to get back to theaters  This movie lived up to my expectations  The whole time my heart was racing it could have been the butter on my popcorn but that doesnt matter  The fight choreography is stunning the writing is fine as wine in the summertime  The costumes are to the nine and the visual effects are breathtaking  I highly recommend this movie,6
158951,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,great fight scenes and amazing cgi safe for most kids and even toddlers to watch,1
158952,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,very good movie with good messages and themes  super funny movie that the whole family should enjoy,3
158953,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,There is some language a few uses of st and one mouthing of fk  Lots of martial arts violence  Cast is mainly Asian  Movie has great messages,4
158954,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,Parents in my opinion the only thing you really need to worry about is when someone  says the v word once  However this is only based on your childs maturity,2
158955,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,I think kids should see this to know that there are all sorts of heroes not only white americans  Great ChineseAmerican tale amazing storyline and phenominal graphics  A joke about a ladys genitals and BS jacka sht hell damn and btch were repeated a lot throughout the movie so watch out for that  Amazing messages but a lot of violence and gore  A man was kicked in the testicles once  Otherwise amazing,6
158956,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,VIOLENCE Shangs father built quite a reputation after his wife died by killing those responsible  But it didnt end there  He continued his brutal behavior for another 10 years before his wife started calling to him asking him to safe her  Spoilers The voice was not his wife but a mimic created by the ancient beast called the Dweller  Similar creatures end up attacking a village sucking the souls from its occupants  To describe the process the creatures grab the victim and absorb a glowing orb from their body their soul  Other fighting sequences in the movie are mainly martial arts  People are stabbed punched and kicked in all sorts of ways  Some assassins fall from tall scaffolding and some fall off cliffs,9
158957,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,I loved this movie It got a little confusing at the end but it was still amazing  It was also very funny   If you are worried about inappropriate stuff the girl Katy references vagina 2 times    when they are talking abt childbirth and abt changing names normal name Gina to slang gina I love this movie though,6
158958,2358번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,SHANG CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS  The movie was EXCELLENT and for me i am a huge huge huge MARVEL fan and for me it is on of the best some languege Like S and B and stuff like that violence is average for 10 and over either then that you should approve to watch the movie GREAT MOVIE,2
159058,2361번,Sharknado,8,I think Sharknado is an awesome movie but there is a lot of vilonse and suffering between character  There is also a few kissing sense  Also the language is very harsh  Other than that Sharknado is a great movie There is also a great role model,5
159059,2361번,Sharknado,8,This is a great BMovie for ages 10 and up  The whole plot of the movie is laughing as people are killed by sharks that fall out of the sky but its so bad that its good  The only thing to worry about is violence and gore which looks like a video game  So if your kids can handle Call of Duty theyll be fine  This movie is great for a movie night,5
159060,2361번,Sharknado,8,This movie is so funny It is literally the worst movie I have ever seen which makes it that much better You should watch it Sharks start swarming in a hurricane and rain down on people  Everything is fake and really hilarious  The main characters are comical and sometimes a little stupid  A lot gets destroyed and a few people die  But its obviously fake so it will not scare most people  However dont show it to your little kids,9
159061,2361번,Sharknado,8,This movie interested me because I like shark stuff  There is plenty of violence in this movie  Sharks eating people or even just biting off their legs or their arms  There is a tornado with sharks inside and they have to find a way to survive  A girl is inside a shark and it shows you a man cutting the shark and taking her out of it  There is no sex besides kissing and the language is not strong  People say shit and hell and that is all  There is some drinking in this movie but you should not be worried about that  Nothing happens after they drink they do not get drunk or anything like that  I think that this movie is okay for kids ages 14 and up because most of the deaths are gruesome  WATCH IT IF YOU ARE 14 AND OLDER THOUGH BECAUSE IT IS AN AMAZING MOVIE,11
159062,2361번,Sharknado,8,This movie is amazing  There is a lot of blood and I mean a lot  But the blood looks fake   Their is some bad language but I think that a twelve year old kid should be allowed to watch it  The effects are not well done at all  If they were that would be a different story,6
159063,2361번,Sharknado,8,I hate this movie sooooooooooooooooooooooooo much I love it   Amazing  So funny  With the scene with the school bus look at the name on the side of the bus,4
159064,2361번,Sharknado,8,My ratingNC17 for extreme goreextreme bloodextreme violenceand some sexual content,1
159275,2366번,Shazam!,8,good movie one of dcs best,1
159276,2366번,Shazam!,8,watch with friends and family,1
159277,2366번,Shazam!,8,Shazam is great Ive seen the movie so many times and each time I love it just the same  Newcomers and fans of the DCEU will have loads to appreciate and the movie is certainly more entertaining for families  However the film is a bit more dark and scary than parents may have anticipated,5
159278,2366번,Shazam!,8,this movie is pretty darn tame compared to something like suicide squad  yet kids still watched that people are overreacting its a good movie,3
159279,2366번,Shazam!,8,Shazam is a DC film about a boy named Billy who keeps on running away from foster care in search of his birth mom  Billy is then put into another home where he meets his halfbrotherbest friend Freddy  He later meets a wizard who grants him powers by just saying one word Shazam Parents might want to be aware that there is moderate violence in this film including a very distressing scene where a boy cant find his mum and gets lost in the crowd  Luckily police help him  A mans eye contains the seven sins which could easily disturb younger children  A seventh sin bites a mans head off and throws him out a window  No blood  The villain could scare some viewers  A monster attacks a guy in a wheelchair as the doors close  Shazam is thrown onto a car and he has blood on his nose  In addition to violence look out for some moderate coarse language including s t middle finger gestures d k a man swears on TV but it is bleeped out and easy to tell he was saying f k  No sex in this movie but Billy drinks some beer and quickly spits it out  This should be fine for kids 10,13
159280,2366번,Shazam!,8,This is by far the best DCEU film to come out since Wonder Woman  Although not as dark as Wonder Woman this movie does has it darker moments  Some scenes that has violence in it may seem too shocking since some of it comes out of nowhere  But it keeps a wonderful light hearted tone with some emotional elements in the film too  Zachery Levi was comedy gold in this film and definitely stole the show  The other actors as well particularly Darla the little girl definitely didnt be reduced to the cutting room floor and had enough screen time  Most if not all the humor stuck the landing for me and even the heartwarming moments worked SO well for me and didnt seem too melodramatic  Zachery Levi and Mark Strong had excellent classic super hero vs bad guy chemistry and didnt seem too forced  Even the pacing didnt drag despite being around 2 hours  This is everything I wanted from a DCEU film and more  I would give Shazam A 90100,12
159281,2366번,Shazam!,8,This movie is so good It has hilarious jokes and touching scenes  I loved it so much,3
159760,2384번,Shrek,8,I personally love the movie along with thousands of other people who had the blessing of seeing the classic movie but there is a bit of cussing and inside jokes that some people might understand  Most kids at the age of 8 has at least heard swearing somewhere before so thats why I think 8 is the appropriate age to see Shrek  Children learn about puberty somewhere around the age of 8 so I think its safe to say that it is an appropriate age to see Shrek,3

159764,2384번,Shrek,8,Shrek Is an Amazing Movie I have always loved this movie and the whole series in general this movie still is funny till this day  Eddie murphy as Donkey is so fun to be around in this movie also Shrek Is so Good The best he has ever been Lord Farquad is a believable villain All the performances is good also all of them are not much to say such a classic to Watch I Give Shrek An A,1
159765,2384번,Shrek,8,preceding the middling Shrek The Third  the fan favorite Shrek 2 and my personal favorite Shrek Forever After,1
159766,2384번,Shrek,8,I saw this movie when I was 8 it was on Cartoon Network though never watched the whole entire thing I noticed something inappropriate for a kids film  A PG Rating but well but before that I never heard those until I noticed one  then I watched a video of the cursing scenes with occasional Mild profanity as its used a whole lot While the violence or anything inappropriate isnt too much the Language is im giving this a PG13 Rating Due to The Language,1
159767,2384번,Shrek,8,I loved this and still do  Great movie,2
159768,2384번,Shrek,8,Its fine but    Theres a bit of swearing but there great messages and role modles  So i would belive this is for kids age 11 and up,2
159831,2384번,Shrek,7,When I first watched this film I was a year old and my parents say I used to love it  I would watch shrek 3 times a day inless they had to go out  My parents couldnt believe it  Thats probably why they told me,4
159832,2384번,Shrek,7,While simultaneously embracing and subverting fairy tales the irreverent Shrek also manages to tweak Disneys nose provide a moral message to children and offer viewers a funny fastpaced ride,1
159833,2384번,Shrek,7,this movie was made before i was born but i still love it but also be warned that there is a lot of mild swearing for a kids movie but kids probably wont understand it,1
159834,2384번,Shrek,7,I didnt see this movie when I was young unlike most other kids  And ive just recently watched it  I still found many scenes funny as the jokes appeal to almost every age  Unlike that garbage movie Alvin and the chipmunks,4
159835,2384번,Shrek,7,Has great messages and a satisfying story,1
159836,2384번,Shrek,7,I thought that Shrek had a great story and was well written  However there are uses of ass damn and hell  Also Princess Fiona shows a bit of cleavage  Nothing too concerning but heads up for parents,4
159837,2384번,Shrek,7,I know I watched this a lot when I was little and I watched it on long road trips but I just watched it again with my little brother age 5 and I am starting to notice this movie has multiple adult jokes for older kids  Again I didnt remember anything from when I was younger so it should go over their heads  Swears said damn as crap jackas kissas stupid  and a line said keep your feet of the grass wash your hands wipe your face and another line that people keep reporting but I am 11 and I still dont understand so    Its fine  For violence there is a fire breathing dragon knights fighting and more fighting not graphic its pretty funny and I wouldnt worry too much,5
159838,2384번,Shrek,7,Shrek is a sweetfunny film for all of the family  Donkey is very funny and has some good jokes and all the characters have strong personalities  This film has themes of inner beauty and acceptance  Overall it is a lot fun and I would recommend it for kids,4
159839,2384번,Shrek,7,MOVIE INFO,1
159840,2384번,Shrek,7,Dont let your little one watch this movie unless you want you kids saying bad words that I dont care to repeat   But other then that its a really good movie,2
160241,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,This is my favorite movie of all time  There is just one number that you shouldnt show your young kids  Its called Make em Laugh  Cosmo Brown is just flipping off walls which might make your kid hurt themselves trying to do it  Other than that its a great movie that you should watch,5
160242,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,I enjoyed the movie Singin In The Rain it was a comical movie  My favorite character was Cosmo he had a lot of funny moments  I think that kids will love to watch this movie because of how funny it is  My one favorite song was Make Em Laugh by Cosmo,4
160243,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,I think that this is a good classic movie  Considering that it is a musical with catchy musicI didnt think that there was too much singing in it  The story wasnt to complex but I still enjoyed watching the movie,3
160244,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,A definite classic There is a lot of kissing and a whole lot of singing  Many parts show behind the scenes of making a movie in the silent era  When they are approached with movies with audio they need to get in position  It shows what is needed for a show to go on with some what I would call unnecessary singing,5
160245,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,This movie is great  For a G rating it does have some smoking kissing and some comical violence in the Make Em Laugh scene but not any other bad stuff,3
160246,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,A classic for the Whole Family that is just great,1
160247,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,Singin in the Rain is a wonderful classic musical for the whole family  There are several kisses and champagne and cigars are shown  Also there are some suggestive outfits for only a few shots though  The worst the language gets is dumb and dope  An aweinspiring soundtrack and a whimsical storyline make this musical about American stardom in the 1920s a fantastic film everyone is sure to love,5
160248,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,Singin in the Rain has countless times been named the greatest musical ever made and of course there are many reasons for this all of its songs are memorable it features the most iconic songanddance routine in film history and it celebrates talent creativity and imagination  Some of the comic elements in the film may be too sophisticated for children under 10 but the music is universal and the main focus of the film anyway  A loving tribute to Hollywood and its fickleness there are some selfcentred manipulative characters and passionate romantic moments to stay aware of,3
160249,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,Love it love it love it love it love it  Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooove IT,2
160250,2401번,Singin' in the Rain,8,CSM doesnt always include everything  Did nobody notice that Olgas dressed inappropriatelyShes only shown in two scenes  Also this girl on a poster isnt dressed appropriately  Thats only one 10 second scene  I love Lina Also Don and Kathy kiss 2 times but thats all  Also Lina says 2 insults dope and dumb,8
160663,2421번,Smallfoot,7,I think this movie is the best for 5 year olds its not as bad as u think it is,1
160664,2421번,Smallfoot,7,Small Foot is just a masterpiece  Its really adorable as well definetly would recommend if your into fictional creatures,3
160665,2421번,Smallfoot,7,I thought the music was great and the movie was really cute   I would watch it 3 more times,2
160666,2421번,Smallfoot,7,This was a fun family movie The musical numbers were great and it had a very solid storyline  I found it very entertaining and fun,3
160667,2421번,Smallfoot,7,It is very funny and interesting and also sad  It is fineso the parents can watch it with there kids,1
160668,2421번,Smallfoot,7,I will admit it was better than I expected  Really good for a kids movie funny and cute although a little predictable and silly  Music was soso  In no way did it come off antireligious to me a religious teen  Totally worth the watch for a fun family movie night,5
160669,2421번,Smallfoot,7,My 160000000 year old cranked that Zendata managing the data in movies to be less effective  Excuse me I think gothic teens will might be bored P Okay I will capture the Bigfoot in the 1970s instead ZendayaRants,4
160670,2421번,Smallfoot,7,An unbelievably great movie a list of laughs a mile long,1
160671,2421번,Smallfoot,7,Smallfoot is a good movie that you can watch with friends or family no violence or scary scenes there is about two or three sad parts in it and one part with tranquilizers but aside from that the movie is fun and it will not give any children nightmares the next night hopefully so do not be worried if they say they will be scared if they watch it,1
160873,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,Song of the Sea is a beautifully told story  although the film is based around a little boy who is cruel to his sister and some parts include strange creatures that might make younger kids scared it is a great family movie  the animation is incredible and will be very inspiring to young artists,3
160874,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,This is a movie that is worth rewatching again and again  I say that it is for ages six and up because anyone younger would not appreciate it but it is appropriate for all ages,2
160875,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,I loved this movie  The graphics and story were beautiful  I strongly recommend watching it,3
160876,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,its so cute and extremely good just a little creepy though,1
160877,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,Violance some mild peril  In the beginning the audience is left to believe that a woman died  A boy gets almost hit by a car but the act is possibly played for laughs  An antagonists animals tries to take a child but is protected by other characters and the characters turns to stone by the animals but the child is safe and leaves  Sexy stuff a wife kisses her husband brief  Profanity Ben makes several religious exclaminations like holy molly and Jesus Maria and Josef feic off is written on a door but i didnt know what it meant and other children would probably not focus on that  Drinkingdrugssmoking Conor drinks at a pub in one scene brief which seems to be a habit for him since grandma said something like where were you drinking at the pub no other reference of pub drinking is made  Personally i think younger kids can watch it for the beautiful animation and soundtrack but the story might go over younger kids heads  But the csms age rating is still understandable  a girl goes down to the sea at night alone and swims in one scene Ben and maybe even Saorises goal is to go from the city back to the lighthouse without supervision for the major part of the movie a characters body slowly changesages the characters hair turns white and the body gets weaker  Overall a lovely movie that i recommend,14
160878,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,Okay not to be rude or anything but the Song Of The Sea is a odd movie  The Song Of The Sea is about An Irish youth discovers that his mute sister is a selkie  A half human half seal   Who must find her voice and free supernatural creatures from the spell of a Celtic goddess  So the whole movie is hand drawn which makes all of them look creepy  Then the music is sooo weird  And not to mention the mom abandoned her family to go with the selkie pod It was confusing depressing and just plain weird  I think it might be super popular in Ireland  I just didnt think it was all that good,9
160879,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,scary great role  models but its good and you might  need to go past some parts,1
160880,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,I think that this movie is very good but is a little sad  I would definitely watch this again  The drawings and sound are incredible  Very good,4
160881,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,This movie is really great  It is very complex and I had a hard time understanding the story but the imagery in this movie is unbelievable  I would not recommend this for younger children as the story is very complex and the plot deals with a heavy subject,3
160882,2443번,Song of the Sea,8,I liked the Song of the Sea  It was grate and a litel scarey but other than that it was good,2
161018,2446번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,In the movie it says hell and almost said son of a b,1
161019,2446번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,Its a good movie i dont have anything else to say,1
161020,2446번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,This movie has a lot of stuff,1
161021,2446번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,The movie was exciting and if you liked sonic or not you would like it a lot it had good mix of scenes and makes the viewer intrigued on the movie and I think it would be for kids 9 but it does have a bit of violence so if you dont like violence you might not like it as much and overall it was a good movie,1
161022,2446번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,Plot Sonic is alone on planet earth after fleeing from a tribe that tried to capture him as a child  When the government discovers Sonic they hire Dr  Robotnik Jim Carrey to track him down  Sonic acquires the help of his friend Tom James Marsden to help him get back to his home planet,3
161023,2446번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,I liked it  Some unfinished cursing  Quite good,3
161024,2446번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,fantastic it had a lot of good things and it was a little good and a little good but if you take one good away it is terrible  Scientificly people think that this movie is good the end,2
161025,2446번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,Parents need to know that this film is really good  James Marsden plays a character very similar to his in Hop which could confuse younger viewers  There is a lot of perilaction  In one scene someone drinks  There is lots of positive messages and role models  Some cutoff swearing like son of a  and what the   Lots of consumerism  The whole movie is an avritisement for the video game,8
161486,2461번,Spaceballs,6,I found the humor rather boring and bad a lot of random swearing and such  Wouldnt recommend at all but defiantly not for kids under 13,2
161487,2461번,Spaceballs,6,There is lots of swear words as well as groin related jokes however if your kids are mature enough to no whats not appropriate and what is as well as if your okay maybe covering your kids eyes in a couple of seams  But other then that its a great movie that well leave you laughing,2
161488,2461번,Spaceballs,6,Spaceballs is a 1987 comedy movie directed by Mel Brooks and starring Rick Moranis Bill Pullman Mel Brooks John Candy and Daphne Zuniga,1
161489,2461번,Spaceballs,6,This is a decent comedy spoof  It is funny and interesting to see how the original Star Wars characters are portrayed in this parody  The movie has some mild innuendo and a good amount of language including fck once sht and asshole  Its laughoutloud hilarious but its only a 3 star movie,4
161490,2461번,Spaceballs,6,this is the best mel brooks move  is is much funny,2
161491,2461번,Spaceballs,6,This is a good movie but more for the older audience,1
161492,2461번,Spaceballs,6,This spoof on classic sciencefiction movies can be very dumb and wacky but thats what makes it so unique  The humor used throughout has very wacky concepts to it but yet these concepts are very innovative when used and are able to effectively satirize Star Wars Alien and more with successful results,2
161493,2461번,Spaceballs,6,Spaceballs is a great Mel Brooks comedy with a laugh in a minute guarantee by all of the comedy lovers,1
161494,2461번,Spaceballs,6,Spaceballs is actually the first spoof movie I ever saw and it was very funny and in a creative way  Sure some of the humor is predictable but all of the humor is very creative  Mel Brooks has created humor that NO ONE has ever thought of doing  Like when Dark Helmet accidentally hits a cameraman with his Schwartz it is very creative and hilarious  Mel Brooks Rick Moranis John Candy and Bill Pullman were perfect for their roles and gave me something to laugh at several times throughout the movie  However it gets pretty dirty halfway through,6

161695,2471번,Spider-Man 2,8,I love this movie but it is violent and has long kissing scenes,1
161696,2471번,Spider-Man 2,8,How is this ok for kids The wife sees a pane of glass hurtling towards her the entire emergency room staff are gutted  We stopped watching when the grandmother was dropped offa building  Not ok for kids,4
161697,2471번,Spider-Man 2,8,Wow spider man 2 is the best spider man movie ever it was amazing I watched this movie when I was 7 and I loved it doc ock is a great villain the actors are amazing cgi was great for the time cgi still holds up kinda and I totally recommend this movie but if this is your kids 1st pg13 movie then I would go for spider man homecoming then this movie,1
161698,2471번,Spider-Man 2,8,The only scene that you have to worry about is the medic scene its not scary its very violent for young kids and the concept of it is scary,1
161699,2471번,Spider-Man 2,8,Not for younger kids but for older kid teens and tweens perfect  SpiderMan 2 is one of my favorite movies,2
161846,2472번,Spider-Man 3,8,SpiderMan  3 may not not be the best of the series but it  is still really good and is a enjoyable  actionpacked blockbuster that you wont  wanna miss,1
161847,2472번,Spider-Man 3,8,This movie has too much violence  It gave me nightmares  I had a nightmare of a character named Venom  I think this movie should be rated R for intense action violence,4
161848,2472번,Spider-Man 3,8,The only reason why this movie gets so much hate is because the critics werent having it  It truly is spectacular how movie critics can sway the popular opinion surrounding a movie as great as SpiderMan 3  After overcoming various obstacles in the previous two movies Peter Parker SpiderMan is in the prime of his life  Hes with the girl of his dreams the city of New York loves him and hes just been given the key to the city  Peter eventually lets his pride get to him and he becomes oblivious to the troubles that those closest to him are facing  This lack of selfawareness leads to the untimely breakup between him and MJ and makes him susceptible to the symbiote suit which latches on to him halfway through the movie  This event gives rise to the black suited SpiderMan and consequently a cockier and even more oblivious emostyled Peter Parker  In exchange for enhanced powers and confidence Peter gives his humanity and kindness which made him who he was in the previous two movies  His newfound ferocious nature leads him to ferociously beatdown on Sandman and after believing that he has killed him Peter returns to his apartment   After a dispute with his beloved landlord Mr  Ditkovich Peter realizes that the black suit is bad for him and promptly puts it away  Mr  Ditkovich then helps Peter out by giving him some advice on how to flirt with MJ which includes the famous lines You are good woman I am good man  From then on the movie becomes all the more actionpacked leading to a thrilling climax at the end where Peter teams up with Harry to fight both Sandman and Venom  Would recommend to all buy this movie and show it to your kids,13
161849,2472번,Spider-Man 3,8,SpiderMan 3 is a good movie  Its still a competent addition to the Raimi Trilogy but its undoubtedly the worst in it  I used to really like this movie but upon rewatching it my opinion changed  I still had fun with it but there was a lot of bad parts in the movie probably more so than good parts  The characters seem pretty different from the first two and the story is so rushed that its hard to get invested in this film,5
161850,2472번,Spider-Man 3,8,This was personally my favorite of the three spiderman movies its theme was a little more mature than the other two spiderman aka peter parker almost goes evil in one section of the movie and it might be upsetting for kids when harry tries to kill peter in the end  But peter fights the temptation of becoming evil,2
161851,2472번,Spider-Man 3,8,Okay great movie  It has three villains Hobgoblin Venom and Sandman  I dont know what they were thinking with including Hobgoblin and Venom  They let Hobgoblin get a good play in the end but Venom No  It was nice to have Venom as a sidevillain but they did a great job with Sandman,6
161852,2472번,Spider-Man 3,8,Probably the best of the three this movie is quite a bit more intense than the first two if your kid was a little scared of the first two wait until heshe is 8,1
161853,2472번,Spider-Man 3,8,Parents need to know that this is the third film in the SpiderMan franchise  It has lots of violence  Peter has some scary nightmares  Peter is really mean in some scenes and strikes someone he loves  SPOILER ALERT Many important characters die including one character who is a minor villain but a main character as well as a main character from the other two films That one is really sad  Lots of I am going to mary someone else or I will date your girlfriend kind of thing  Good Movie  The evil goo might scare younger viewers,8
161854,2472번,Spider-Man 3,8,there is so much stabbing not so much cursing though if a kid under 8 watched it they would get nightmares,1
162267,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,Pros Plot was nice there was a lot of humor and it teaches nice lessons like unity and friendship  Also good animation,2
162268,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,More for younger kids,1
162269,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,Im a very simple girl  I instantly love almost everything at watchread  But this This has gotta be the first piece of media excluding music  that has weirded me out  And even then I rate it 3 stars  Anyways as for anything parents should be concerned about,6
162270,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH His hand shrinks,2
162271,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,When I watched this I expected something funny or sad or something but I got garbage  It has enough potty humor and nude scenes to make a five year old laugh for days  There were no surprises or anything that would shock the viewer so dont waste your time with it,3
162272,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,Theres nothing really inappropriate in spies in disguise  There is a scene with a naked man but you cant see anything to bad  you do see his butt very clearly but besides that theres no bad nudity  There is a normal amount of violence for a animated kids actioncomedy movie   As usual theres gross jokes and humor that will entertain a 58  That pretty much raps up my review the sad thing is that they had so much potential with this movie and they did nothing with it such talented voice actors to really a shame,6
162273,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,Super good it funny and surprising you should watch this your kids will love it,1
162274,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,Fun movie with nice story   Some parents comments are exagerated  This is a nice fun movie to watch,3
162284,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,Spies in Disguise is a great movie  It is a funny movie and a little sad  It is a great adventure story Wilbur is a great role model,4
162285,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,not funny but super funny haha i loved it,1
162286,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,I have seen on here that some parents are leaving reviews of 18 Like really This is such an awesome movie How is it disgusting It has a picked on nerdy kid who saves the day And plus it is unlikely friends that do it together It is a kids movie and the naked parts arent even that bad for you to be covering your kids eyes And those who are saying the boy said Fifty Shades of Yeah how is that bad if I may ask It is not like he is saying Fifty Shades of Grey  There are some dramatic people out there that dont deserve to write reviews on here  It is just made to be funny especially for kids If you say you wasted your money maybe you should have read the reviews and then maybe considered instead of just watching the movie and leaving a horrible an overexaggerated review Very disappointed in some of these reviews ugh,14
162287,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,I love this film I think it should be a TV show,2
162288,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,It was meh Tom Holland is always great but there were moments that were a bit cringe  They had some millennial memes under disguise there was a scene of nudity that was uncomfortable oh god dont get me started on the sumo thing  It just made me and the very very Christian homeschool girl Im friends with super uncomfortable,3
162289,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,Spies in disguise is a great movie in almost every way  Will Smith and Tom Holland knock it out of the park with voice acting it has detailed animation it is hilarious and it might just be one of my favorite movies  Expect some more mature themes though  Lots of violence and people dying not on screen but implied many moments where characters almost swear and there is some drinking  This movie is a must watch please watch it,5
162290,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,I think this movie is very very funny but there is a scary when the guy shows his robot self,1
162291,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,Great movie with lots of jokes  Love the cast not a lot of bad stuff,2
162292,2474번,Spies in Disguise,6,best family film ever,1
162293,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,This movie    supercalafragilisticexpialodocious I loved this movie I thought it was just stunning The animation the storyline    But there is violence like kicking punching spy stuff  Mild language such as hell heck and the fword but it is beeped out,7
162294,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,This movie is very   funny,1
162295,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,Great movie with Will Smith and Tom Holland,2
162296,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,This is so awesome,1
162297,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,Scene where some male figure shows nudity  almost to the point of revealing the male gentalia      I was disgusted and couldnt believe the detail in art work that was sexually explicit   The f was bleeped and totally unnecessary  why pretend to use a cuss word as a bleep  it was annoying   just filth in my opinion   The majority of the humor is towards a younger age audience but the scenes I mentioned just took away from the humor and makes this a movie not a great pick for kids    I told my mom not to let my younger siblings watch it,5
162298,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,Although Spies in Disguise is a very comedic movie with great voice actors it has lots of violent scenes that make you say Ouch or Oooo out loud while watching the movie  My parents really enjoyed Spies in Disguise so I guess there are mixed feeling about it but every movie has different people watching it w opinions right If you are looking for a very funny kids spy movie and you dont care about watching some characters battle it out then this movie should be your top pick,5
162299,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,it is hilarious but when there in kamoras apartmant they say hands up and see kamoras butt little kids find it funny though,1
162300,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,I am 14 years old and I watched it with my family and enjoyed it nd laughed  This Animation is suitable for all ages and i totally recommend,2
162301,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,Its very good  its really funny  It has potty humor and has some peril but overall has great messages and roll models,3
162302,2474번,Spies in Disguise,8,Parents need to know that this movie is very good,1
162406,2477번,Spirited Away,7,i love all the Japanese films from studio ghilbi and this was one of my favorites  the beautiful animation and characters are a masterpiece and the story is amazing  though the movie is beautifully done some scenes are bloody and violent,3
162407,2477번,Spirited Away,7,This is a really good movie Its about a girl whos parents are turned into pigs  She tries to find them but there a lot of other things that she has to do  This movie can be creepy but not too creepy  However there are a few scary parts so if you have a child who gets scared easilythis movie might not be great for them,5
162408,2477번,Spirited Away,7,i think its a wonderfull movie but maybe a little of a lot of violence,1
162409,2477번,Spirited Away,7,Beautiful movie cool story but can be scary when a dragon gets hurt and is bleeding all over the place,1
162410,2477번,Spirited Away,7,This is my absolute favorite movie of all time However I would NOT recommend this for children under the age of 10 or children that get creeped out easily  There are several extremely disturbing characters such as No Face a spirit that goes crazy and eats people  His appearance may also be frightening to some viewers  The parents turn into giant pigs at the beginning which could also frighten children  However the 10yearold main character is very brave and goes through lots of solid character development throughout the movie she goes from being bratty and lazy to being brave and kind and the one of the themes that I personally took from the movie was kindness,6
162411,2477번,Spirited Away,7,It may be a little bit creepy for younger children but i LOVE IT  There is a few parts like a frog smoking the babys butt is not covered  a boy in dragon form getting attacked by paper birds and bleeding and throwing up blood and almost bleeding to death and a creature named Noface luring people with gold and eating them  I have no idea how 7 year olds could be scared by this  Just make sure that your child is mature enough to not be scared by ghosts and things  Just know that this is 5 stars,5
162412,2477번,Spirited Away,7,Yes Princess Mononoke is good Howls moving castle is good  But they do not come close to this film  Spirited away is a great movie  I think ages 10 will really enjoy it   There is nothing bad in it although when No face becomes crazy and starts to eat people that might scare some younger kids but it is not too bad,5
162413,2477번,Spirited Away,7,Spirited Away is a beautiful movie one that makes you immediately want to watch it again  The soundtrack is lovely  the characters are all memorable and likable even the bad guys and visually the movie is stunning,2
162414,2477번,Spirited Away,7,I am 7 years old and I have watched spirited away  For me it is  6 and up  But I can see how other people may not  like it and be scared of it  SUPER AWSOME AND EXCITING,4
162686,2485번,Spy Kids,7,Just the right combination of fantasy and comedy,1
162687,2485번,Spy Kids,7,VIOLENCE SCARINESS AND GORE  People are turned into mutant creatures for a kids TV show in the movie  The show also has a lot of fingers designed to look like humans  Might creep kids out  No blood,4
162688,2485번,Spy Kids,7,Exciting familyfriendly tale with some violence peril,1
162689,2485번,Spy Kids,7,Pretty solid film but there is one scene where the mom of the kids whispers into the dads ear to persuade him  This is a bit sexual,2
162690,2485번,Spy Kids,7,This movie is very boring and bad  The sister character is annoying and unlikable  This is one of the most overrated and boring movies Ive ever seen,3
162691,2485번,Spy Kids,7,AMAZING film but bewarned of one almost 4 letter word,1
162692,2485번,Spy Kids,7,Spy Kids was my favorite movie as a kid and I still love it today  I used to watch it all the time when I was younger  This movie has a lot of great role models  Yes its a little stupid but overall it was very ahead of its time  It has good representation strong female leads Hispanic family a good plot and its enjoyable to watch  I strongly recommend this movie for all ages  Some younger kids could be startled by the fooglies and they could not understand the plot,7
162693,2485번,Spy Kids,7,GREAT  Six year olds can really enjoy this amazing film  Even the grown up spies are GREAT  Yeah suitable for six and over,4
162950,2491번,Stand by Me,7,THIS WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS  Stand by me is a sweet movie about four 12 year olds go on a quest to search for a dead body  A ton of strong language is used  It is one of my favorite movies  My favorite kid is teddy  I would rather let kids watch this then disney crap  While the boys search another group and up beating the boys to the body   Gordy pulls out a gun  None of the groups take this body  Later the body if found and neither of the groups is given credit  Amazing movie with awesome ,11
162951,2491번,Stand by Me,7,This movie follows four best friends going on possibly their last adventure together  There is quite a lot of cussing  But as Wil Wheaton said Parents who think their kids dont cuss are just fooling themselves  This movie is amazing and perfect for growing teens  I would recommend to anyone who cares to see it,5
162952,2491번,Stand by Me,7,This is an example of a rating completely baffling me  If this didnt have the F bombs and smoking it would be PG  I actually encourage you to show any kid 6 and up this movie its rated so unfairly  Realistic language that 12 year old boys actually speak I should know  A few kids smoke cigarettes but if your kid has seen someone smoke in real life its no different  Wheres your kid going to get cigarettes anyway A few kids talk about tits again like we actually do in real life  At the end a dead body is seen not too graphic a little blood  The movie has great messages behind it like friendship and loyalty and even just doing the right thing  The main character is a great role model except for the smoking,10
162953,2491번,Stand by Me,7,people die and kids do drugs but still one of the best,1
162954,2491번,Stand by Me,7,This is a fantastic movie  Ive seen this countless times since I was around 8  I have two younger siblings whom have grown up watching it  While there is plenty of swearing some smoking and it really evolves around a search for a murdered body I really think that the overall message of friendship and loyalty hence the name Stand By Me over powers it all  And yes there are sexual innuendos like most shows and movies these days  They will fly over the younger audiences heads  I really think that if your child has been exposed to any media violence and rough language this movie is fine for them to watch,7
162955,2491번,Stand by Me,7,Great movie  I watched it when I was 10 first R rated movie  It has strong lenguge 11f words 110 uses of py 1 use ck possibly 1 use of ct  This also has four 12 year old boys talk about sexual stuff boobsetc eight 18 year old boys talk about getting laid  12 year olds carry around around a 45 caliber  Very intense but still if your kid has played gta4or5 they will love this movie,5
162956,2491번,Stand by Me,7,The movie is funny clever depressing adventurous and chilling all at the same time  Dont let the R rating put you away from the film  There is some strong language but there are lots of positive messages of growing up strong with others  A great classic,4
162957,2491번,Stand by Me,7,stand by me is a great moviebut has a lot of language and smoking,1
162958,2491번,Stand by Me,7,I think this is completely okay for early teens   As far as the language goes thats what 12 and 13 yr olds actually talk like   There are some references to  child abuse both physical and emotional but its not bad at all   Stand By Me is the perfect movie for teens,4
162959,2491번,Stand by Me,7,Its a great movie about 4 boys who act older as their adventure goes on Interesting movie about how kids grow up and become teenagers,1
163031,2494번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,I didnt think this series could get any better but it does This movie kind of shows up the previous one but the first one sets up nicely for this one,2
163032,2494번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,Star Trek Into Darkness is a 2013 scifi movie directed by J  J  Abrams and starring Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Benedict Cumberbatch Alice Eve Simon Pegg and Leonard Nimoy,1
163033,2494번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,JJ Abrams is a good director  His best attributes have to be his attention to detail intricacies in characters and intense suspense,2
163034,2494번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,Overall this movie is very good  At the discretion of parents I would not allow a kid to watch this movie until they are AT LEAST 14,2
163035,2494번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,This film has a lot of violence and is very intense  There is strong punching kick shooting stabbing and more  On one bit a guy crushes a mans head and stamps on a whoman lying on the floor  She then has to go to hospital meaning it was A bad injury  On one fight scene there is very strong violence and a man gets his neck snapped  They are also being continuously punched and being slammed against walls  It is very stressful and intense  There is bad language used very often including bloody bastard bitch shit ass crap damn and more  The language is not as bad as the first one because that one has an F bomb at the beginning  Going back to the violence there is some blood  Whomen are shown in bed topless with men and there is lots of underwear  For mature 10 year olds or 11 year olds  There is great messages and role model as the captain dies to save his crew  Spoiler alert   he comes back to life  Also enemies become friends in the film  There is also drinking at a bar,16
163036,2494번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,Omagersh this movie was absolutely terrible The plot was really only for a gasp for the audience  They were more concerned with the gasp than the Wow  That was really interesting Its certainly making me think,5
163037,2494번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,Amazing movie  I think the storyline is amazing and the acting is superb  J J Abrams did an amazing job on this film if it even is a little bit violent I think little kids may not like this movie as it is a bit scary for their age group Their is a few st  and a word very close to the Fword  This 2 and a half hour movie is great and definitely worth your time,4
163038,2494번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,This was a an excellent second movie It was not disappointing at all There were some creepy parts but they really werent too bad Overall it is a fantastic movie to watch  ,5
163039,2494번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,My rating hard PG13 for graphic nudity racy content language and some bloody violence,1
163306,2511번,Steve Jobs,8,great,1
163307,2511번,Steve Jobs,8,I am a Apple Fan and I honestly love this movie  It tells about how we got the device that we know and love today  However try watching it together if you have a 67 year old as it does contain some language,3
163308,2511번,Steve Jobs,8,Why is everyone making a huge deal about the appropriateness of this movie Its literally just swearing  And Ive heard WAY more swearing in other movies  By age 8 Id heard all these words before  Its not like kids will watch this movie and suddenly start cussing At one point Jobs asks his assistant Why havent we slept together which is the only reference to sex in the entire movie,7
163309,2511번,Steve Jobs,8,I think the format of this movie is really interesting  When I started to watch it I thought it was going to be like every other biopic but I actually found it very engaging I also think the casting is great especially Michael Fassbender,3
163310,2511번,Steve Jobs,8,There is no other film with such perfect timing and dialogue  An overwhelming sense of emotion is tirelessly infused within the script  The acting portrays not just the characters but human stories that all can relate with  The music is a collision much like Jobs of creativity yet also pause  This film is a miracle,5
163311,2511번,Steve Jobs,8,A TON OF UNNECESSARY CUSSING Buuuuuut if your kid can handle it its ok  I watched it because my dad worshiped him lol  It was a good educational movie,4
163312,2511번,Steve Jobs,8,Michael Fassbenders portrayal and Danny Boyles direction really shine here as both of them show brilliant roles in their part   Aron Sorkins dialogue also is amazing  Also the cinematography is brilliant and was amazing to see that in the first act a 16 mil lens was used than a 18 mil lens in the second act ans then was shot on digital cameras to show the progression of technology,3
163313,2511번,Steve Jobs,8,This was a really interesting movie because it  didnt have any plot at all  it was basically just Steve Jobs launching three different products with no flashbacks showing you his past life or careers at all  Whether youre intrigued or utterly confused at that type of filmmaking is a matter of personal opinion  However what is NOT a matter of personal opinion is the frequent usage of strong language such as fk st ahole and the like  Also something that CSM didnt cover which is part of the reason Im writing this review is that a Time magazine interview in which Steve Jobs joked that 28 of American men slept with his wife and therefore produced his daughter which later comes back at him is referenced a lot especially towards the beginning  Overall the film isnt that bad contentwise especially for an Rrated movie and is appropriate for teens to see if it holds their interest that is  My MPAA rating R for language,7
163314,2511번,Steve Jobs,8,Though this is my favorite movie The Language has some dmns,1

166299,2574번,Tarzan,6,Well honestly this seems a perfect movie for a five year old  For a G movie its violent for little ones because,2
166300,2574번,Tarzan,6,I was really dissapointed  Women shouldnt be showing of their elbows all the time  Its disgusting  A woman should be modest  My 10 year old son couldnt stop ogling those elbows  It was awful,6
166301,2574번,Tarzan,6,It is rated G and a great movie,1
166302,2574번,Tarzan,6,This movie is kind of good  Kids will love this Disneycartoon movie  This movie is kind of funny and has humor  Though this movie is kind of intense  Shooting is involve  There is some brief cruleness  Mild sex is involve,7
166303,2574번,Tarzan,6,Good example of a golden age Disney movie,1
166304,2574번,Tarzan,6,I just want to say there is SO much death in this movie First Tarzans parents are unceremoniously eaten by a leopard within the first five minutes and you can see bloody pawprints surrounding them  Then a little baby gorilla is out with his family and he chases a butterfly away from his parents  Were all thinking Aww what a little cutie maybe this will be a sweet movie after all And then the leopard comes  The father gorilla knows they wont be able to save the baby so he holds the mother gorilla back  The poor little baby gorilla is eaten by the leopard offscreen but you can still hear the poor thing screaming in pain and the mother gorilla just hides her face against her husbandmate and cries  Then at the end of the movie the alpha gorilla is shot and killed leaving poor Tarzan heartbroken but in charge of the gorilla troop  And then in the worst Disney death EVER the hunter guy gah I cant remember his name    gets tangled in vines and tries to cut himself free  Little does he know there is a vine entwined around his neck and he basically hangs himself by mistake  You see him plummeting and screaming and then the screen pans to Tarzans shocked face  Then a convenient little flash of lightning illuminates the villains dead body  I know that villains should be punished but that seems a bit far dont you think ANYWAYS the reason I gave three stars instead of one is that the plotline of Tarzan learning how to be human is really sweet and funny  Also I love the music especially Trashing the Camp EARWORM ALERT So if your kids can handle the gore and death I think this is a pretty good movie  Still I wish that not as many characters died  That kind of ruined it for me as I am very sensitive about that kind of thing   Im not saying I hate this movie  In fact I think its pretty good  I just get kind of upset whenever anyone dies  P S Watch Trashin the camp  Look at that teapot  ITS MRS  POTTS I freaked when I saw that  LOL,26
166305,2574번,Tarzan,6,This movie is very frightening but older kids 10 to 12 year olds will love it  In one scene Tarzan cuts open a leopard and Kerchacks death is very sad  There are some good messages like that characters can fit in even when they are from different places   Though most of the good messages are blocked out by guns there are still a few more like that you may get injured when saving your friends but it is worth it   Clayton is very scary   His actions involve killing a few gorillas   His death is very violent   Overall it is a good movie for tweens,8
166382,2580번,Teen Beach Movie,8,I saw the premiere at the beach then my sister watched over and over again it was a movie about Mack Maia Mitchell and Brady Ross Lynch I thought fallin for you was pretty catchy but I hated the rest of the movie I couldnt get past 30 minutes dont bother with this movie watch High School Musical if you like musicals and Disney channel,1
166383,2580번,Teen Beach Movie,8,I personally thought this movie was cute fun and enjoyable I really dont see how it can be considered inappropriate in any way there isnt even any kissing  The romance between Brady and Mac is so subtle that I didnt even realize that they were more than friends until they mentioned a possible breakup  And for the people complaining about the revealing swimwear they are at the beach What do you want them to wear full bodysuits The bathing suits are 60s fashion so I honestly think they are a lot more modest looking than current ones are and you can see nude colored material at certain points that the actresses are wearing under their costumes so nothing is revealed  For the love of god your child isnt going to become a sexcrazed demon because they saw a girls stomach  As for the plot itself there are definitely plot holes but none that really take away from the film  The whole mad scientist bit was just dumb and unnecessary and I think everyone else can agree with that as well  The cast was pretty good I dont really care that much for ross lynch I felt like I was watching the same exact character from Austin and Ally  Everyone else was great though There are tons of positive messages cliche ones like follow your dream and ones I was pleasantly surprised by there is more to life than trying to attract boys  The musical numbers were fun and catchy overplayed a bit in commercials but that shouldnt be a surprise  Overall I really think this movie is safe for young ones and fun for older kids too my brother is 10 and loves it,14
166384,2580번,Teen Beach Movie,8,This movie never appealed to me at all especially being an eleven yr  Old  The charachter cast and meager confusing storyline makes for a performance that is far below disneys usual standards,2
166385,2580번,Teen Beach Movie,8,This movie was HORRIBLE  It was corny and had no real humor  Love was basically directing this whole film if you know what I mean  But the cheesy kind of love  Just kissing and all that  It was just so bad,6
166386,2580번,Teen Beach Movie,8,It has a positive idea but is probably too childish for anyone over ten,1
166387,2580번,Teen Beach Movie,8,People keep saying that the movie is very inappropriatethey dont curse once there is no product placement and there is a great message  I mean sure there are bikinis and guys with their shirts off but do you want to take your family to the beach Well thats what youre gonna see  Kids arent gonna say I wanna be like Brady and take their shirts off  If you think kids are like sponges know that sponges dont take their shirts off,5
166388,2580번,Teen Beach Movie,8,This movie is terrible it has a bad soundtrack and a horrible story plot  so I go down in a wave and come back up in a 1950s movie seems pretty fun to me  NOT I would rather watch Baby Einstein for the rest of my life then Watch this movie again even though I only saw 30 minutes of it,4
166389,2580번,Teen Beach Movie,8,this is a dumb movie firstthis movie is so not about 60s n everything seems like now a lot of girl dress inapropriettall bootsshortsbikinis this movie is trying to make 60s look really modern and similar to todaybut its not like that watch west side story that movie talks about racisam n another social problems in the 60s and 70s i think kids need to know the truth about the 60s and disney always makes thing look betterherculessleeping beauty and another lies,1
166390,2580번,Teen Beach Movie,8,No matter what its about awesome movie ,2

166521,2585번,Teletubbies,8,God help me I think I saw the Devil while watching this show  Although people say the Devilor Satan is bad he enlightened me to know that hes a nice guy   Et reversus est diaboli  Memento mori,4
166522,2585번,Teletubbies,8,I absolutely hate this show irritating disturbing cringe and teaches no educational value,1
166523,2585번,Teletubbies,8,Common Sense Media How can you give this three stars This is the worst show ever  Annoying and this gave me a headache  0 stars  Irritating  After watching this show I feel like throwing up,7
166524,2585번,Teletubbies,8,User Chris the custom says his 2 year old little sister made custard and then added drugs in it How and why does your two year old sister make custard And how does she get the drugs to put in it,3
166525,2585번,Teletubbies,8,Teletubbies is really annoying  It teaches kids how to speak gibberish and the babys face on the sun looks really weird and disturbing  Do not watch the show  Teletubbies face looks really disturbing as well  No educational value in it  Not even 1 bit,6
166880,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,The whirlwind animated adventure is a visual treat for tweens,1
166881,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,The Adventures of  Tintin has lots of adventure you guessed it and violence with pirates fighting some blood and lots of guns  Also the story is nice and ambiguous  Some may love this however what brings the movie rating down for me is that some scenes were too unreal and their was too much drinking  Once a pirate captain got directly hit by lightning but he was completely fine afterwards  Also the main character had been chased by pirates with guns at least ten times but did not get hit The worst part was probably where the drinking So much and even the dog got drunk This is way to unrealistic  Did I mention the dog is as smart as a human and seems to understand english,9
166882,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,Unless you are prepared to deal with nightmares or acts of pretend violence this movie is for you,1
166883,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,This movie is really fun I like it Its just a nice adventure movie to watch if you dont want to watch something emotional  TINTIN MY BELOVED   Great movie,5
166884,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,It is a good movie but they could have done it a little more entertaining,1
166885,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,this movie is great but there are tons of guns haddock is obsessed with alcohol and the blood on the newspaper seems really realistic for CGI,1
166886,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,I remember watching this for the first time back 2011 and being absolutely blown away by the visuals  The writing was a lot more mature but fun,2
166887,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,This is actually my favorite moviethough I am bit biased due to the fact that it was my childhood movie My parents didnt know that it was a more mature movie and brought me a long when I was 3   the action and violence flew over my head and I didnt really know what was happening  Though I was not scared by it I dont recommend that age After I grew older and learned to appreciate this movie I came to love it   I found the books and it made the movie even more of a treat  Tintin is a great role model and is the best Captain Haddocks drinking problem can not be ignored though  If you show it to kids you might want to inform about that and tell them it is bad  And if there is a child in the room you might want to tell them to close their eyes when the man is shot with a machine gun  Other than that the violence is mild with a few punches and missed gun shots,10
166888,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,This is pretty much appropriate for all ages as long as you skip through the violent scenes,1
166966,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,I say the violence only tentatively  Men get shot stabbed yet blood is only seen once  Most people hold gunsfire weapons  Haddock goes quite crazy after drinking and he drinks a lot  Tintin is quite intelligent resourceful and tough  Thompson and Thompson are humorous in that they are slightly reminiscent of the three stooges  An interesting point is that only one woman is seen in the whole movie  She is only secondary however  Also a startling point is that no children are present whatsoever  Tintin may look young but that premonition is quickly blown away,10
166967,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,I saw this movie when it came out in 3D this movie kept my intrest in this movie but my mom was kind of bored in some parts  so take your kids to see this movie it like indiana jones met pirates of the caribbean,2
166968,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,Like my title the books were way better trust me I know I have them all even the ones not released in the US like Tintin in the Congo  The movie is still good and is a must see for any Tintin fan  The Rating is PG which is solid but it is leaning to PG13 there is a man who gets shot partway into the movie and it shows him falling to the ground with some blood  Drinking is also a main theme in the movie but the positive rollmodels and the messages in the movie more then make up for the bad things age wise  This is a movie almost any age could see if they didnt mind some violence and a little blood  The humor is great  All in all a great movie for anyone,7
166969,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,When Nickelodeon Productions popped out of no where with the hit movie Rango I was baffled  It had a great mystery plot and best of all excellent CGI graphics  I loved it,3
166970,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,Steven Spielbergs long awaited and hotly anticipated new holiday movie One of two the other being War Horse which I have yet to see myself The adventures of Tintin is for all of the rave reviews and huge foreign and worldwide box office success and the long year of hype and anticipation thrown at Spielbergs feet it is just absolutely heartbreaking for me to report that I was greatly disappointing  And to add I have been a lifelong fan of the original Herge comics so I am not exactly very new to the whole Tintin franchise in the first place Tintin is very nice looking in fact it quiet possibly and very easily has by far the best use of motioncapture animation and computer animation technology that I have ever seen in any movie thus far  But that is the only good thing bout it  Tintin is a lifeless extremely long and almost interminably dull movie that quit on the viewer long before it even gets to its depressing futile ending  It appears that the magic of Spielbergs movies have been absent from his films for some six or seven years now  Here just hoping that War Horse still has some of that left in it  But despite being Rated PG and being marketed heavily and almost completely towards children The Adventures of Tintin is certainly not for young kidsThere is infrequent but very intense and brutal for an animated movie cartoon violence with several rather harsh deaths and scenes which actually also have quiet of bit of animated blood  Also there is constant nonstop drinking and alcohol use and consumption in the form of the sidecharacter of Captain Haddock who is a great drunk  Finally there is extremely infrequent mild language with only one use of real profanity in the entire movie with that being in the form of dmn  So if you did like many people did happen to like it than great  I just wish it could have been much better than it unfortunately and depressingly was,11
166971,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,The adventures of Tintin is great movie to see with family friends or by yourself  The main character is a young reporter who unknowingly falls into an adventure that takes him around the world  Tintin is well meaning and wants to help most people but also fights when he has to  I dont think many people noticed but there arent that many female characters but that doesnt hold it back  It is violent at sometimes one character getting machine gunned to death but thats the most violence  One character is usually drunk and people dont like it but he overcomes his alcoholism,6
166972,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,Great animation  My rating Intense action crude humor drinking and a murder,2
166973,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,The movie was very violent lots of gun fights dark and confusing for children   My 8yearold daughter laughed out loud a few times but she didnt understand the story  the pace was fast the vocabulary was often over her head and the allusions obscure,2
166974,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,This movie is definitely familyfriendly but as a 13yearold I was seriously disappointed  It went on too long and there were only 2 laughoutloud moments in the entire movie  It didnt really capture my attention because the storyline was hard to follow  I eventually got it but it was just confusing  My personal opinion is that this movie was boring and would definitely be enjoyed more by younger kids,5
166975,2615번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,We run a pretty conservative household and I took my 4year old daughter and 6year old son   Bear in mind we have almost no computer time yet for them and very little TV    so our bar for acceptable media is pretty high   I was a little concerned some of the content could be scary for my daughter so we discussed in advance    Both kids just loved the movie  it was not scary to either of them and the violence was completely antiseptic in my view and not inappropriate at all   Believe me theres nothing appealing about Capt  Haddocks drinking  its a lot more likely to push kids away from a drink than towards it   Simply wonderful movie,7
167008,2623번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,The Amazing SpiderMan 2 may have a bit of mistakes but this was my absolute favorite I think what interested me was the SpiderMan costume because it looked exactly like the same suit in the comics  This movie has been AMAZING for me Andrew Garfield is awesome at SpiderMan and Emma Stone is great at acting as Gwen Stacy,4
167009,2623번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,Some good messages Think with great power comes great responsibility But sadly consumerism  With AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 costumes to hats to MARVEL SELECT toys  Do not forget McDonalds was a thing in this production BTW Andrew was my fave but now i am SUCH THE FAN of Tom Holland and even got a morphsuit of Tom Hollands Spidey suit,3
167010,2623번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,Not Really Violent Not really Sexual but lots of Consumerism  The Plot is very Clunky but overall Parents i guess its okay to let your kids watch this,2
167011,2623번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,Great SpiderMan movie  Does have a lot of violence but with really good role models,2
167012,2623번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,This movie isnt that good  It has 3 villains and a bunch of plot holes that are confusing  Overall just dont watch it  There are better spider man movies out there  As a huge spider man fan myself I feel a bit disappointed,5
167013,2623번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,This is one of the worst movies Ive ever seen  Violence includes deaths of characters disease electric shots out of hands gun shots action destruction and bombs  SpiderMan is a really bad role model and is mean to others  This movie scarred history forever,4
167014,2623번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,Andrew Garfield stars as SpiderMan in this sloppy forgettable SpiderMan movie  The plot is confusing Electro is a villain because he has no friends and Peter Parker is a jerk to multiple people  Expect lots and lots of violence and kissing in the movie that tarnished the name of SpiderMan,3
167015,2623번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,This movie is GREAT But this is important   In terms of language I heard multiple use of goddamn and damn about 3 uses of ass  5 hell and 1 Holy st  Violence includes neck snapping explosions gunfire falling from heights and choking  Overall good movie but watch it with your kids,4
167016,2623번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,i dont know why critics are calling this the worst spiderman film this had a 52 on rotten tomatoes and guess what spiderman 3 had a 63 honestly critics these days  But listen to me instead this is actually really fun so skip spiderman 3 and watch this,3

167194,2624번,The Amazing Spider-Man,8,WOOWOOWOWOWO This is Amazing This is the best marvel movie I ever seen I laughed and cried It is violence but not so much blood showing  There are kissing one guy without shirt and a girl kissing  I LOVE Andrew Peter Parker,7
167195,2624번,The Amazing Spider-Man,8,Awesome film This film is really good and is fine for a kid to watch,2
167196,2624번,The Amazing Spider-Man,8,Some violence shooting one stabbing  Movie is very entertaining and intense  Good storyline  Little kids will probably be scared  Overall very good movie 9,6
167197,2624번,The Amazing Spider-Man,8,As for why they made a reboot I am not sure as Spiderman 3 was fantastic but as for the reboot there is lots of coming book violence but the new Peter Parker is a very positive role model for young kids,1
167198,2624번,The Amazing Spider-Man,8,Its the same SpiderMan story with a different twist   Peters girlfriends father is a police chief and the villain is Peters mentor   I enjoyed it even more than the first Andrew Garfield is cute and dorky and his girlfriend Emma Stone plays your notsotypical blonde   Overall charming and a mustsee for Marvel nerds,4
167199,2624번,The Amazing Spider-Man,8,not as amazing as it looks but really promising for spidey fans like me,1
167200,2624번,The Amazing Spider-Man,8,A lot of action,1
167880,2641번,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,8,I really enjoyed this movie  I thought it was original and entertaining  The first stories are very funny filled with black humor other parts were depressing and other parts included splendid landscapes  However it was quite violent for young teenagers  Violence is always very quick but bloody  Some scenes include a mans fingers getting blown out a man getting shot in the neck with an arrow a man getting scalped and others  The movie had no sex or nudity except for a prostitute getting hired for sex   It had very low quantities of alcohol or drugs  Some of the characters were barbaric violent but others were lighthearted optimistic and funny  I would really recommend this to fanatics of western movies and black comedies although not everything in this movie is comical,10
167881,2641번,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,8,film has no swearing  but some strong voilence makes it a 14  but definetley a disapointment from joel and ethan coen  its no big lebowski,2
167882,2641번,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,8,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs acts as an parody of classic Westerns while adding a unique twists on typical tropes  Like how Buster Scruggs  wares a white hat a typical sign in classic Westerns that this is the good guy  But he obviously loves killing to a point its frightening and he is not the good guy  While black hats mean the bad guy the Kid wheres one and he shows no real evil acts and in the end he and Buster sing together and become allies  Now not all of them are like this as James Francos segment is quiet but still action packed  Some depictions of  Native Americans Indigenous are racist they work well for the movie as it works with the hypercritical nature of the view of the old west  The third segment was the best by far as it showed emotional depth while there is barely a word spoken  The costumes and set design are phenomenal and everything culminating together this is a must watch,8
167883,2641번,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,8,This movie is pretty good  However I started to lose interest after the films fourth short film,2
167884,2641번,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,8,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a great film with six episodes in a two hour time space  It was made by the Coen Brothers  The only problem in this film is violence but if you can handle violence in movies or just remember its fake blood its all ok It should be fine for a twelve or thirteen year old,3
167885,2641번,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,8,Do not bother watching this repetitive boring unnecessarily gruesome disgrace of a movie  It is well acted but the whole story is without a plot theme or even a main character the trailer was really good and portrayed this film as being funny and an adventure but it was not in any way amusing and had no adventure,2
167886,2641번,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,8,Hilarious brutal sad and dark  Some graphic violence so best for mature 12 or 13  Thought provoking messages though,3
167887,2641번,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,8,Very good Coen Brothers quality  Starts out very funny and progressively gets darker  Pretty violent but not consistent and not overlygraphic as in a Tarantino film  Language is minimal  Some stories are better than others but overall very good  Occasionally confusing,6

168044,2653번,The BFG,8,I love this movie I cant say anything bad about it other than the fact that it could be a bit scary for younger a kids,1
168045,2653번,The BFG,8,Its okay overall there are some scenes of scares and mild violence,1
168046,2653번,The BFG,8,Youre going to think I am crazy for saying 9 and 2 stars but I watched this when I was what 7 or 8 and I didnt like it  It was scary sometimes and boring all the other times  I made it through the whole movie finally when I was 8 or 9 but I wasnt paying attention because it was SO BORING  UGH,5
168047,2653번,The BFG,8,I love the book for this movie just as much,1
168048,2653번,The BFG,8,Of course I love anything Roald Dahl inspired  The BFG is funny lighthearted and has the beautiful message of believing in yourself even if you feel small  Beware small children may be scared on the bigger giants who steal children from their beds and eat them,3
168049,2653번,The BFG,8,I love this movie especially when the Queens corgis go flying round and up the house,1
168050,2653번,The BFG,8,i read this book at school when i was 10 and i saw the movie when i ws seven years old this is an amazing book to read to kids and it is very entertaining,1
168051,2653번,The BFG,8,Boring and Confusing  This movie is so confusing only 11 would know whats going on  NOT A FAN,3
168052,2653번,The BFG,8,my mom thought the giants were a little bit scary but from my point of view it was a non scary silly adventurous movie,1
168063,2653번,The BFG,7,Its a great variation of the book  It has a bit of toilet humour but kids will love it A bit of scariness but not that much  I loved the slimy vegetables All in all it was pretty good,5
168064,2653번,The BFG,7,A bit boring but some bits can be funny the giant is well made and it seems real the acting rolls are not to bad depending on the scene,1
168065,2653번,The BFG,7,The movie is a great idea its perfect for children and even people who enjoy movies such as this its nothing like any other giant movie i hope youll like it as much as i did,1
168066,2653번,The BFG,7,This movie is amazing They just dont make movies like this anymore where it can be entertaining without cursing or inappropriate content  Pros funny no cussing animation is breathtaking plus the storyline is interesting for all ages  Cons a whole scene is dedicated to fart jokes but it was pretty funny though violence that can scare small children but besides that its a great movie,4
168067,2653번,The BFG,7,For me the movie was positively boring and not very exciting  For my mom and dad they thought it was great  It definitely was not what I expected based on the trailers however it has great heart and a positive message  Personally I would not recommend it especially for younger kids  I think younger kids would find it too thoughtprovoking and a bit too slow and lack of magic,5
168068,2653번,The BFG,7,the BFG was a very good movie If you have toddlers or 6 and below kids I prefer not to watch with them But otherwise sureAt times it can be dark or scary At others they teach you lessons or it can be funny,1
168069,2653번,The BFG,7,The BFG brings back to film industry to Steven Spielberg with a genuine work aimed at adults and infants that covets to has the same impact than the previous classics of the director nevertheless his film does not capture such pleasures,1
168070,2653번,The BFG,7,This is a lovely movie for families  Some scenes might scare young children under 7  It was a bit boring but very good  Worth seeing it,5
168959,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,Epic sequel has tons of actionviolence,1
168960,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,This is a great sequel and has a great plot but it is violent  There is also some swearing such as one use of fcking and a few uses of st dan and as,2
168961,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,The Bourne Supremacy  yeah its not brilliant in my opinion but its still a good action sequel and better than Identity with more action scenes but hopefully Ultimatum will be even better  There are some violent brutal scenes although not much blood and an Fword so Id recommend this for ages 13 and up  Not bad  An improvement on the soso first film,4
168962,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,This movie is pretty good  Its the second Bourne movie and I enjoyed it a lot,2
168963,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,The Bourne Supremacy improves from the previous movie by doubling up the thrills action and fun to make an even better sequel  This movie does have tons and tons of violence but same as its first movie it is fine for older Tweens and up,2

168965,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,This movie is brilliant  It is the second movie in the Bourne series  It is wellacted but pretty violent  Bourne is an easy model to root for although he beats up and kills potential assassins and injures innocent bystanders in a heartstopping car chase  One man shoots himself but we are spared the full gore  Another man gets stabbed by a fellow agent  Jason fights another man which ends up with strangulation  Jasons girlfriend is shot by an assassins bullet meant for him,8
168966,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,This is a pretty good movie with a hell lot of violence blood and killing  The language son of a b is normal,2
168967,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,The Bourne Supremacy is as outstanding as the first  With hard intense action which has my favorite scene in the film the fight is the house  It was gripping and realistic since there was no music in the background until it was over an excellent continuation of the story great acting from Damon and new additions Joan Allen Brian Cox and Karl Urban and John Powells score is great  Grade A,4
168968,2684번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,My ratingR for strong violence some racy content alcohol use and language throughout,1
169608,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,I watched this with my 12 year old cousin and he was fine the blood and gore is over the top but it is by unrealistic monsters it is a great film if you can handle blood,1
169609,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,Okay first of all I wanted to see this movie really badly  So I saw it  I hate this movie  I dont like movies when literally the whole thing is gallons and gallons of blood is just spurting out everywhere every 5 seconds  This movie is so stupid dont even think about wasting money to see this  Its pointless with pretty much no plot,6
169610,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,Cabin in the Woods doesnt go for the easy horror movie laughs that the Scary Movie franchise tries to elicit but it is a curiously interesting satire on why horror movies can be so cliched and ridiculous at times  The movie itself isnt too scary save for a few jump scares but its wit keeps it afloat and distinguishes it among other lesser flicks,2
169611,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,Cabin In The Woods had a great concept but I felt overall the actual movie was very weak and bland  Now on to the parents guide  I watched this movie knowing that it would have gore and language but I didnt know how gory this movie would be  It was pretty bad the first part of the film but about the last thirty minutes of the film it is a total gore fest  There was one scene where in about two minutes in one room monsters escape and grisly kill the men in the room and blood shoots on the roof and on the wall and floor and people are ripped in half and dismembered and decapitated and eaten all in one room the violence made me shiver and one of my favorite movies are kill bill so strongly caution with 14  there  is also one scene of nudity and tons of drugs and language,5
169612,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,As the title said Cabin in the Woods is very dark  It can be very disturbing at points to  It was very well written though and it has a lot of humor  I enjoyed it a lot  It is a very good new take on the horror genre,5
169613,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,The Cabin in the Woods adds new ideas to the horror genre which is falling apart it is visually stunning not that scary but the violence language sex and drinking makes it not recommended for under 15 this age specifically because it is more funny than scary but it has a lot,1
169614,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,I really enjoyed this movie and thought it was clever  I didnt like the drug use and sexuality in the movie there wasnt too too much but there was enough and I think the movie would have been better without it  The main thing about this movie is it is very gory and not good for kids and if your sondaughter can handle lots of blood and scary monsters its fine  If not then do not let them watch this it is very VERY gory,4
169615,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,I am not at all a fan of horror movies but I loved this movie  Its hilarious interesting and refreshingly original  I was 16 when I saw this and had no problems with it but wouldnt recommend it to anyone much younger than that,3
169616,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,The Cabin in the Woods definitely has a witty screenplay and is a smart horror comedy  It features excellent direction and some decent acting  Very original and unique but pause for kids fifteen and under  The film has some sexual contentnudity heavy language some smoking and drug use from a certain character and a large amount of violence  A,5
169617,2706번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,this movie scares me to death  i dont wanna watch itnot only that it is really scarybutit has innapropriate languageand i dont like itand theres drugs in it and i heard that drugs will make you really sicki hate this movie i wish movies like this were never invented,4
169676,2712번,The Case Against 8,8,My ratingPG13 for mature content and language,1
169701,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,I like a lot of Studio Ghibli movies but OMG this is the best The animation is so cute and like everyone else I fell in love with Baron Humbert von Gikkingen  Hes so dashing and handsome  Its  a short but sweet film and one of my top recommendations,4
169702,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,OMG best Ghibli film ever  I loved all the characters and everything was adorable  To be honest I fell in love with the baron  In my opinion best anime film ever,5
169703,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,This film was was extremely easy to watch and follow with the storyline being typical of a normal movie  I do just think that this is just a nice kidsfamily movie that you wont have any problems with  The Baron to me is a bit like Sherlock Holmes with his British accent and mannerisms the only thing I was a bit disappointed about was that the plot from Whisper of the Heartthe movie that The Cat Returns is a spinoff of isnt picked up with his missing girlfriend which is a shame  But if you havent watched the previous film then you dont need to worry about that also you dont need to have watched Whisper of the Heart to watch this film there isnt all that much that connects them  I liked the protagonist Haru she did have her assertive moments but then there were also moments where I felt like she was the damsel in distress which I thought went a bit against her character   This movie is suitable for everyone it has nothing upsetting or inappropriate in it and I could imagine myself liking it from as young as when I was in nursery  Overall this is just a heartwarming movie that to me is nothing all that original or differenthence the three star rating but would definitely be a nice one for kids or families to watch as a short fun film,7
169704,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,The Cat Returns is a very interesting movie The cats in my opinion are a little creepy but later in the movie I got used to them It has romance in it  which I didnt like Some cats get thrown out windows which is a little scary One of the main characters almost died and that also scared me But overall the movie is really funny and a good family movie,1
169705,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,The Cat Returns deserves five stars for its quirky characters cute cats and its theme  The main theme was definitely hidden and I found it  I noticed the characters seem to depend on if someone is cool or not  Haru the main character starts the movie with being late and gets in trouble  She is walking home from school and sees a cat in the street and a big truck is going towards the cat and Haru saves him with her lacrosse stick  Will Haru regret this decision when she finds out who she saved Will she regret listening to the whisper from above And will she regret Calling another cat Moota fat,8
169706,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,This is another lovely masterpiece from Ghibli This visually pleasing story about a girl who is swept away to the kingdom of cats after rescuing their prince is a hilarious adorable film that I would definitely recommend   Although there is a slight amount of adult humor that will go over kids heads it is one of the cutest and most memorable films of the genre  10 is quite extreme,4
169707,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,While The Cat Returns is Studio Ghiblis shortest feature film to date 11 mins shorter than My Neighbor Totoro its worth a watch if you like humour excitement and talking cats  ADVISORY Not much scariness or violence two cats have a short sword duel with no notable injuries the lower half of a tower is blown but the upper half doesnt collapse and noone on top or ground is hurt two cats are thrown out of a window but they are not seen getting hurt  Little to no swearing a character confesses she has a crush and the main storyline is about the main character being forced to marry a cat but there is absolutely no sex in the movie cats are seen drinking something in a feast but its not stated to be alcohol  The main positive message is about believing in yourself and accepting yourself as who you are  REVIEW This lesser known Studio Ghibli film surprised me positively with its lightness humour and simple but beautiful animation style  The characters are well done from Harus insecure awkwardness to the Barons gentleman calmness and Mutas flippant streetmans speech   While The Cat Returns lacks the high stakes breathtaking art and long running time of other Ghibli films sometimes its just relaxing to forget the world around you for little over an hour and dive into the magical nonsense of the Kingdom of Cats,7
169708,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,This films style is ridiculous and hilarious  It is about a teenage girl named Haru who saves a cat who then talked to her   She is then introduced by a bunch of talking cats to the Cat Kingdom  Along the way she meets a living crow statue and living humanoid cat mannequin  The movie is laughoutloud hilarious throughout  I could probably watch it again and again  Its hilarious because of the ridiculousness of the situations from talking cats showering Haru with gifts that only cats like and wanting Haru to marry the cat prince just for saving one of their cats and the dialogue that the cats engage in with Haru and each other  Its like My Neighbor Totoro with a lot of unintentional humor of the sobaditsgood type but it also has lots of intentional humor which is all good as well  The way they did the English dub wasnt half bad  It actually sounded like the way people would speak in English  The visual style was good too looking colorful the outlines being thin and the characters looking almost realistic  The storys plot wasnt too complex but it was still good  I was able to identify a clear threeact structure but it was fast paced and always funny  The characters are good  Theres the grumpy fat cat Muta the outofhismind Cat King the fish out of water Haru and many others  The story is good but the real standout is the humor  You have to see this movie to believe how good it is  One last thing Why is this movie called The Cat Returns When was the first time the cat came But thats just the title not the movie itself  Why did Common Sense give this movie a 10 rating Its perfectly fine for kids,22
169709,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,The cat returns is a fantasy adventure film in the classic studio ghibli mold  It has great characters and has a positive message about believing in yourself and helping others  There is some fantasy violence and mild peril but nothing too scary  If you like cats youll love this film,4
169710,2717번,The Cat Returns,7,The Cat Returns is a heartwarming epic adventure  There is a little bit of fighting a few cats are thrown out a window and muta  is shown stuck in a big bowl of catnip jelly  Haru talks about a crush on a boy and falls in love with Baron  Language is not a problem just some words like idiot and fatso,4

170357,2759번,The Devil Wears Prada,8,This movie is about fashion so kids may get bored in this movie  It doesnt Target audiences much but still a nice movie and the soundtrack is good,2
170358,2759번,The Devil Wears Prada,8,I loved this movie Its absolutely original and everyone casted was the best  If you dont appreciate or perhaps understand fashion you might find it boring  Theres a lot of clothing transformations and its all really nice for me,4
170359,2759번,The Devil Wears Prada,8,Fashion friends job and sx  Fun movie to watch with the family or a group of friends  Some cursing but nothing too serious  Occasional sx but only women in lingerie and topless men  All the characters are likeable and hilarious,5
170360,2759번,The Devil Wears Prada,8,This is a very good movie and I understand why it is pg13  There is some pretty strong language but no f bombs that I can remember  They character emily seems to have an eating disorderbody image issues  All of the people who work at runway have issues with body image and ridicule andy who is actually very healthy and beautiful for being a size 6  You should tell your kids that this is wrong  some sex also but no nudity  a few drinking scenes,7
170361,2759번,The Devil Wears Prada,8,Directed by David Frankel The Devil Wears Prada is a great story about finding who you really are  Starring Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway it combines comedy and drama into a meaningful film  What if a woman fresh out of college gets a job working for a highly successful fashion company Andy is fresh out of college and really wants to be a journalist in New York  She applies for a job for the fashion magazine Runway and under famous Miranda the chief editor of Runway  She miraculously gets the job despite her terrible fashion sense  Over time she gets busier and gradually makes her way up the ranks as an employee and as an assistant to Miranda,7

171355,2809번,The Founder,8,At first I really despised the ending  The ending showed how if you have perserverance you can crush other peoples dreams  I didnt like that because I thought they were celebrating it  But if you look at it like a cautionary tale its a mighty fun ride,4
171356,2809번,The Founder,8,I personally really liked this movie although it had words like F   KS   T and ass it had a strong message of persevere  and love,1
171357,2809번,The Founder,8,The movie The Founder is a very well made film about the coming of McDonalds  It is not the most charming story as the main character steals ideas and breaks contracts to get ahead and beat other people  Although it displays a message that you can do anything you can dream of at any age,3
171358,2809번,The Founder,8,Howit starts put as ray just selling his invention to him becoming more of a villian in the movie  He divorces his wife and puts the original mcdonalda out of business  Definitely puts a different eye on why not to go to mc donalds ontop of that its fake and unhealthy foods,3
171359,2809번,The Founder,8,I really enjoyed this movie  Though somewhat selfish and not a great role model Ray Kroc does show tremendous work ethic and perseverance and keeps fighting for his vision until it is realized  Overall the movie highlights the importance of hard work and never giving up,3
171360,2809번,The Founder,8,The reviews call it an ad for McDonalds not at all This movie shows the story of the founder of McDonalds a sleazy dirtbag who stole the company from the real founders and screwed them over in the process  SPOILERS,3

171672,2823번,The Good Dinosaur,7,Admiring dino learns positive messages,1
171673,2823번,The Good Dinosaur,7,BOO It was very boring dark and depressing nothing like the original Pixar movies  Arlo is a Wimp whining and asking his parents permission for every little thing  Spot cant Hulk out  Thunderclap is the worst villain ever  And the only thing that he loved was himself so throwing Arlos dad off a cliff to a river would do nothing  This scene is stolen from Mufasas death  You do not throw some one you truly love off a cliff It was and remains to this very day the worst movie I have ever seen  The only good part was the end,10
171674,2823번,The Good Dinosaur,7,Scared the snot out of me when I was little I would leave the room during the pterodactyls part  Scared me so bad  I literally would start crying when one of my family members put on this  movie,3
171675,2823번,The Good Dinosaur,7,It feels like getting trapped in a weird dejavu nightmare,1
171676,2823번,The Good Dinosaur,7,Ive never watched this movie but this is my least favorite Pixar movie It is boring childish emotional and a waste of time Maybe little kids are probably like it and teens are probably get bored  Okay the scene of Arlos dad dying stolen from Mufasas death in The Lion King The plot which is not good at all The pterodactyl IDR what is name was is a weakest Pixar villain ever And Arlo is quite not a good role model  Hes probably arrogant and annoying as possible  He was in the second place for the least good Pixar hero first being Merida  I only like is the animation because its beautiful releastic and its quite topnotch but this movie is trash And Spot which is a likable character  I really painful to look at is Arlo and Spot getting drunk  Its so weird I only watched this scene  When I was 9 saw the good Dinosaur for the first time merchandises and commercial I quite dont like it because its boring  Dont watch this movie because it is a waste of time and this Pixar movie is so unlikeable If you liked The Good Dinosaur your opinion will be respect so I understand  Edit For response to my supporter Dogcat  Thank you I really appreciate that you reviewed WALLE But youve never watched this  You saw this movie a little bit in elementary school but not remembered anything that much  I remembered this movie when I was a toddler seeing an advertisement in the theater but I thought it was childish  At 9 I only watched this scene of WALLE and EVE dancing in space  I thought EVE is a boy and a best friend and I dont know what her name is  I mistaken that EVE is WALLEs girlfriend Now since 13 I love it Not childish anymore Its awesome family film WALLE is one of my favorite Pixar movies ever and Im a fan I know all of the scenes I think youve never watched all of Pixar movies except Finding Dory Cars 3 and Inside Out  I think these movies youve never watched Up WALLE like you said before Finding Nemo Monsters Inc and amp Monsters University Toy Story movies A Bugs Life Coco The Incredibles Nadia Clouds favorite Pixar movie Ratatouille Brave Cars 1 and 2 and Soul  I would like to let me know if you watched or never watched these Pixar movies And have seen these movies before but never watched these  Thank you See ya ,38
171677,2823번,The Good Dinosaur,7,a lot of you said this movie was sad or scary but I was 8 when I saw this and I was so bored  I knew what death is and all that but I was so bored I couldnt focus on the violent parts or the story  Now that Im 13 contrary to what the bottom of my review might say I might rewatch this movie and possibly be able to focus on the story  If you or your kid friend parent or whoever wanted to see this film out of curiosity in terms of the trailer I would not reccomend watching this  This is kind of offtopic but I had the same reaction to big hero 6 but I was 6 at the time and like I said my reaction was same but I whined and complained things like waa and mommy Im not having fun  I didnt know boredom is a word And that movie might be better if there was a better explanation on what was going on to the kids  btw I did not understand what death is at age 6,6
171678,2823번,The Good Dinosaur,7,I saw this when I was seven  I adored dinosaurs so I was like Oh my goodness a dinosaur movie thats animated I need to see this So when we went on a holiday to Perth to see some of my family I thought that would be a perfect time it was still in cinemas So we booked in a time and then we arrived  Long story short I was slightly sick at the time so a lot more emotional  I pretty much never cry at movies and I didnt usually even way back then so yes you know where this is going I CRYED THROUGH THE LITERAL WHOLE ENTIRE MOVIE LITERALLY EVERY SCENE WAS DARK AND DEPRESSING AND IT DIDNT EVEN HAVE A HAPPY ENDING,7
171679,2823번,The Good Dinosaur,7,Well all and all this is a great movie to watch with your family   There are a couple scenes that are sad like a scene where he loses his dad in a flood  And in one scene a character rips a cute bugs head off  soo l would make this a pretty good movie,4
171823,2826번,The Goonies,6,I personally love this movie  Its one of the first 80s movies I saw and its very funny and the characters grow on you,2
171824,2826번,The Goonies,6,This movie is a bit scary but not terryifiying my 6 your old brother was a bit scared but liked it I rate this movie 7,1
171825,2826번,The Goonies,6,Great movie ok for tweens though there is a lot of bad language but it is funny but also is action becuase a boy is on a hunt for one eyed willies treasure a few scares though there are some good messages and is a fun family movie,1
171826,2826번,The Goonies,6,This film is a must see 80s classic the humour the thrills the iconic quotes  this film has it all made mostly for kids though there is some language and scary scenes,1
171827,2826번,The Goonies,6,I wanted this film when I was 11 and I was in Secondary school  I already know every word that they said and I understood everything  A character does pretend to hang himself in the beginning but nothing really happened  One of the main characters does trick a lady who isnt English that the family keep drugs and she will be locked up with cockroaches with no food or water but nothing happens And there is a bit of swearing and a statues penis gets broken and they try to glue it back on But the film shows friendship and loyalty to each other  It shows you cant get by in life if you dont have people looking out for you  Even if they annoy you all the time,6
171828,2826번,The Goonies,6,Great movie with great messages and role models I bit of swearing some kissing and one scene with a naked statue the criminals smoke a little and scary at some times,2
171829,2826번,The Goonies,6,its ok,1
171830,2826번,The Goonies,6,halarius and some language,1
171831,2826번,The Goonies,6,I watched this movie when I was about 8  I was an absolute wuss so Sloth is the only thing that scared me  Obviously it was made in the 80s so it should be rated PG13 because of swearing and sexual references  I dont think the swearing or innuendos are a problem because if they are young it will go over their heads and if they are older they are probably hearing it anyway  In the beginning there is a faked hanging and later a dead body and skeletons  Nothing really that I would say is supper worrisome,6
171832,2826번,The Goonies,6,This movie is so good but it has bad words like st andbullst and Andy kisses Brand ,1
171857,2826번,The Goonies,7,This Movie had talk of drugs in the beginning but also had swearing  I liked this Movie because it was funny to watch in 2018  The only complaint I have is you cant understand one of the kids  The kids name is Data,4
171858,2826번,The Goonies,7,Its an 80s movie and rating systems were different back then  Kids do inappropriate things and has mature themes  I like the adventure and the story  I just believe its more for older audiences,3
171859,2826번,The Goonies,7,This movie is awesome  I saw this movie when I was seven and my older sister was eight  I remember at the end of the movie her saying it was scary and yes it can be  If kids have a fear of strangers chasing them they might want to wait until they get older  Also there are a lot of scaring words so if you have an elevenyearold that is very immature wait until heshe is older and knows not to repeat them but there are no really bad words  There are a few kisses and scary scenes too  Recommended for mature tweens,7
171860,2826번,The Goonies,7,I havent seen this movie in a few years but when I was 6 years old all I remembered was that I was so obsessed with The Goonies after I watched it  Some reviews state that situations are inappropriate but from what I recall this was a brilliant adventure made for kids  Go watch this classic,3
171861,2826번,The Goonies,7,I watched this when I was 6 didnt understand some stuff,1
171862,2826번,The Goonies,7,A great movie to watch with the whole  family Beware  some language  All the main character are fighting for the right to keep there homes,2
171863,2826번,The Goonies,7,The Goonies was OK but there is swearing   Words used include shi and dam  There was a lot of editing mistakes I noticed as well  Also there were a few sexual scenes,4
171864,2826번,The Goonies,7,Curious to see the reviews on this movie I read a couple of them  I think the parents are overreacting   My mom bought this movie for us and we all had some good laughs They say sht 19 times but thats what every kid will here in the real world do dont make them live under a rock My mom was very glad she bought this movie because not many kids movies make me laugh This would probably be a PG13 movie nowadays but nonetheless a great funny movie the whole family can enjoy Many kids in my class love this movie For little kids most of the sex jokes and bad words just fly right over their heads usually its not clear what they mean and could be easily interpreted as something else that is not bad  Enjoy watching,9
171865,2826번,The Goonies,7,its a good movie,1
171922,2828번,The Grandmaster,8,My rating PG13 some intense violence,1
174596,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,,2
174597,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,I was OBSESSED with this movie It has quite a bit of violence but its not horrible  There is not that much swearing  The reason why I give 10 and up is because theres nothing horrible in this movie  If you like the series divergent you would like this movie A LOT,5
174598,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,The movie tells the story of Katniss Everdeen in a competition with 24 other contestants and only 1 can live  There is not much blood but some scenes are very violent and somewhat suspenseful  Katniss is a strong role model too,3
174599,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,Parents Katniss is one of the best role models I have ever seen   The movie is pretty violent though it is not afraid to show some blood  Critical This film is a thought provoking adventure about a future world which celebrates a battle to the death disguised as a reality show known only as the Hunger Games  The second hour is very intense THIS PART WAS RETARDED My only complaint is that it is too long before the titular conflict starts  Overall 4 65,5
174600,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,This is REALLY violent You better read the book or see the 2nd movie You see a LOT of blood and its more for like a 11 year old or a MATURE 10 YEAR OLD if you really LOVE your  9 year old  up kids dont watch this Its VERY scary but the Second movie is good 10 up can see catching fire D D,7
174601,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,I liked it when I watched it then I went to go see catching fire and now I hate this film along with Catching fire  The dumbest movies I have ever witnessed  Too violent sad and WAY too intense  But is there anything good about this movie Well I like the soundtrack and I can tell that it was very well edited and they did a great job on it  I just dont like it,6
174602,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,Its a great book full of emotions and struggles  I wouldnt recommend this for younger kids since its got mature themes,2
174603,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,There is a lot of violence  This is something to look into because the movie is really all about an event that is all out violence  There is some swearing and not too much but a bit of sexual content  There is also drinking  So before letting a 10yearold see this movie see what they can and cant handle,5
174604,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,The movie was as good as the book and almost have the same scenes as the book  You should really watch the movie first then read the book because when i try reading the book at age 10 it was kind of hard to understand so i decided to wait for the movie to come out and see what happens  I understand way better after seeing the movie so i read the book and now i understand everything But readers i dont recommend this movie to anyone under 15 because of the violence and the gore,4
174605,2870번,The Hunger Games,7,The movie is fine except at the beginning its really boring  There is some violence I dont really remember most of it but it wasnt too bad  Oh ya at one part the creepy dogs were scary  I think most kids would be ok with it if they can skip the kissing There is some kissing  I didnt have nightmares or anything from the movie  Its no worse than Iron Man and those movies  Almost the same for violence and action  I guess you just have to know if your kid would be ok with it  My mom and dad knew I would be ok,10
175443,2881번,The Incredibles,7,Yes I consider this a superhero movie because IRON MAN 3 a big name Marvel movie STEALS the plot point   Look at how much that made and youll know what Im talking about   It has some adult stuff in it but it will probably fly over the kids heads   Also your kid WILL BE addicted to superheros after this GUARANTEE,4
175444,2881번,The Incredibles,7,a really good cartoon,1
175445,2881번,The Incredibles,7,Cool,1
175446,2881번,The Incredibles,7,really good some sex and violence but this is one of not Pixars not little kids movies,2
175447,2881번,The Incredibles,7,The Incredibles is definitely worth your time  The plot and storyline is good the CGI is wonderful and the movie itself is just EPIC If youre a fan of action packed films or CGI youll probably love this,3
175448,2881번,The Incredibles,7,its good,1
175449,2881번,The Incredibles,7,Yep its incredible alright  I love this film  Great CGI perfect acting amazing writing and the plot is super creative and just VERY wellexucted sorry if I spelt that wrong,3
175450,2881번,The Incredibles,7,My favorite movie as a kid still to this day a huge superhero fan I have to warn u the robot will scare young kids  scared me but that didnt stop me from watching it   my only problem is the powers werent creative  they are the same as fantastic 4s,6
175451,2881번,The Incredibles,7,perfect,1
175643,2890번,The Iron Giant,7,Seriously CSM my 2yr old cousin watches this like every day and he loves it  Also what the hell is inappropriate about laxitives all it does is give you diarrhea and help with diets  What Im saying is that this movie is so great and appropriate that even the youngest children will probably love this,3
175644,2890번,The Iron Giant,7,Good and funny movie with happy and sad bits   Nice style of cartoons   Happy ending,3
175645,2890번,The Iron Giant,7,This movie is an absolute masterpiece  But it is quite dark but thats just one of the things that make it so good  It definitely stays true to its 1957 setting but it might not be appropriate for younger kids  The main protagonist is a 9 year old boy named Hogarth Hughes who befriends a giant robot from outer space  Although the robot is friendly the main antagonist a U S  government official named Kent Mansley is paranoid of him possibly due to the Cold War  There is a scene where Hogarth secretly slips chocolateflavored laxatives into Mansleys smoothie I think this was to ditch him   There is also another scene where a deer is shot and even a scene where Mansley uses Chloroform in Hogarth  The film also uses words like Hell and Damn  However there are also positive messages  For example Hogarth tells the Iron Giant things like Killing is Bad Guns Kill You are who you choose to be and Souls dont die  At the end Mansleys paranoia causes him to launch a missile that he later finds out spells certain doom on the whole town  As the town looks up in the sky knowing they are just mere minutes from death the Iron Giant decides to sacrifice himself by flying into the missile before its even close to the ground in a very emotional scene saving the town  6 months later the Iron Giant is revealed to be starting to be selfrebuilt right before the movie cuts to black  Its an amazing film but might not be suitable for little kids  Its also a perfect illustration of 1957 USA,15
175646,2890번,The Iron Giant,7,A boy finds this creature from outer space teaches it about the world tries but fails to convince anyone about his discovery and later the government attempts to hunt down the creature  E T  the ExtraTerrestrial right Yes and no  Though very similar and a lot less content worries The Iron Giant set in the 1950s when the Russians had just deployed the Sputnik into space distinguishes itself from E T  by one 100 ft  metal man,6
175647,2890번,The Iron Giant,7,Huh  I seem to have a very long pattern of liking cartoons on the front where the animation can seemingly cover up the plot holes bad voice acting generic storyline e t c  When you start to put aside the animation and put a supreme focus on pure quality you may relook at youre favorite movies and go Wow  This has gotten a LOT worse  I mean a LOT worse  This seems to be somewhat of a normality among todays audiences and this is 2015 so maybe as much as everyone loves it they will relook at Inside Out and say   Okay maybe thats a bit too much  There are some cartoons however that are so dated that its much much easier to look at the very apparent flaws in the movie and not love it in the first place  At this point this is where The Iron Giant is doomed  Sure it may have lasted a little to make enough money for the Warner Bros to continue and such whereas even the current movies will be looked down at eventually but old movies such as Citizen Kane have so much to fall back on even if it is outdated the smart acting stellar storyline fantastic directing I could go on forever  These arent the movies that become outdated but The Iron Giant really doesnt have that to fall back on  The characters are rather traditional and really pushes it to see how moral they can go before it becomes something of a school project to induce good morals which isnt a good thing in movies where the adults have been over that and want to see quality  So youngsters may enjoy it and that alone would be a fair reason to go out and see it but there are even more primary flaws to come The voice acting is also the cheesy moral thing and the animation is very choppy not detailed and supremely 2Dish  The storyline also doesnt do anything creative  Its a lot easier to look over the flaws of a movie if the cartoon aspect doesnt affect you so maybe I should start rewatching as well  But although not too quality the young children maybe five or six adding to the fact that only a bit of peril will not bother them might not be as affected by the issues that make this movie as problematic as it is  Itll actually be one of their favorites if the parents are open to a bit of peril and notatallbadviolence which they probably will be  Movies0000,18
175648,2890번,The Iron Giant,7,It was a lot different from the usual movies either princesses or super heroes always are the majority of the viewers  This movie was a very interesting one and teaches good lessons to children,2
175649,2890번,The Iron Giant,7,I think its a really sweet touching story that the whole family will enjoy and it is very funny in some parts  I definitely recommend it  Its awesome,3
175650,2890번,The Iron Giant,7,this is a very good movie but the end is sad and used to make me cry when i was little,1
175651,2890번,The Iron Giant,7,I am 7 years old and I really really did not I repeat did not like it at all   beucause I think that it was incredibly sad a specially beucause of the end and the scene with the deer,2
175756,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,This film nails it right on the head as far as quality goes and even though its not a musical they do homage to a few of the songs e g  Bare neccities I wanna be like you Trust in me   Unlike the animated classic it is more entertaining and has more of a plot  And the CGI is beautiful as well  Share Khan was AWESOME Oh and he was quite intimidating as well and kills at least one character  Kaa is kind of creepy but her scene was awesome no WinneThePooh voice instead Scarlett Johansten  Overall very fun film,8
175757,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,The actor who played Mowgli is so talented and telling from the fact that he was the only human actor shown on screen he did absolutely amazing  The special effects are terrific to    You can barely tell on most animals that they are not real In some scenes it is very quiet but then something very surprising happens which can make you jump  Thats why I think that kids 9 and up would enjoy it better since they are used to movies that may be a little more intense,4
175758,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,The Jungle Book is about how Mowgli Neel Sethi has to find his way back to the man village as a fearsome tiger named Shere Khan Idris Elba is on the hunt for him  The Jungle Book is a film that I feel is  too charming and joyful to not like  There are some moments where i was on the edge of my seat or biting my nails or jumping when Shere Khan is on screen popping up everywhere  The voice talents are amazing my personal favorite being Idris Elba as Shere Khan,4
175759,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,I recently watched this at the theaters on a special outing with my grandparents  Though it is targeted toward a younger audience I thought it was a excellent movie for any age full of excitement fun and a lesson on learning to be who you are  Standalone actor Neel Sethi the young lead protagonist took it all on himself and surprisingly did a amazing job  I say at least four stars,4
175760,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,You can really tell that its just a kid in a green room the whole time because the acting is really weak  None of the reactions from Mowgli feel genuine and why would they Special effects are stunning of course  Bill Murray was Bill Murray and Christopher Walken was great as the enormous fleshy orangutan king,4
175761,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,This movie is really fun and the graphics are really cool   The panther bear and wolves looked so cuddly    There is no language that I remember hearing   There are a few parts that are scary when the giant monkey chases him and captures him and when Sheer Khan the tiger is chasing him and threatening to kill him   It would scare a younger audience but when I went there with my 11 year old friend she loved it   I did not like the monkey because his singing was really annoying   There are two songs in the movie   The monkey sings a song and then Bear Necessities is sang   There is a lot of clean humor that much younger kids would not understand but I thought it was funny   There are a few parts that are intense and make you jump but all in all it was a great movie,10
175762,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,A word of advice if youre seeing this film  dont be holding anything that could spill  You will jump out of your seat  I promise  The movie isnt all that bad though  It had some gorgeous animation and a really sweet story,5
175763,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with this one  The trailer looked gorgeous but of course theres always the chance that the movie doesnt live up to the advertisement I couldnt be more wrong  The very first scene begins with a chasetraining of some sort and it immediately captured my attention  I didnt particularly love the young actor who portrayed Mowgli at first but he eventually began to grow on me  The cinematography is beautiful the animals are realistic the battles scenes between the animals keep you wonderfully sitting on the edge of your seat  Even if you arent familiar with the story of The Jungle Book classic you can still enjoy this film  Theres quite a bit of violence throughout the film such as the animals attacking each other but I wouldnt consider it an unnecessary to the movie  Its a film both children and adults will love and the high ratings that its received is by no means an overstatement  I would encourage you to go see it  Its probably the best film Ive seen this year,9
175764,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,Parents should be aware that this version of The Jungle Book is darker more intense and scarier than the original 1967 picture  It is an amazing visual experience the CGI is incredibly realistic and the green screen is flawless  This enhances the viewing but also makes the fight scenes scarier  A very minor amount of blood can be seen just a few cuts and bruises and the fight between animals feature loud sound effects clawing biting but no blood  One death will hit hard as it happens very quickly and has a jump scare  Speaking of jump scares there are three or four of them in The Jungle Book  Children under 8 wont be able to handle them  The film has some serious gritty moments but also some very fun and joyful moments songs jokes etc   It is an amazing experience with Oscar worthy visual effects stellar voice acting Ben Kingsley Scarlett Johanson Idris Elba and humour  Children under 8 may need to cover their eyes for 1 or 2 scenes but not often,10
175765,2901번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,ModarateViolencescary scenesperilupsetting scenes  Very mild language  However the film is about friends and teamwork but the are explained through emotional moments,3
175976,2904번,The Karate Kid,8,I think that most kids can definitely watch this although younger kids might find it boring  It does have some fight scenes so if your child is sensitive to violence this may not be a good pick  It really just depends on your child  I think its a great movie,4
175977,2904번,The Karate Kid,8,i think this is awesome,1
175978,2904번,The Karate Kid,8,Great movie with lots of positive messages  The violence in this movie is not too much for kids to tolerate  Daniel is a great role mode though this movie has some faults  Like the movie writer seems to think that girls are weak and cant defend themselves  One example of this is when Mr  Miygi said to Daniel that he was Punching like a girl  Over all a great movie that has some flaws,6
175979,2904번,The Karate Kid,8,Mr Myagi teaches Daniel Kung Fu so he can defend himself the next time he gets bullied at school  Then Daniel goes to a karate competition and gets hurt really badly in the knee but gets back up  Then in the final round Daniel goes up against the one who shows no mercy for Daniel  His name is Johnny  Daniel does what Mr Myagi taught him and wins,5
175980,2904번,The Karate Kid,8,The Karate Kid is an amazing movie that the whole family  from little kids to grandparents  can enjoy  The violence is little and is used in the Karate scenes and one bullying scene in which you see a little blood  Swearing is also little with only a few bad words such as damn and basterd  The racist term slope is also used  One of our villains Johnny is rolling a joint in one scene but that will fly right over kids heads  There is nothing sexual in the film except for a lengthy kiss  The message in this film is also great and Mr Miyagi is a huge role model,7
175981,2904번,The Karate Kid,8,Ok soooo the actual movie is rated 15 England because of drugs and violence some sexual stuff but highschool era,1
175982,2904번,The Karate Kid,8,A classic movie that is appropriate  for kids This website tends to stretch its reviews so basically most kids can hardly watch anything  I that the goal anyway I think this movie is awesome and any kid can see it maybe not really little kids but otherwise everybody,4
175983,2904번,The Karate Kid,8,I think this is a great movie  But it is still best for older kids  The violence is generally mild but there are bruises on faces a small amount of suggestive themes as well as some use of mild language and less inappropriate insults such as bullst the GD word the D word frigging and bastd  But one thing parents and kids can talk about is not everything is the way it seems  Anyway this is a great movie that I would highly recommend for martial arts fans,4
175984,2904번,The Karate Kid,8,This film has heartwarming moments as the main character Daniel bonds with an unlikely friend and mentor mr Miyagi  Mr Miyagi works as a janitor but he can pull a punch  Having found out that mr Miyagi is a karate master Daniel requests training after numerous beatings by Johnny the school bully who has a black belt in karate  Meanwhile he develops a relationship with Johnnys exgirlfreind Ali  All in all I think this is a suitable film for most ages and in my view the best movie ive ever seen,5
177126,2959번,The Lion King (1994),6,I was watching this movie a little while ago and i said i think i might rewind and watch it again  i think in my life i have watched this movie over 4000 times its soooo good     i would reremend this movie to 5,3
177127,2959번,The Lion King (1994),6,Extremely good yet sad and scary for young kids,1
177128,2959번,The Lion King (1994),6,this movie was really good in 3D but some parts would be too scary for younger kids   like near the end there is some fighting which was kind of scary but it was really good,2
177129,2959번,The Lion King (1994),6,I think its absurd that any parent would find this movie inappropriate for kids above 4  I watched Lord of The Rings when i was 6 and I wasnt scarred for life  I definitely didnt need therapy,3
177130,2959번,The Lion King (1994),6,I think the original Lion King is great,1
177131,2959번,The Lion King (1994),6,The film is good quite a bit of violence and lots of scary scenes but note this film was NOT released 2011  It was released far before that  Its only been rereleased in cinemas  Please get your classics right,4
177132,2959번,The Lion King (1994),6,This is my favorite movieand I  think it is fairly educational because of the animals and naturejust as long your kids are able to understand it,1
177133,2959번,The Lion King (1994),6,I give it a G,1
177134,2959번,The Lion King (1994),6,I like this movie,1
177288,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,Yall really need to lighten up on this movie  Ariel has cleavage but guess what Its barely any its not explicit and shes a 16 year old wearing a shell bra  She has a chest  Grow up  Shes not really a good role model given the whole you need to be pretty to get the guy thing but this is a classic Disney movie made with the classic Disney formula  Cinderella doesnt get the guy until she transforms but I dont see anyone talking bad about her  Anyway the only genuinely iffy thing is basically Ursulas character  She eats live sea creatures in  a scene keep in mind this is basically cannibalism in this world Ursula calls Ariel a tramp when she Ariel is successfully impressing Eric and Ursulas death is actually pretty dark for a Disney movie but nothing your kids probably cant handle  Theres also a scene with a shark at the beginning of the movie  Overall this movie is fine for kids and the parents on this site are honestly ridiculous,11
177289,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,This is a sexylovey doub movie involving Areil and,1
177290,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,The movie that relaunched Disney and started the Disney Renaissance a period where some of the best Disney films are considered to have been made is none other than The Little Mermaid one of the most beloved Disney films made   The story of a young but rebellious teenage mermaid who strikes a deal with an evil sea witch to   ah youll find out   Just make sure you see this one if youre a Disney fan,3
177291,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,This is such a good movie Im probably older than I should be to watch Disney princess movies but nothing will ever beat the Little Mermaid  I wasnt going to write a review but some of the ones I saw  from  overly sensitive parents are ridiculous  There is no way that I would ever want to raise my child in a world where The Little Mermaid is,4
177292,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,one of my favorite Disney movies to date  Great soundtrack some humor and great animation totally worth watching,2
177293,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,I love this movie From the songs to the loveable characters to the hopeless romantics out there  I adored this movie,3
177294,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,Teaches kids to explore the world and there is a lot out there  But there is some innuendo,2
177295,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,This is an AWESOME movie Ariel is a positive role model for everyoneeven boys  She teaches us to stand up for what we believe in  Eric is a positive role model because 1 He is not full of himself 2 During the firebirthday scene he shows that he LOVES his dog Max  He went back into the fire and he risked his life just so he could save Max,5
177296,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,this disney movie has AWFULL role models and a DISGUSTING message  The movie shows ariel disrespecting her father never listening to him and causing trouble she changes herself to be with a prince come on is that really a lesson we want kids to see  and just so you know in the original book where the little mermaid was based on for the movie ariel DIES so this movie is bad please dont show it to your kids changing your body is not a lesson we want to give them,3
177297,2963번,The Little Mermaid,7,very scery ursula is very scery i didint even finish it,1
177316,2963번,The Little Mermaid,4,Honestly some of you parents need to calm down  Those who say shes not wearing enough clothes really Shes a mermaid do you expect her to wear a T shirt And as for she liked Eric just for his looks 1  She saw he had a passion for music like she did and 2  When he recieved a statue of himself for his birthday he made a disgusted face showing he wasnt vain or full of himself  The music is absolutely stunning and in no way sexual like some of you freak parents are saying  One of Disneys best movies that I love even though Im almost 13,8
177317,2963번,The Little Mermaid,4,This is one of the fine movies ever  Ariel is good  She reminds me of the time I was swimming during August  Ursula is the witch who has won the lottery  She has Ariels voice for good which is bad for infants  Eric is beautiful He loves Ariel  Flounder is a comedy fish who teases on Scuttle  Fine movie,9
177318,2963번,The Little Mermaid,4,This film sends out a great message that if you set your mind to something you will succeed,1
177319,2963번,The Little Mermaid,4,My fav movie of all time  I watch it all the time and it never gets old  Those kids who think that her outfit has to much cleavage then u should watch ballroom dancing cause that is too much cleavage not Ariels dresses  They are just normal outfits  And this movie is one of the best classics out there  I know her songs by heart and know all the lines  I say this movie should be for all ages because it has a lesson learn some risk in life are worth taken that is the real moral and that what the creators of the little mermaid was going for  Unlike mordern Disney movies The Little Mermaid touches hearts of ppl of all ages  It has that sort of spark to it please let your kids see the movie  They would love it  I know I did when I first saw it and I still love it,11
177320,2963번,The Little Mermaid,4,The Little Mermaid is like a SAW cartoon,1
177321,2963번,The Little Mermaid,4,I LOVE the Little Mermaid But when I was reading the reviews I noticed that some parents find that Ariels clothing choice isnt good  I mean really Do you want her to go around in a turtle neck I think you all are over protective of your kids they have to grow up sometime  You probably dont even let them watch Elmo  They probably have to watch the movie on ABCs all the time  Come on This is a great movie Ariel is a strong young woman who inspires girls to do what they believe in  Its either this or what they will find out online  Disney wouldnt make any movies too scary,12
177322,2963번,The Little Mermaid,4,why does everyone thinks its inappropiate 17 and older really this movie is for 6 year olds it does not teach girls to show off their bodies shes a mermaid what else is she going to wear a Tshirt this is a good movie for little kids if your daughter watches this its not like theyll what their belly button showing and what to wear tight clothes parents are to picky about what there child watches,1
177323,2963번,The Little Mermaid,4,this is a great movie for kids but my daughter always want to be like ariel lol,1

177470,2988번,The Man from Snowy River,8,Review The Man from Snowy River,1
177471,2988번,The Man from Snowy River,8,I recall watching this with my family multiple times as a child and loving the idea that this movie presents  There is some swearing which was a little unnecessary but I never picked up on it as a kid and only realized the cussing when I last rewatched it  There are a few kisses Three I think which never bothered me or my family but it may others  A few of the characters get drunk but are so tipsy that they only made a fool of themselves and the main character Jim looks down on them so it is not seen as a good thing  another character smokes a cigarrete but the result is having horse dung thrown on his shoe and is also shown as a bad thing and Jim tells him something smart about how stupid the choice to smoke was,5
177472,2988번,The Man from Snowy River,8,One time in the movie a guy calls a nother guy a basterd,1
178468,3015번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,Other reviewers have already given a good overview but I have a few notes to add,1
178469,3015번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,This is a FANTASTIC movie to watch as a family it really shows deeply people need to unplug from media and is well made  Some of the song choices are    odd and also ONE ANNOYING THING THE KIDS VOICE SOUNDS LIKE AN ADULT  THIS LITTLE BOY SOUNDS LIKE HE IS 30,4
178470,3015번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,It uses a basic premise and mixes it with an innovative animation style a few character dynamics and tropes that arent seen in cinema often and a realistic family conflict,1
178471,3015번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,I lovee this movie  Its very funny  A few tears of laughter may escape you  It is perfect to see with the family,4
178472,3015번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,First off this movie has great representation of LGBTQ people with the main character being hinted as lesbian through the movie finally revealing at the end of the movie Also Autism representation The son is likely to be autistic although it is never actually said  with extreme obsessions with dinosaurs and misunderstanding social cues  Also the movie critiques consumerism and capitalism in the digital age through hilarious gags,4
178473,3015번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,When I thought about watching this I was sorta like OMG this is going to be 35 stars  BUT I was WRONG This thrilling animated adventure about a family surviving through the robot appocalypse is a beautiful example of teamwork scifi and comedy  Buckle your seat belt for hilarious actionsequences and one crazy family as they drive across the country to save the world,4
178474,3015번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,The Mitchells vs the Machines was a really amazing animated film  It had great characters and the animation was absolutely refined  Surprisingly the film was made by the same studio that made The Emoji Movie  I recommend this for ages 10 and up because some scenes can be frightening to some viewers  Just wow,5
178475,3015번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,Well for a movie enthusiast who loves watching all sorts of films would say this TRULY is one best movies Ive Seen In Years The Mitchells vs the Machines is a Great Funny Family Film that would be great for all AGES  I think even as a 14 year old I find this film better than most of the Pixar Movies  It truly is a MustSee Film to Watch,4
178759,3037번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,I watched this since I was like 5 but it scared me until I was 12  I was seriously horrified and couldnt watch this is Halloween without having nightmares for weeks  Now as a 14 year old I love all the tim burton movies with my whole heart,3
178760,3037번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,its fine   I like how its stopmotion and that its directed by henrey selik who also directed Coraline aka the greatest most amazing beautiful emotional fantastic masterpeice which im watching right now   In other words go watch Coraline instead,3
178761,3037번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,The Nightmare before Christmas is such a great Tim Burton movie and for those who says its scary inappropriate and creepy youre crazy  Rebecca Spark is Crazybutt This film has the incredible luxury of being a holiday film that is viewable for TWO different holidays or year round if you desire  It is shown on TV during October and December and occasionally November as well  Been heard of Henry Selick directed this movie he also directed Coraline  I saw it since when I was 7 watching Haunted Mansion holiday and I watched both Henry Selick films  Even I watched Corpse Bride I drew both Emily and Sally and both are Tim Burton  Holly R have been a fan of watching this movie since she was 5 and it was still newish  It takes a special kind of smaller child to not feel scared of everything in todays world but this has just the right amount of scares and humor  Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King and a mascot for Halloween who is becoming tired of the same old Halloween stuff every year  He stumbles across the world of Christmas and becomes intrigued by Santa and all the happiness that is in Christmas so he decides that he wants to be Santa  Its a fun spooky and jolly holiday movie with a Oogie Boogie Man who isnt really scary because he is just a sackbag that has eyes and a mouth  He has bugs inside his body  He might scare very sensitive children but if your kids are not sensitive and can handle similar movies like Corpse Bride then by all means this is for them  The stopmotion animation is great good plot great music cool ghoul characters and some characters are good role models especially Sally  I like when he explains Christmas  My favorite scene is when Fanfavorite Jack disguises as Sandy Claus and pranks all children for presents  Its funny Though Disney plus have parental guidance when you played the movie  I have a art teacher who is a fan of Tim Burton  I recommend for ages 7 because of some scenes can be frightening for sensitive younger viewers but older can handle it  Great Tim Burton,22
178762,3037번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,This movie has a great story and great animation  It has a tad bit of violence but other than that it is a wonderful film  The characters are great and the story is perfect  This is one of Disneys best films  No language or anything inappropriate  Great film over all,6
178763,3037번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,Parents need to know that unlike most Tim Burton films this movie is for kids  Some stuff that might creep out kids such as ripping off arms spiders bats and monsters  One character opens up his head  Wonderful family movie,4
178764,3037번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,There is nothing wrong with it and the claymation is beautiful  the main character does try to steal christmas but sees the error of his ways   The people in halloween town are all monsters but none of them are scary  the main character is a skeleton and he takes off his head once or twice,4
178765,3037번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,Really good movie,1
178766,3037번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,This is a great movie but kinda gross  Theres a song at the start the shows a load of creepy deformed monsters singing about Halloween  Good movie but 5 and below need to wait one or two years for some of it,3
178767,3037번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,Good thing it was rated PG   It was scarier than I thought   Kids should be 8 to watch it alone 7 to watch it with an adult   If kids dont like scary stuff then dont watch this movie,4
179151,3047번,The Office,7,This show is possibly the best comedy ever There is light cursing damn hell bitch ass crap and there are a few drug references Dwight finds a joint in the parking lot Ryan gets addicted to cocaine both are played for laughs lots of sex references and talk of genitals and finally a small amount of violence  Its all played for laughs but some younger kids could imitate some of the dumb stuff Michael Dwight and Andy do  Jump off a building into a box throw scissors at each other throw watermelon at cars off the top of a building  The show is hilarious and I would 100 recommend it to anyone,5
179152,3047번,The Office,7,often offensive show that holds up in some areas and plunges head first in others  your child has to be mature enough to understand the weight of some of the jokes and has to know that many of the jokes are offensive and that some of the actual beliefs behind the jokes are dangerous to actually believe in,2
179153,3047번,The Office,7,The Office is a great show  There are a fair number of inappropriate jokes and references so if you were going to watch solo I would recommend for 12  However if an adult will watch with you I would okay it for 1011 year olds as well  My 10 year old sister and I watched it with our mom and it was fine  However before letting your 10 year old watch it you should know that there are several thats what she said jokes as well as a few about race and sex there are several references to sex and having sex one of the characters Meredith is an alcoholic some characters smoke and there is some language  Anything too inappropriate is bleeped out but there are damns and dammits as well as a few other not so nice words  If none of the above is an issue for you then great let your kid watch The Office,7
179154,3047번,The Office,7,My brother used to watch The office before after it leaves Netflix USA at the end of the year and its available on peacock now  I watched it because its not that badly after they talk about sex theres swearing like sort of st nor maybe some dirty stuff words but some F bombs may be use in this show right now  OK for 14 or 15 should be watchin this,3
179155,3047번,The Office,7,I love this show and think that it is totally appropriate to kids 13 and up  But it is a bit awkward to watch with parents,2
179156,3047번,The Office,7,Most mature jokes just go over your head  Some episodes are inappropriate with sx jokes and racy jokes but overall its an amazing comedy romance and family show,2
179157,3047번,The Office,7,I love this show but there are some not safe for work  jokes however Evan though my rating says 12 but it really depends if your child has been through 7th grade health  education,1
179158,3047번,The Office,7,This is the absolute funniest show Ive ever seen the characters are relatable yet hilarious great plotlines for a comedy lots of  great improvision starts to decline once sabre purchases Dunder Mifflin still hilarious ending was great,1
179159,3047번,The Office,7,iffy but funny and good,1
180556,3080번,The Polar Express,6,This was not a good movie  I watched it as a teenager and even found it too creepy I would think little kids would be terrified  It is very unrealistic the conductor is mean and irresponsible and it included many unnecessarily scary sceens ghost on roof puppet room train out of control lost ticket even the beginning with the shaking as the train arrives  Our family watched it thinking it would be a cheerful and holiday movie for young children but it was creepy   Not even the elves were cute The only thing that was relatively sweet about the movie was the friendship between the three kids and the messages of kindness and friendship  I wasnt scared but I would imaging young children would be quite scared its not a good movie for little kids  I would recommend that nobody regardless of age watch the movie,8
180557,3080번,The Polar Express,6,This movie is a great movie for all ages it shows all the importance in christmas than  just getting gifts  and santa  Christmas is jesuss birthday and should teach you the importance in family life,2
180558,3080번,The Polar Express,6,in the boys house there is never light just dark and the train is way too loud  Please dude gimme a better movie,2
180559,3080번,The Polar Express,6,This film contains positive messages role models  THE POLAR EXPRESS is a fun movie for kids aged 6 and up,2
180560,3080번,The Polar Express,6,You shouldnt be worried about this AT all no bad language no other stuff and any intended scariness is just yelling with anger  This was the first movie I watched when I was 2 and I still love it Great role models and messages of the right thing to do not only for yourself but to help other people too,3
180561,3080번,The Polar Express,6,I love the positive message and the roles that family play in this film   I loved the characters and the story about traveling on an express train to the north pole and going through some twist and turns just to be the first kid ever to receive the first gift,2
180562,3080번,The Polar Express,6,My all time favorite christmas movie,2
180563,3080번,The Polar Express,6,This is the best Christmas movie ever Me and my family watch this every year  I always feel like I am on Christmas Eve night when I watch this movie and it makes every kid ready for the night before Christmas  It teaches a lesson about how you do not need to see something to believe in it  You should believe in something because you feel it is right  It also teaches the true meaning of Christmas and shows the time spent with family and all the Christmas activities  This is my favorite movie ever I would recommend this to everyone Please give yourself a great Christmas treat and go watch it right now,9
180564,3080번,The Polar Express,6,greatest movie ever great christmas film for little kids  five stars up but only at christmastime,4
181000,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,This movie is not remotely bad  The stakes are always high and Wesley the protagonist befriends many previous enemies including Inigo Montoya who is out for revenge  His father was killed by a man with six fingers on one hand  He practices a phrase every day  Wesley also befriends Fezzick a giant man who helps Wesley in every way possible  Princess Buttercup is being forced to marry against her will so Wesley Inigo and Fezzick go on a long quest to rescue her from Prince Humperdink and the six fingered man  There is no swearing but there is a small amount of drinking,7
181001,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,I will say  I get scared easily by movies  But I think that this movie has too much violence  Bad people put a good man into a torture machine the princess is planning to commit suicide a man sticks a knife into anothers stomach This movie gave me nightmares for a while after I saw it   Not a bad movie unless youre too young when you watch it and then its just awful,4
181002,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,This movie is one of my favorites Its not to violent and its great Barely to little sex a man makes a comment about a princesss breasts will go over kids heads the swearing is very mild Jesuss name is misused once briefly    Son of a btch used once  I would say WITH PARENTS a six year old could watch it  Keep in mind its rated PG,7
181003,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,Very entertaining and funny  Quite a lot of kissing though,2
181004,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,This is one of the best movies of all time Cary Elwes is the BEST in this movie  Other than men in tights If anything I would say its kind of violent  In the Fire Swamp the princess dress gets on fire but it is quickly put out with nobody injured  In the same scene Wesley Cary Elwes is attacked by an ROUSRodent of unusual size and bit twice by a giant rat that might seem a little scarey  Once in the arm and another time in the shoulder  He screams in pain and eventually sets the rat on fire  It moans and Wesley stabs it three times to put it out of its misery  Wesley and the princess share quite a few passionate kisses  A bad guy is poisoned but it is very silly   Lots of talk of torture  One reference to the princess breasts  Iningo Montoya gets stabbed at least three times  Then he stabs his enemy at least three times and kills him  Two torture scenes in the pit of despair  Son of a btch is used once  God a few times  All of this may sound bad but its not  Its also a FANTASTIC  MOVIE,20
181005,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,Many people have told me that The Princess Bride was perfect the best film of all time and a classic  Did it live up to the hype For me it did not  On a technical basis it could have been improved  One of the biggest problems I had with this film was the pacing  By that I mean how elaborate it was  When Buttercup and Wesley were reunited we get to see more of their relationship but that quickly ends and kinds of sabotages the romance which is not good since this is kind of a romance film  The next problem I had with the movie was the consistency of tone  At one point of the movie it was very kidfriendly then towards the end it got bloody  I questioned if I was still watching the same movie and this problem was one of my biggest issues with the movie Hook  I might be coming off as a hater of The Princess Bride but I assure you I dont hate this movie  I really enjoyed the comedy the movie had some solid performances and characters the movie had a cool story of rescuing and the swordfights were choreographed really well  Ill give The Princess Bride a 6 510  I was underwhelmed by this movie and I was hoping to give the movie an 1010  This kind of thing happens from time to time  I recommend The Princess Bride to children mostly,16
181006,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,This is an unbelievable movie and so good  However there are two sword fights one which involves quite a few cuts and stabs and the eels might scare some young children  Some of the humor is a little adult and there are a few instances of mild swearing  Allinall though it is an amazing movie that anyone over 8 will absolutely love,4
181007,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,This was a pretty good movie  It was REALLY funny at some parts  It was strange because some parts felt to fast and others to slow  The romance was nice but it was definitely fairytale Not real  I didnt really feel or see any personality in the characters  buttercup was a damsel in distress who sort was just there to be rescued  Westley had personality and I liked him well enough  the three bad guys two who werent really bad were fun  I didnt really see the point in the prince wanting to kill buttercup I think it was another part of the damsel in distress thing  But I really did like the movie,10
181008,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,Great film that is a different kind of princess story but still so much fun to watch  Funny and exciting I recommend this movie to all children 6 and up,2
181019,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,Princess Bride was one of those movies I kept hearing about and it seems you arent a real movie buff unless you watch it  I can tell its infinitely quotable to those who grew up watching it but the enormous rats even scared me so kids above 10 should have no problem seeing it  Very clever especially with the hilarious Andre the Giant,3
181020,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,The Princess Bride is an 80s classic for good reason   its nearly perfect  Our protagnist is Buttercup a young woman who loves to torment her farm boy Westley   who only replies As you wish to her every command  Later she realizes he loves her and she loves him too  When Westley is sent to war and killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts Buttercup grieves  An evil prince takes advantage of this by choosing her for his bride  However shes kidnappedand a villain named Vizzini attempts to murder her but the Dread Pirate Roberts saves her  Buttercup is annoyed because of what happened to Westley but why does he seem so familiarThere is lots of sword fighting and the scene in the fire swamp might be intense for the youngest viewers  A use of son of a b is used and as Buttercup contemplates suicide Westely mentions her perfect breasts  The comedy in this movie along with the action the romance and the fantays make it a big success  I particulary enjoy Billy Crystal as the wizard Andre the Giant as Fezzik the giant and Wallace Shawn as the evil Vizini,10
181021,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,I thought it wasnt a very good movie but it had a good plot line  Although it would be a great movie for children there was a couple of moments in the movie where there was some language and really spoiled the movie  Therefore I think that you should not be allowed to watch this if you are 7 or under and should think about the person if they are under 10,3
181022,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,Respect for the classics,1
181023,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,I absolutely loved this movie I recommend for anyone to watch it,1
181024,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,This is my favorite movie I love it because there is mostly harmless sword fighting a giant R O U S s rodents of unusual size lots of humorous and quotable one liners,3
181025,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,I think this movie is very good but in the end there is some blood and violenceand there are some rodents of unusual size wich attack Wesley,1
181026,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,I love this movie and i think it is great for anyone of any age that are not to scared of giant rats,1
181027,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,As stated at the title  There are a few things I like better about the movie than the book is that you can actually hear what the priest sounds like  Dont mark this as inappropriate but he sounds like hes been kicked in the groan I dont know what else to call that,3
181028,3089번,The Princess Bride,7,I really like the princess bride  its fun and adventurous  And I also like Westly and Buttercup   its very funny to me   ALERT  caution this movie is awesome   Why I think you should only watch this movie if your 10 or over is because when I watch it I have to skip a few parts because I am not allowed to see them  But one time I saw a few parts that I can not see by accident,7
181219,3095번,The Proposal,6,I personally loved this movie  There are lots of curs words and rude words but a young child wouldnt understand that  At first i was worried it would be inapropriette but it wasnt   There is one seen when are stars collide because one is getting out of shower and one in to the shower  Biut i still all around LOVE this movie,6
181220,3095번,The Proposal,6,This hilarious romcom is perfect and funny for teens of all ages,1
181221,3095번,The Proposal,6,The problem with The Proposal is on its story and plot  Its just plain predictable  You can figure out how the movie is gonna end right in the first minutes,3
181222,3095번,The Proposal,6,Haha I like this comedy movie This is not for kids   it shows naked woman and man bumped each other on the side  There are kissing    but very funny,4
181223,3095번,The Proposal,6,i watched this and laughed soo hard and just loved the movie the only thing wz i wz watching it with my boy cuzzin who is as old as me and in the scene where they fall accidentally on each other naked was too awkward but overall a rlly good romanceCOMEDY,2
181224,3095번,The Proposal,6,The movie is greatandvery interesting  I enjoyed it however the crash though unnessacary showed no sensitive body parts so younger children probably wouldnt even understand it  Overall a brilliant movie,3
181225,3095번,The Proposal,6,WOW This movie is awesome There is a bit of nudity but nothing sensitive is shown  The woods scene with the grandmother is hilarious and it was super funny  I liked the movie any mature 12 year old would love this movie,5
181226,3095번,The Proposal,6,Not for kids,1
181227,3095번,The Proposal,6,This is a great and funny movie  It made me laugh all the way through it even at sad parts because they made it seem awkwardly funny  It had great characters and a very good story line  Might be inappropriate for some viewers though,4
182173,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,I liked this movie  Its funny and has funny stuff about pets  I liked how the main character had flaws and they all learned stuff,3
182174,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,I was expecting to watch a great movie for kids  What I actually saw was trash  This movie was so boring and the characters were really stupid and annoying,3
182175,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,The movie awesome and most kids likely elementary  up should handle it  There are a few dark messages about death and killing the rabbit character has the personality of murder but it doesnt get to intense  One scary scene most kids may be scared of is when the viper tries to bite Max  Duke Gidget has a serious crush on max but it isnt sexual A bird tries to kill Gidget but they becomes friends shortly afterward overall the movie is good,3
182176,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,The movie has good scenery and animation and teaches kids what others have been through  The story is great itself and has good characters,2
182177,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,If you have seen the trailer youve seen everything  The beginning starts of well and interesting but as it carries on you sit there feeling like you are wasting your time  So many stupid and unconvincing things occur  Very disappointed only the beginning is funny  The good bits are all in the trailer,5
182178,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,Several bad language uses    for older kids it is awesome,1
182179,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,This is the best movie ever with amazing characters and lots and lots and lots and lots of humor   This adventure would be best for kids who like animals and adventurous tales,2
182180,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,Its quite entertaining  I loved seeing this movie the first time it was released,2
182181,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,It is awesome especially if you are a pet lover I enjoyed it very much,1
182182,3137번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,I heard words like shut up and  loser  The story was just rescue something,2
183142,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,I watched this when I was 9  It was funny  ,3
183143,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,I have seen this movie and we have it but this movie is very inappropriate lots of sex language and drinking and smoking  Barts private area is shown and of course bad language  Bart is the most main offender in this movie  Violence as well Lisa punches him  The most beautiful I saw in this movie was the wedding video there was this once scene that Homer and Marge not seen have a sex reference not in their bed being naked having no clothes on  Otherwise concerning film,6
183144,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,GREAT MOVIE But is inappropriate at most times and its mostly because of violence and sex,2
183145,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,Very good better than the orignial tv show  The only really bad thing is the penis shot shown for 3 and a half secondsI tracked and the rest is fine,2
183146,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,The Simpsons Movie as funny as it is is not for some kids  There is offensive stuff but make sure your kid can ignore the bad stuff  There is fighting but no blood beside Itchy and Scratchy cartoonish  Homer as normal loves beer  There are sexual references and a scene which implies sex  But nothing is graphic  There is language D A S B  There is some gun use  In the end Homer becomes a hero after learning to be less selfish and a better father to Bart,9
183147,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,homer is a positive role model drinking in a bar       your kids will look up to him and bart when he skateboards naked,1
183148,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,I really like this movie  Its very funny and entertaining  But there are stuff to watch out for  Bart can be seen skateboarding naked Bart also drinks later in the movie there is mild use of bad language and there is evidence of violence as seen during the angry mob scene  Its good but it is more explicit than the cartoon,5
183149,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,| and ,1
183150,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,The Simpsons Movie is a pretty awsome film for comical people aged 10  above  If your child is under that age some parts are a little unsuitable with some cheeky humour  Is it suitable for kids mostly yes  But like I said not all of it is perfectly suitable,4
183151,3157번,The Simpsons Movie,8,Swears only come every once in a while in the show but overall its usually only says B but not that often  Anyway it is a suitable show for kids 9 and up,2
183512,3158번,The Simpsons,7,bad things include,1
183513,3158번,The Simpsons,7,I think this is the best show anywhere it is very funny  It may make you feel uncomfortable watching with your parents because of some of the things they say and very rarely show  Other than that I would say it is great for a 1011 year old  My parents are very strict but they allow me to watch it with my 9 year old brother  I definitely recommend this show no matter what people say,5
183514,3158번,The Simpsons,7,Older tweens and teens would be fine with the sex references and the language in The Simpsons  My 9 year old sister is fine with it so I would say around 10 and up,2
183515,3158번,The Simpsons,7,great show for all ages,1
183516,3158번,The Simpsons,7,I Personally Love This Show And The Rewatch Rate is 110 out of 100 there is lots of drinking BUT it shows you how bad things happen when you drink to much there is cussing but nothing horrible  just the d word the b word occasionally and the a word,1
183517,3158번,The Simpsons,7,This is the best family friendly show ever There is a bit of sex and stuff but if your kid is mature then most episodes will be fine,2
183518,3158번,The Simpsons,7,I guess it is entertaining but  who wants to watch yellow people be slobs,1
183519,3158번,The Simpsons,7,SO FUNNY,1
183647,3158번,The Simpsons,8,The Simpsons is a great show  As soon as my dad showed it to me I thought it was the best show ever   Its not hard to believe that there are over 30 seasons It is a little inappropriate at times but not bad enough to influence kids behavior  Come on were not dumbies,5
183648,3158번,The Simpsons,8,This isnt the best show Ive ever seen but its one of them and is definitely the funniest,1
183649,3158번,The Simpsons,8,Sometimes quite sexual  But most of the time its fine  Homer gets drunk ALOT and there is also the town drunk too  Homer also strangles Bart frequently,4
183650,3158번,The Simpsons,8,Its great for families,1
183651,3158번,The Simpsons,8,I love watching the older seasons of the Simpsons every night with my family  There are mild swear words that 1012 year olds can definitely handle  They may be some kissy kissy stuff but its never shown   The jokes can be dark or mature but most jokes are all so funny  Good for tweens and older ,6
183652,3158번,The Simpsons,8,Hello simpsons fans and others,1
183653,3158번,The Simpsons,8,This content GOOD,1
183654,3158번,The Simpsons,8,The Simpsons has been running for so long and is still going strong,1
183655,3158번,The Simpsons,8,The Simpsons is an awesome TVshow to watch it is age appropriate and it is not like Family Guy  So if your child wants to watch  it  Then that would be a good idea  As long as it doesnt curse a lot in your TV  Have fun watching this show,5
183656,3158번,The Simpsons,8,i think ages 6 513  would start  understanding you see im 8 i understand the jokes,1
184783,3178번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,I watched this movie alone  I really enjoyed it even if im 14  I think this movie is OK to watch with kids though there are some scary moments and some of them may get scared  It has great messages,4
184784,3178번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,I watched this movie when I was 7 or 8 and I do not recommend doing so  For what it was rated I think that it definitely should of been at least m pg13 great to watch with older kids,2
184785,3178번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,Sword Fights people getting hit by cars an evil ogre threatening someones family kidnapping a character gets a bloody injury on their knee which requires medical attention that they dont have but it miraculously turns out better  Otherwise good fantasy movie for 9 and 10 yearolds which positive messages,2
184786,3178번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,I loved this movie when I watched it as a kid it has some heavy fantasy themes and some creepy undertones  Some parts of the movie could be distressing for younger viewers ex  Bloody bites and scratches fighting off comical goblins with knives and tomato soup ect  But most intense things that do happen are kind of ridiculous  Things  do take a dark turn at the end though with the main character having to make peace with the death of his father by stabbing a monster that has taken on the form of his father in order to make him let his guard down  Overall I think The Spiderwick Chronicles is a great movie for older audiences or more mature kids,6
184787,3178번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,The violence is honestly not a problem  Its all just animated stuff and any kid above 10 can take it,2
184788,3178번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,I just went back and watched this movie Im 15 now but back when I first watched it age 7 it was amazing and introduced me to the Fae and Faeries  I think its very cool that there is a movie about the Fae  It even includes tons of facts about them  Now for the kids as long as your not coddling them then it should be fine,4
184789,3178번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,Look first up the rumor about the dad getting stabbed in the chest was not true but I wont deny he got stabbed in the hand  Now comes the blood there was barely any blood in it except wounds similar to the ones that kids get every week by playing outside  Of course if you plan on letting a kid younger that 9 watch then make sure hell be able to handle it there is a a little bit of fear the goblins are trying to break the circle and the twin is taken away getting pulled by the legs if you watch the full movie kids will get the idea that its never too late to make things right Jared Grace was rude to his mother but in the end apologized  That also when people seem like they are lying they are right so not to judge or jump to conclusions Jared discovered the world and no one believed him which put his family in potential danger  It also gives the trust your gut message because while the decisions he made could have involved pain and scariness and a lot of risk his gut said he was right and he was,5
184790,3178번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,pretty violent  my sister ran out of the house screaming because of the blood and screaming when they got scratched,2
184791,3178번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,There is a giant goblin and he would definitely scare little kids he is in a lot of scenes and they have a big fight and he stabs the goblin,1
185808,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,I watched this film when it first came out  And what I watched in that hour and a half was kinda disturbing  For starters in one scene they imagined ways of their parents dying  They send their parents away and every time they go somewhere on the map someone always dies  And theyre always seen kissing with disgusting exaggerated noises playing while their doing it  The neglect they have for their kids is AWFUL They actually throw one of them into a coal bin  Overall the film is shocking and appalling,8
185809,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,I thought this movie was pretty good   until it got cruel  There are cruel parents the kids try to kill them and it mentions cannibalism  Tho its good   if you arent disturbed  No judgement  I love this movie Just a but cruel there also is good stuff They stick together as siblings there are rainbows candy and magic  Tho I forgot to mention it got a bit sexual do to the scenes where the father did this thing with his neck to mother   overall great movie but think about your kids age first  Also you may laugh a dangerous amount 12  definitely tho,10
185810,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,The movie starts of on a bad note with the oldest boy Tim gets put in the hallway when he was a BABY which is so wrong  It has a very up and down middle Tim has a sister and twin brothers the kids dont really get fed unless the steal it and quite possibly the worstweirdest part of it all is the way the parents act they kiss ALL THE TIME and the dad he doesnt act like a father does this weird thing where he makes a cat noise to his wife  The best part was the last half hour,3
185811,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,This movie is good I cant really say perfect because of some downfalls but lets talk about the good stuff first The reason why I placed the age rating as age 8 or older is because my 8year old sister got to watch this with my older brother parents and of course me  Why would I be writing this review if I never watched the movie anyways OK on to the point  Good stuff the middle child Jane is a kind and amazing girl  Proof She didnt want to leave the orphan baby that was in a box near the Willoughby house alone  She wanted to find her a home  Next Tim the oldest at least I think it was Tim has some good values in him  Proof While with the nanny Linda and his siblings they walked over to the place where Jane left the orphan child  He told the nanny not to ring the doorbell otherwise she would disturb the man who lives theres work  Next the four siblings still want to give their horrible parents a second chance saying that they forgive them but they literally dont have to love them while they are still their parents but they freeze at the end  Now lets go to the bad stuff  The kids want their parents to die because they were such bad parents  They imagined them getting eaten by bears sharks and burning too and many more  The parents act so sexual with each other if I actually said it right  Tim judges the nanny because of reading her messages thinking that she has something bad to do to them since she works for their parents  I feel like thats a very bad thing because you cant always judge a person because of this and that  So he makes a thing called a nannypult or a catapult to literally THROW the nanny out of the window  While the childs parents are gone they make a mess all around the house  Do we really want our kids doing these things But behind all these downfalls there are always some good things  Im not really sure if thats all so thats all the information Im giving to the person whos reading this right now  Funny thing this actually also makes parents learn a lesson which is to take care of their children  You dont want them thinking about you as demons and monsters and all of that drama  I think you should watch the movie if I were to make a choice  If I were a parent Id explain to my children that this is just a movie and that its all drama and acting so they dont really have to copy everything a character in it does especially bad stuff  But if you are a CHILD reading this take your parents advice  Easy Thats my advice for you and sorry if I sounded a little harsh at the end  PS This movie is kinda like Matilda and if you dont know what that movie is watch it or look it up on Common Sense Media again its like Matilda but without the principal which kinda makes it more appropriate,31
185812,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,This movie was very funny and over all fantastic it was a little bit dark at some points as the children try to kill their parents but in a comedic way  The parents kiss a lot  But just funny over all,3
185813,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,I recommend this,1
185814,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,this movie was moving and dark  i would not recommend for young children this movie represents neglectful parents and misrepresents social services  the parents acted as though they would be better off without the children and refused to feed care and love the children  Sure there were some positive messages like that you should stick with our family and that there are people who will care about you   But other that that it focused on the fact that the children thought that their parents would care for them even after years of mistreatment and neglect,5
185815,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,This movie is really funny,1
185816,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,I think its good and its like I guess its like a really good movie so I really think its a movie for the whole family so yeah I hope everyone agrees with me about this movie its really good,1
185817,3251번,The Willoughbys,8,It is an amazing movie I wanna watch it again Actually Ive watched it two times  Cause it so cool  Netflix has made a great achievement  Its one of the best movies that it has made  Another person said it was a horror movie  I dont what that person is talking about But its their opinion  I aint judging,9
185818,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,It was a great movie with lots of laughs for the whole family,2
185819,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,Just no  I get that its supposed to be funny but its actually really dark and weird and sad  Its not good,3
185820,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,I am new to Netflix and I have a strange phobia of movies this is the perfect movie to fall asleep to and I find the twins the contrary of creepy The story has beautiful animation my mum is a producer and the theme of candy gives it more  Must Watch,3
185821,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,It was painful to watch  The whole time I was uncomfortable and kept thinking of how its such a bad example and influence for kids  The main characters cause many destructive car crashes think up ways of how to kill their abusive parents and injure innocent people viewing their home thats up for sale   Not to mention its extremely weird random and disjointed  My family agreed that we wished we could erase it from our minds and kept wanting to turn it off although ended up watching the whole thing  Worst movie Ive ever seen  Even worse than Cats and thats saying something ,7
185822,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,I loved this movie  I thought the plot was really good and it had lots of positive messages about family  I thought this was stopmotion but then I thought it was 3D animated  Could someone please tell me if it was animated or not There is mild themes such as being an orphan and unloving parents  Violence such as a monster popping out but mostly slapstick violence  No language whatsoever  The word is What the Willoughby,8
185823,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,Probably could go without the parents getting eaten at the end and its really weird but its a good movie to watch for a preteen,1
185824,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,I am not older than 15 but I say this movie would not apply for people under that age  In the start of the movie there is a    sound and reference to having babies    The parents are very inappropriate  and the kids set a bad example because they imagine their placenta being killed  Not for kids,4
185825,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,This movie is about some kids who try to get rid of their parents to get a normal family  I liked it because it was funny  It also had good actors,3
185826,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,Look I am older than eight and I didnt like the movie at all Maybe I shouldnt have watched it at night but it is still very sad and I couldnt sleep because of it  I stayed up until midnight because I felt my family didnt love me  Maybe you will read this and think about watching this movie  Also the first movie I hate  Thank you,6
185827,3251번,The Willoughbys,7,At the end where the bad parents are at the beach they got eaten that gave me nightmares for all my life,1
185878,3256번,The Witches,8,I personally think it depends on if you get quite scared at movies easily or not when your young if not I think its a great movie I still love it to this day if not maybe wait until your a little bit older ,1
185879,3256번,The Witches,8,This movie is really good For me It wasnt scary AT ALL just weird but my 17 yr old brother was terrified I guess it just depends on the person  Thing that disturbed me Mouse in dinner  Ok i think its just me but thats kinda gross    Thing that disturbed me Naked Luke at the end  It was blurred but you could tell what it was    I recommend but depends on the person,7
185880,3256번,The Witches,8,There is no bad language in this film although it is easy to mistake witch for something else,1
185881,3256번,The Witches,8,it is very much disturbing so please parents maybe dont let your younger child watch it when the witch takes off her mask it reveals a very disturbing looking face which used to haunt me first time I watched this movie I was about 5 my grandma put it on and I was very traumatised but now as a teen it hasnt disturbed me,1
185882,3256번,The Witches,8,I first watched this when I was 7yrs old and I needed the toilet in the middle of the movie and when I was going there and back I ran soooo fast because I was scared that one of the witches was there,1
185883,3256번,The Witches,8,My Rating PG,1
185884,3256번,The Witches,8,If you want to watch the witches then watch 2020 but still it gave me nightmares for years and also both movies are really pushing it that Witches are real just watch the 2020 trailer in the beginning it says Withes are real and they are among us,1
185885,3256번,The Witches,8,This film is actually scary no joke,1
185886,3256번,The Witches,8,This movie is definitely for those families who want to watch scary movies but nothing intense you know  I totally recommend this movie for everyone,3
185887,3256번,The Witches,8,Honestly this movie wasnt that scary to me  It was really just disturbing  Theres nudity  What kind of kids thriller shows a naked little boy Not an appropriate one  This movie would be very frightening to maybe a 12yr old  Not me  But is very disturbing  When the head witch and all the other witches go to their true form its gross  Good movie but not for kids,10
186297,3290번,Thor,8,I love this movie It is a great one of the first MCU movies you should show your kids,1
186298,3290번,Thor,8,Why is this only 12 plus I think that the main form of violence was just in a bit of martial arts and Thors hammer creating storms  There was a point where a robot shot heat at them and flipped over a bunch of cars  There was no swearing that I can recall there was one kiss that was about it  Great special effects a few comedy moments and an amazing plot  I loved this movie and I think you will to,6
186299,3290번,Thor,8,It is funny and has some fighting but it is still not scary,1
186300,3290번,Thor,8,Thor is an interesting idea  To spin Norse mythology into a superhero film is a challenging risk but it paid off  The change of an impulsive and ignorant son to a loving and strong leader is astonishing  Nothing really bad but some action violence non gory and one character gets drunk  Who doesnt love Loki Seriously  Go watch Thor and the rest of the MCU,7
186301,3290번,Thor,8,has actionviolence throughout,1
186302,3290번,Thor,8,Thor is kinda thicc but could be thiccer  Thor and Spooderman have a cool battle and almost kill each other  Sexy squidward tries to kiss Thor but does not get to  This is a ok movie that could be a little thiccer,4
186303,3290번,Thor,8,marvel has made another great  action pact movie but its about gods  All in all this is a great action movie with very little fighting and some kissing  For violence  there are fight scenes  Frost giants throw ice spikes and attempt to stab people with ice  when touched by a ice giant some of there skin turn purple  Someone does get stabbed  The frost giant leader almost kills oden  but loki blasts him away with a beam  Loki attempts to kill thor with a metal suit that shoots energy beams there are exploding cars but no gets killed  At one point there is blood on thors face  In the beginning thor gets tazed by a girl  thor beats of a bunch of S H I E L D agents there is no blood  There is one big kiss at the end and thor is shown shirtless not sexually  All in all this is a great movie that your 11 year old needs to see at some point in hisher life,13
186304,3290번,Thor,8,ok movie but good for younger kids who cant watch other marvel movies yet,1
186305,3290번,Thor,8,Great movie but extremely violent and kind of scary  I saw it because I always watch things above my age,2
186713,3318번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,This movie isnt as good as Japanese Futa,1
186714,3318번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,This film first caught my eye when I was watching the preview of the movie on the 2012 Diamond Edition DVD of Cinderella 1950 at my friends cabin  I saw this magical film for the first time in 2020 and loved it This fourth installment is about Tinker Bell meeting her fraternal twin sister Periwinkle even though they cant meet each other because the Winter Woods is too cold for warm fairies and the warmer seasons of Pixie Hollow are too hot for winter fairies  Preschoolers could be in suspense when Queen Clarion says that if the freeze spreads around Pixie Hollow Life there would change forever and no fairy would ever fly again  Anyway I love this movie Its basically Frozen with fairies instead of humans released a year earlier Secret Of The Wings was released in 2012 and Frozen was released in 2013 This film is one of the best ones Ive seen of all time theres no scary moments at all so little kids wont complain,6
186715,3318번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,This movie is appropiate for all ages,1
186716,3318번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,You grow out by three years old Ive seen that in younger kids,1
186717,3318번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,It is a very good movie about sisters  Any kid can watch it  No scary parts AT ALL and I am very sensitive It got kind of boring after watching it seven times though  I am more into watching Planes and PlanesFire and Rescue,5
186718,3318번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,This installment in the benign Tinker Bell movie series shows off some serious Disneystar talent as the McClain sisters sing a new song  The reason for the 6 and up rating is only because the storyline is much more indepth than the others so a better attention span is needed to fully grasp this movie,2
186719,3318번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,This movie is better for younger kids   It wasnt very interesting for a 10 year old  The Winterland is very pretty  It teaches one not to give up and to have persistence  It also show that somebody can make a mistake and fix it,5
186720,3318번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,Hi I am M9PIXARs friend,1
186721,3318번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,I am 7 years old and when I saw this movie I really liked it because it shows that family should be together and that sometimes you half to follow your dreams,1
187430,3354번,Toy Story 3,6,The funniest jokes out of all three Toy Story movies Greatest quality animation out of all threebest scripts out of all threeect PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT,4
187431,3354번,Toy Story 3,6,Even though this is my least favorite in the Toy Story franchise this one is still 5star worthy  It is hilarious  The reason I rated this on for 2 or older is because anyone of any age should watch this  If your child cant handle the scary scenes just cover their eyes so they can enjoy the rest of the movie  Overall great movie,5
187432,3354번,Toy Story 3,6,This was an absolutely amazing movie with lots of connections to the real world and very inspiring  However its also pretty scary and sad and some younger viewers might find it hard to understand hidden meanings beneath the character developments  All in all great movie but not for everyone,3
187433,3354번,Toy Story 3,6,Some moments of gambling one very scary scene where a baby twists its head around graphically The most scariest toy story yet Should be a PG,3
187434,3354번,Toy Story 3,6,Third Toy Story is the best but the most intense,1
187435,3354번,Toy Story 3,6,For ages 5 and up,1
187436,3354번,Toy Story 3,6,It touched my heart  Best toy story movie ever made I feel any age is the right age for this  There is comedy thats age appropriate and even my dad loved the film  I even have the it on DVD  The only thing you may consider inappropriate is romance between Buzz light year and Jessie and ken in one scene is in nothing but his underwear,6
187437,3354번,Toy Story 3,6,This movie rocks There are a lot of funny moments and colorful animation If you want to see some of the best stuff in movie history than this is the movie for you,3
187438,3354번,Toy Story 3,6,This is a really good movie  It is also a good family movie  I love toy story  Ther isnt anything bad in it that kids shouldnt see,4
187704,3355번,Toy Story 4,8,Its about demons taking over toys  Its anti jesus,2
187705,3355번,Toy Story 4,8,its a good movie but   THEY BETTER MAKE TOY STORY 5 WHERE WOODY AND BO PEEP GO LIVE WITH BONNIE AND DUKE CA BOOM GETS TO BE WITH HIS OWNER AND DUCKY AND BUNNY GET TO CONKER THE WORLD,2
187706,3355번,Toy Story 4,8,this is a good movie though the only bad thing about is that creepy ventriloqist dummy he creeps me out,1
187707,3355번,Toy Story 4,8,Some people are saying that the dummies are creepy but I love old time creepy stuff please dont judge me  The movie is good but might scare some people  Read the other reviews,3
187708,3355번,Toy Story 4,8,Its okay but I like how number 3 ends  It also is scary  Who would put slappy in a small kids movie,4
187709,3355번,Toy Story 4,8,The movie ended with the toys separating which is unacceptable   I have watched all the movies as a kid to now and that just should not have happened  Im an beyond irrated that this decision was made  If there is ever a toy story 5 it better be all the toys meeting up AND STAYING TOGETHER  Thank you,5
187710,3355번,Toy Story 4,8,The movie is heartwarming and I love it  Forky is consistent saying he is trash and wants to go to a garbage dump which could be portrayed as suicidal  Forky ends up staying and is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO funny Bo Peep is strong and the movie is funny Gabby Gabby ends up being really really sweet the dummies arent THAT scary  I apoligize for the review I first wrote This movie is INCREDIBLE,4

187712,3355번,Toy Story 4,8,,1
188034,3372번,TrollsTopia,8,This series ended on August 11 of this year and its great Ive been liking the Trolls franchise since I was 9 years old This series takes place after Trolls World Tour with multiple new trolls from every tribe to be honest TrollsTopia was kinda a terrible idea because the pop trolls own their own land the other trolls should move back to their old homes the other trolls dont have the color schemes to be in Troll Village Except Cooper who is a funk troll At first I hated this series but now I love it I really like Poppy and Branch but my favorite characters from the new series are Holly Darlin and Minuet because they are so stubborn at times but funny Fans of the Trolls franchise will love this show,4
188035,3372번,TrollsTopia,8,The animation style is slightly different from The Beat Goes On not in a bad way   Its an adorable show  with a great story line considering the fact that we never got to see Trolstopia entirely in Trolls World Tour   Sure some of the jokes are childish but thats ok  If you are apart of the Trolls fandom you will love it   It does include Broppy  Moments Branch x Poppy    I love how its all about adjusting to their new way of life   It has a great message behind it   I recommend,8
188036,3372번,TrollsTopia,8,This shouldnt be Grated  Should be TVY  The series is childish like the movie  Also singing,4
188109,3373번,Trolls,8,This movie was fine a little bit of pretty OK humor but what really gets me is the MARKETING Its gone a little a LOT overboard,2
188110,3373번,Trolls,8,Too much sugarcoated scenes but violence lined within the scenes  Good for little kids But boring for older ones,2
188111,3373번,Trolls,8,Personally I think that this movie was a hit  Point dreamworks The main character Poppy is a strong passionate motivated character Now Ive read a lot of other comments about how Bridget and King Gristle make quote on quote Sexual Comments towards each other  But the thing is that dreamworks knew that  there would be multiple parents that would be dragged into the theaters as the price of their young childs happiness So of course they are going to add something  like that into the movie I mean yes there are jokes like that in this movie but they are so stupid that they just fly over little kids head And as for the poses Bridget makes being sexual  I just want to make the point clear that they were trying to make the characters do funny things because its not like youre 5 year old is going to walk up to you the day after and ask Mommy why was that character making sexual poses towards the other,5
188112,3373번,Trolls,8,I think this movie is one of the most kid friendly things Ive ever seen and I mean this in a bad way because some things kind of have to be inappropriate but not to much in order to make kids laugh  And these songs just keep going and I hate them so much  The end of the movie is just so stupid  All the trolls do at the end is make the Bergens happy instead of putting them under arrest for almost eating all of the annoying trolls  I know that a lot of people like this movie but I hate it and I do not recommend it,5
188113,3373번,Trolls,8,I think that some parents should explain to their child what is real and what is not real before going to see a kids movie So i really think that the parents should stop complaining about their child being so scared,1
188114,3373번,Trolls,8,I was surprised to see that someone had rated it 18  I mean the trolls world is colorful and the scenes are very creative  I think it would appeal to a little kid  Yes the bergen  eating trolls stuff can be a bit scary to a younger kid but its not really that scary  My friends little sister watched it and loved it  I wouldnt show it too the sensitive child though  There are fun lighthearted songs and catchy tunes  It also gives great messages  Like why you should stay on the bright side  And that you shouldnt pretend to be someone else Just to get somebodys attention like Bridget did   The only thing I didnt really like about this movie was how rude branch was to Poppy  After she finished singing he threw her guitar into a fire  But in the very ending they become pals  Branch also said mean things to poppy but I think kids would know not too repeat what he said  Other than that the movie is a fast paced fun loving musical  thats colorful and cute,15
188115,3373번,Trolls,8,This movie has great songs funny moments that would make kid teen or adult laugh   I dont get the too much violents thing everyone is talking about but its wrong  the movie it funny and makes you want to get up and dance to the song,2
188116,3373번,Trolls,8,this is a good family movie ,1
188117,3373번,Trolls,8,TROLLS is a energetic and exuberant adventure,1
188118,3373번,Trolls,8,its bad i mean why so bland i cant believe how bland the story is so is another bad dream works movie so you know what to expect,1
188466,3388번,Turning Red,8,Not the best Pixar but as an avid pixar fan I watched it with my family and I just felt really awkward with all the talk on girls puberty and boy band crushes I thought it was too girly to enjoy I dont recommend it  The story was terrible the animation was fine but it felt like an overlong puberty video,2
188467,3388번,Turning Red,8,This movie encapsulates everything wrong with current culture  Its overly feminist a tad bit racist and relies on overused cliches to be funny   The characters are horrible the main character is a little st the entire film and is constantly whining about how perfect she is  Then as per these newer films that only kinda sorta have an antagonist weve got her borderline abusive mother  Shes a total control freak no wonder her kid is horrid  Were supposed to feel bad for the mom when her mother Mei Meis grandma shows up with the rest of the aunts and we can see the child inside of her  Please  Then weve got her father  Who does absolutely nothing zip nil goose egg  He is shoved aside by his wife in what can only be described as a onesided marriage  The funny parts fall flat the emotional parts dont exist  Its supposed to be a commentary on the life of teens growing up but I see absolutely no parrels to my own experience as a fifteenyearold  This is a complete st show of a movie that doesnt deserve any of the popularity that its recieved,13
188468,3388번,Turning Red,8,not a movie for little kids,1
188469,3388번,Turning Red,8,Ive watched this movie about 4 or 5 times I personally like it but I know its definitely not everyones cup of tea it starts to talk about periods in the start of the movie and I think its fine but if you arent ready to go into conversation about periods with your children I wouldnt recommend it  Also towards the beginning Mei develops a crush on the Daisymart clerk and draws sexy drawings of him  Once again if you dont want to explain what that means to your kiddos I dont recommend watching this with them  Overall its a pretty good movie and I liked the characters,4
188470,3388번,Turning Red,8,Turning Red is okay,1
188471,3388번,Turning Red,8,I think it would be better but I realized that there are many  seens that are for the older kids,1
188472,3388번,Turning Red,8,I found it really funny intriguing and showed lots of metaphors for what is deemed acceptable for a woman  It was emotional and high quality Amazing,3

189447,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,The movie added shadow magic that is so creepy  Norys best friend uses shadow magic to cheat on a  test  They unnecessarily had romance between Nory and Andres  Pepper was super mean and snooty  If you are sensitive to evil characters you might not like this movie,5
189448,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,I havent read the books but Im pretty sure that based on some of the reviews they were better  This movie seems so much like Harry Potter  The magic school and the different groups in Harry Potter they are called different Houses and in Upside Down Magic they are pretty much the same exact thing  Dont bother with this movie  I gave it two stars because I liked the singing teacher,5
189449,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,This movie was a waste of my time  Good gracious Ill never get that 5760 seconds back into my life  I was never down for watching this but ended up watching to see if it got any betterto be frank it didnt  Best part of this movie is that there are no laugh tracks if there was I may have just passed out  Tons of horrible humor and cringe  At one point she said Thats cool as heck I will never recover from that,7
189450,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,the movie is great because a girl is very confedeint  The headmaster isnt very nice tho  It was scary for a little but if it didnt have that it would be sappy,3
189451,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,I have never read the book but I realize everyone comments mentions how its nothing similar  Nory in the movie is just trying everything to fit in and the whole movie is about that making it dumb  All the the other characters seem to be just thrown in there  Norys best friend the hoy Black magic Its all just thrown in there and has no point in the movie whatsoever  And that girl that introduced that magic stuff to both best friend was stupid  Like what does she have to do with it  So please do not waste ur time watching it,10
189452,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,I think its the best,1
189453,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,This movie is a straight ripoff of avatar the last air bender or the legend of Korra this really offended as avatar is one of the best shows to ever exist Rios off the fireearthairand water thing just makes me mad,1
189454,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,The first part was great It was pretty different from the book though    But it was still fun to see all the magic and characters  The teachers are kind of mean but overall it was great Until Reina got possessed by shadow magic and became a freaky looking shadow monster I went into another room when this happened  I was in the other room plugging my ears when I heard my sister crying  All of a sudden my mom yelled Get in here and turn the TV off right now When I came in to turn the TV off I saw a huge dementor looking thing terrorizing kids on the screen  I am 10 and it scared me to tears  Not the Disney movie I want to see and not the Disney I knew,11
189455,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,The move isnt at all like the books  In the books Reina isnt a character flickers turn stuff invisible Pepper in an upsidedown fuzzie Elliot is friends with Nory and also freezes things instead of making smoke Sage students dont live at Sage they live in their own house in the town of Dunwinddle for example Nory moved to her aunts house so she could go to Sage Academy Sage isnt some closedoff school in the middle of a forest its in the town of Dunwinddle Pepper is nicer shes also shy in the books shadow magic doent exist they added a introsoundtrack to the movie and thats all the things the move changed and made worse  I wouldt bother watching the movie  Oh and in the videos on Disney Channels Youtube channel they NEVER ONCE credit  the makers of the books,4
189456,3422번,Upside-Down Magic,8,I love the movie  so do my friends  I recognized all the actors and the movie is a little bit scary at the end but thats 1 reason why its fun  whatch on disney now youtube tv ect,4
190081,3437번,Victorious,7,TVGRated in USA 12 in UK  For violence and rude humor at least  This is not a good show for children  It has many pretend swear words like Holy chiz and No chiz parody of sht and sometimes they say FUDGE I Started watching this when I was 11 and it was too much comic violence Cat slaps Beck in the face really hard in front of the whole class and it taught me that No sht cause it was so obvious what it all means  13,8
190082,3437번,Victorious,7,Their is no sex at all but their is a lot of kissing lots their is a bit of language,1
190083,3437번,Victorious,7,This is one of Nicks shows that I like Im not a fan of iCarly  Violence in one episode a character pretends to be a stunt double and someone asks to clean up some blood  A person threatens to cut off another persons head  Nothing toto violent  Language most of the time they say oh my god  Sex they use words like boobs  Sometimes characters kiss in the halls and theres also couples,7
190084,3437번,Victorious,7,This show is one of my favorites because not only is it funny with many main characters but it also has lots of catchy songs sung by the actors  It truly is hilarious and really entertains you,2
190085,3437번,Victorious,7,Victorious is totally not for kids I think I found out that I started watching it when my friend told me that it was alright    Later I thought it was pretty bad  The kissing definitely is not okay for kids    I would not do that when I am a teenager   Jade looks like a goth on the show and she dating Beck is something I do not want to see    They do too many things that are not good for kids    Trina has problems thinking she is better than everyone else    The clothes they wear are some of the worst I have seen in my life    The only people I think are okay are Tori and Andre     The language is inappropriate  and shouldnt be talking back to parents and teachers  I cant stand Robbie   I think Disney channel has a lot better shows,12
190086,3437번,Victorious,7,its a great show but I think its not little kids but mostly for teen and tweens just sayin  I love teennick  but  I think that victorious is not a show for 6 and 7 year olds,1
190087,3437번,Victorious,7,Victorious is mainly a spinoff of one of the best shows of all time iCarly  But thats alright  After having a side spotlight in Zoey 101 it was popular when I was like 5 so I never really watched it and the role of Shelby Marx in iCarly the year before Victorious started Justice has really come far with this show  At times her character Tori along with her sister Trina Daniella Monet are pretty exaggerated  For example in the episode Crazy Ponnie where the awesome Jennette McCurdy guest stars Trina is very sick  She sneezes constantly and remarks OMG look what came out of my nose It can be gross and weird at times  I find Tori to be a good role model for kids standing up for herself and believing in her dreams not to sound clique  Jade Elizabeth Gillies is a rude person much like Sam from guesswhatshow who is dating Beck Avan Jogia throughout much of the series  The sex symbol below my review is just indicating the times they kiss in the show  Overall I think this was a pretty cool sitcom but I wasnt crushed to see it go  If you liked this show however I suggest you check out Sam  Cat if you havent already which stars Cat Ariana Grande from this show and Sam from iCarly,13
190088,3437번,Victorious,7,This is none other than one of the greatest shows Ive ever seen  Parents and kids will love it though it is aimed for tweens and teens mostly  It circles around a group of close friends in the school called Hollywood Arts which is a middle school and high school for artistic kids with special talents singing acting puppeteering or just being really smart etc  Their main teacher who teaches acting Mr  Sikowitz pronounced psycho wits is unlike most teachers a large sense of humor a little on the odd side but is friendly and has an addiction to coconuts,4
190089,3437번,Victorious,7,OMG this is crazy this is not a bad show at all oh and btw they where not in a locked room they where in a RV they where not wearing bras they where wearing bikini tops anyone with eyes can see that but you guys wear probably where not paying attention and even if your kids thought they where wearing bras im pretty sure every girl wears a bra at some point in there life I know so crazy gasp and if you think they dress crazy never ever take your child outside,1
190090,3437번,Victorious,7,i laughed so much when i saw it the characters are very good its for kids no violence and no violence but in one episode tori hit jade but it wasnt for real so its for kids,1
190121,3437번,Victorious,8,This show is a great show  Tori is a great role model and if anyone has a problem with this show get off this site u haters if you take this show off the air then I will never watch nick again and those are NORMAL OUTFITS is u have a problem suck it up and go complain to ur kids not the producers you r ruining it for everyone else,2
190122,3437번,Victorious,8,This show sucks it does not even bother to be that enjoyable it does not even show what high school is like all it is is a school for acting and singing WHY   JUST WHY these characters are not getting an education of real subjects that is just sad,2
190123,3437번,Victorious,8,Parents They were wearing bikini tops in Survival of the Hottest and Cat is not a whore  You people are over exaggerating  Do you think Dan would ever put sexual stuff on a KIDS SHOW The show is completely clean  Tori never took her shirt off and lent Cat her bra  She squeezed the toilet water out of it and gave it back to her  Jade and Beck never said anything about having sex  Andre never said You look hot without a bra or whatever  Your kids are gonna learn about stuff like that one way or the other  Its not like they are gonna go Oh I think Im gonna be like Jade then go off and do mean things to people or go like Oh I think Im gonna go be like Beck then go rent an RV and live in it so heshe doesnt live under their parents rules  Its not Cats fault she didnt know her friends were stuck in an RV  She went to the bathroom and went to go ask what that song was  She wasnt doing stuff in her bra it was a stinking BIKINI TOP Sure they use crap chiz or fudge as a substitute for a certian bad f word but if you tell your kids not to use that language they wont  They might not even feel like it  Never once has this show been racist  Its completely fine for kids,18
190124,3437번,Victorious,8,In my view the bit s where your suppost to laugh are just annoying Its UNfunny and pointless There is a very rare case where I giggle Its a shambles and its unrealstic,1
190125,3437번,Victorious,8,Lighten up a bit guysAll of you guys who are giving this bad reviews are really WAY too overprotective about your children  The worst it actually gets is boobs Seriously  What I find funny is the minute you parents get a show which does not make us tweens feel like 6yearolds you go out and bag it out to the point of making things up about the show to make it look bad  So dont listen to those weird reviews with really bad grammar Victorious is fine for eight and up ,4
190126,3437번,Victorious,8,FUN DRAMA FASHION ART TEENS all this exist on nickeldoeon victorious,1
190127,3437번,Victorious,8,A bunch of self absorved insensitive girls walking around in short shorts and screaming at each other belongs on MTV not a kid network,1
190128,3437번,Victorious,8,I watch victoriousAnd it is very funny like some of Cats lines but can have some bad stranger danger things  In survival of the hottest Cat starts partying with some random boys when she says she is goring to the restroom  There is also Trina Toris sister that is always wearing racy clothes,3

191130,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,the movie was a  2 hour garbage about some girl trying to save heros and is a bad movieSo in the first few frames of this movie you  see a marvel ripoff where a guy gets 2 swords flying toward him like thor and heros look like iron man and  mt lady from my hero academia Theres even a character named all power who is a ripoff of all might from my hero academia   In the next frames you see a girl being bullied  by a 5 year old becuase she doesnt have powers though she wants to be a superhero  which is an obvuis ripoff to my hero academia then they go  in a ugly base which has the students of ua high school just tweeked by there gender  a girl named guppy has a power of fire and ice and obvuis ripoff of shoto todoroki  and then theres a guy with a power to  get whichever power he wants which would be a ripoff of yayororuz and bakugo from my hero academia another girl who can sing is a ripoff of two charactersuraraka and jiro  a kid who bends his neck is a ripoff of a guy named sero Another kid who is slo mo but is seen digestig an exxesive amount of food is a ripoff of a guy named rikido the start of the movie is basically avengers and a 2hour waste movie  The movie and the ending made no sense and the spaceships were balls of foams with strings on  as if not frustrating enough the ending is just a kid discovering  the aliens were nice and THE END THE WORST MOVIE IN THE PLANET netflix gave robert rodriquez 2 hours to make a movie and 100 dollars I want to point out robert rodriquez is a good filmmaker its just this movie that should be erased from existence,9
191131,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Pretty disappointing   if you havent see the for I guess you can sit down and enjoy it,1
191132,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Its okay I mean I hated it but my little sister seemed to love it I think its really predictable but my sis loves it basically Im saying if your older you wont like it as much as your children,1
191133,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,It sucked  No point   At first when I started watching with my brother it seemed like a normal movie  But then when she was taken from her school to the heroics lab    The CGI sucked  Personally I dont watch movies where kids get tortured where at the end they find out they were only being tested  DONT WASTE 2 HOURS WATCHING,7
191134,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,watch with family members this would be the best movie for movie night ,2
191135,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,I LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED IT It has many good voices and infuces,1
191136,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Cool movie with positive messages all the way through  Its actionpacked and never bores you  It has a good plot and no big disappointments  Violence is very small and wouldnt scare most kids  Though the acting was lacking at times like when the girl starts singing its almost laughable just so ridiculous  Also there is some consumerism as some characters always use iPads apple stuff,6
191137,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Dont watch horrible worse then my sisters nursery rhymes CGI horrible acting sucks and it was so boring I didnt watch the full movie I watched a YouTube review and the plot is horrible this is not some kid version of the avengers it mickey mouse and his friends as superheros and horrible powers dont watch the jokes are so cringey and cheesy,1
191138,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Fine to watch on a family night wont scare kids,1
191139,3465번,We Can Be Heroes,6,I really liked it  and it was amazing,1
191935,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,This movies great  I feel like this movie is more accurate with the book than the new one  Its a very cute movie with some very interesting scenes  It can be kind of scary times for younger kids but overall its a sweet family movie  Definitely consider this for Friday night,5
191936,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,This movie is better than its successor Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  It shows good messages because they sing songs about what you should and should not do  My little brother likes to watch this movie and he was not frightened by the scary images  I used to watch this movie with my cousins every time they came over for Christmas,4
191937,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,This is a great movie overall  I love the book and the movie but one thing for parents  It only contains one scary scene but other than that great movie,3
191938,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,its not bad my 4 year old sister saw this and she was calm she did not say she was scared and besides its telling us kids to be honest not lie,1
191939,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,1971 Willy Wonka was great I prefer the 1971 version over the 2005 one  Any parentkid that says 1971 WONKA HAS BAD BAD BOTE SCENE11 1 STERS EITENPLUS are just too much of a fing py  I love to reenact the boat scene sometimes,5
191940,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,I was shocked to see this movie was G  G ratings are for pure family movies  This was not pure  Kids are almost killed their is a disturbing scene where the group rides a boat down a tunnel with scary imagery flashing on the walls Willy Wonka is just creepy and more  It was also weird  I liked the Tim Burton version but this was just bad,5
191941,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,I loved this movie so much it is my childhood  This is darker though than I remember I mean the boat ride a kids film A girl almost explodes and a girl falls into a furnace  There probably is nothing your kids wont understand like I did but Willy Wonka knew what he was doing where was Agusuts Gloops seat in the boat  I think 7 and up can watch,5
191942,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,Good movie I watched this when I was seven and did not have any nightmares the night after it  However a couple of scary parts such as loud music and dark scenes but aside from that no violence and fun movie to watch as a family and do not worry it will not give your children nightmares from the scary parts,2
191943,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,Willy Wonka is a family classic its colorful creative whimsical and funny  The songs are amazing the plot is entertaining the characters are full of variety the backgrounds are a pleasure to behold it is just an incredible movie Even Charlie Bucket is a positive role model  It has good message about caring  An only bad role is Veruca Salt because she is a rich girl who wants everything and being spoiled but nothing an issue  These kids doing stuff who was going into a bad game show  Gene Wilders Willy Wonka is way better than Johnny Depps because hes more like a stranger than Genes  Well I like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as well  Yes it is based on Roald Dahls classic book  When I was a fifth grader my teacher let do Violet Beauregard assignment and amp me and my classmates can plot it  Yes she becomes blue and fat  I really wish there was a school play and I watched several videos  The only iffy things about the movie are The implications of Grampa Joe doing tobacco Wonkas dark humor especially regarding what will happen to the children after they break the rules Charlie and Grandpa Joe drinks soap And of course the deranged boat ride  We all remember that and what was going on but for those who do not well Wonka takes everyone on a boat ride a calm quiet Wonkastyle boat ride   which soon enters a dark tunnel which shows images of a worm entering a guys mouth a chicken getting its head chopped off something gross involving a bug or lizard and I dont think I wanna find out what it is and also Wonka starts singing and he sounds progressively more psychotic as the song goes on and by the end he is screaming the lyrics as most of the guests on the boat are terrified  Ok well that went insane very quickly  Though never scared me but these characters especially casts get scared  Nothing sexy stuff but when you look for inflammation like Violet then you may find it inappropriate by Deviantart users because they looked thicc and very fat  I really liked to see the candy garden and there is filled with candy  But aside from those aspects overall a wonderful family film I recommended for ages 7,20
191944,3523번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,Its really nice but there are some scary scenes,1
193468,3591번,Zombies 2,8,This movie is the best Awesome songs and a great plot YOU REALLY SHOULD WATCH,3
193469,3591번,Zombies 2,8,This movie is a masterpiece The actors are absolutely brilliant  Meg donnelly has definitely improved her acting to be one of the best on the film too Milo manheim was as good as ever  All the actors from zombies 1 were as amazing as ever  The new actors were absolutely fantastic Chandler kinney as willa had the seriousness and sarcasm  Pearce Joza as wyatt had the seriousness and the comedy  Ariel Martin Aka Baby Ariel had the comedy and the adorableness The plot was amazing  I dont know why people are saying it was rushed and they didnt know what was going on  I understood all of it  They were probably just on their phones not paying attention  The characters even had character development from the first film The songs are much better too I have had them in my haed ever since it came out The dances are amazing too  There is one kiss ate the end between zed and addison but you cant really see it  zed kinda covered addisons face with his heads so it wasnt explicit or any thing  There was no sexualised dancing or movements like there was in descendants 3  It was still a bit cheesy but its from Disney channel what do you expect The breaking of the fourth wall was a bit weird but if you look past that it is amazing It might be a bit scary for 4 and below ages when the werewolves wolf out their eyes light up and they bare their fangs and claws but it depends on the child  There are no bad role models either so if your child looks up the actors in interviews and YouTube in general they will see amazing young people that are kind funny and good people  Overall film is epic and I definitely recommend it to you,24
193470,3591번,Zombies 2,8,I love this movie I liked this first movie a lot but I think this is even better  The songs are really catchy and I like them  There is some mildly freighting scenes but I really like the plot You will want to watch the first one first or else it wont make much sense  The effort put in to the speech songs and scenery are amazing  A mustwatch for me,7
193471,3591번,Zombies 2,8,Zombies 2 is a pretty lukewarm movie  Its not awful but the acting is just not my favorite and the plot is kind of all over the place  Also theres so many things about this movie that dont make sense like if the mayor reinstated all monster segregation laws then why were the zombies and werewolves still at school,3
193472,3591번,Zombies 2,8,It has quality acting and I loved it  It has a few songs that are really catchy and it has a clever layout and ideas  I LOVED when Addison thinks shes a werewolf but she isnt and in the end her hair glows in her sleep so it implies that she really is a werewolf and in the background its a full moon  I think that the necklace only worked in the moonlight  Very good film and even some parents will enjoy it  All kids should see it but I think mostly 9 year olds like it more,6
193473,3591번,Zombies 2,8,this is my favorite one so far i know there is only 2 i think its cool how Addison is so accepting of all creatures a definite stuck at home watch need,1
193474,3591번,Zombies 2,8,These people needs to learn the definition of zombies  They are dead eating humans that eat other humans not nice zombies  Also there isnt a bracelet to control zombies  Thats so dumb,4
193475,3591번,Zombies 2,8,Zombies 2  the film is amazing  I loved the dancing and the songs they were really good and I cant decide which song is my favourite Flesh and Bone We own the night or The call to the  wild I especially love the wolves and also Addisonwho wants to find where she  belongs its a mystery,3
193476,3591번,Zombies 2,8,I think it is a great movies for kids  Some parts may be a little scary for younger kids,2
193477,3591번,Zombies 2,8,it is better than zombies but i hate that addison just goes with the wolves when shes not one also zed steals addisons necklace bucky is offensive he treats zombies horibly and everyone is scared of werewolves,1
193766,3595번,Zootopia,7,Zootopia is a a awesome disney movie for families it has just about everything you would want in a animated movie mystery action great charecters and it has a great plot  I would really recommend watching this movie,1
193767,3595번,Zootopia,7,Wonderful film Judys personality is a WONDERFUL role model  Interesting and humorous Judys right try your best,4
193768,3595번,Zootopia,7,This moving story tells you about how we should be open to all races and I totally agree  Amazing,2
193769,3595번,Zootopia,7,A classic underdog story Judy a bunny in a world full of animals wants to become a police officer but she instead is a meter maid  After she is told to resign she instead takes on a missing persons case and after solving it she is seen as a hero  There are some sex jokes and there are even a  few references to Breaking Bad but no one under 12 would even notice them,3
193770,3595번,Zootopia,7,From the creators of Frozen and Big Hero 6 comes an allnew original story that brings us laughs love and adventure in this new original film  Judy Hopps is a young bunny with the dream of becoming a police officer despite constant reminders that a bunny cop is a crazy idea  Her wish is granted when she is dubbed the very first rabbit police officer and heads off to Zootopia a multimammal paradise where predator and prey seemingly live in peace and harmony  With the weight of a new case on her shoulders Judy must race against time to solve the mystery and prove that she is more than your average dumb bunny  However in the midst of a shifty fox named Nick her job is about to get a whole lot harder  Disney has brought us a remarkable production that defies stereotypes embraces friendship and shows us the true outcome of perseverance  And after all whats not to like The animation is beautiful the voice cast is spot on and the script is brilliant  Judy Hopps is far from your average dumb bunny  Shes clever witty determined and encouraging  Nick Wilde starts out as a shifty scam artist fox but with the help of Judy he learns the error of his ways and looks past his own stereotypes while assisting her  While this movie has numerous positive messages and role models it has a fair amount of peril and language  SPOILER ALERTS Predators go savage and chase Judy and Nick  There is a jumpscare when a tiger jumps from out of the darkness in its cage  Early in the movie 9yearold Judy is pushed and clawed across the face by a bully fox and later in the movie Nick has a flashback to when he was bullied by other animals  Theres an explosion a train crash and falling from heights  Mr  Big threatens to ice Nick and Judy or drown them in icy water but he changes his mind at the last minute  In one scene it appears that Nick has turned savage and he bites Judy  Aside from all of the violence there is frequent namecalling with insults such as jerk stupid dumb loser and at least three uses of oh my God  At one point it seems as though someone has said hell but they really didnt  The only sex is an animal naturalist club where mammals meet together without clothes its extremely awkward for Judy but audience members probably wont be rattled  Amidst all of this theres a good amount of humor in the movie  Some references such as the DMV or The Godfather probably wont be as obvious to the kids but theres still plenty of laughs in there for young viewers too  There are also great messages about teamwork friendship perseverance antibullying following your dreams and looking beyond stereotypes  All in all this is probably one of 2016s greatest films quite honestly being the 24highestgrossing film of all time and it is definitely worth seeing,25
193771,3595번,Zootopia,7,Good to watch once,1
193772,3595번,Zootopia,7,At first before I saw this I thought it would be a lame animated kiddie movie but in the end it was pretty cute  It has great messages for kids like not to give up  The trailer might turn you off from seeing the movie because it doesnt really show what the movie is about but any little kids will probably enjoy  There is one or two dark scenes where animals are locked in cages that kids who get scared easily might not like  This is a great movie to watch as a family with younger kids,5
193773,3595번,Zootopia,7,Im ticked at these parent reviews  Our 10 yearold couldnt sleep at night  What Your child was scared at a playful acting scene between two characters acting to fight I dont know what kids these days fantasize about but Jesus only knows  This movie is phenomenal best animated movie in history   It shows you that the blacks shouldnt be against whites or vice versa  Were all in this together as America  If youre gonna get aggressive to be aggressive the cops are coming  This is a great movie with all the anticop BLM bullcrap going on  Great message adorable characters,11
193774,3595번,Zootopia,7,Honestly this movie is very good  I thought it was MUCH better than The Secret Life of Pets  Well at least older kids my age might think so  Take your kids to see Secret Life of Pets because for a kid movie this movie is pretty mature  I am nine years old and thought this movie was VERY scary  The animals go savage and act like theyre drunk  Theres a scary black jaguar part when he goes crazy and a animal almost purposely drowns the main characters in cold water BUTTTTT on the good side this movie has really good messages and awesome likeable role models  So before letting your preschoolers see this movie think about my reveiw  But if your a parent of  a preschooler than I recommend you watch this,10
193862,3595번,Zootopia,8,Zootopia was a very good movie  It was funny beautiful and heartwarming  But dont be fooled Adults can enjoy this movie just as much as kids can  Theres even a notsosubtle Breaking Bad reference  This movie deals with subjects such as bullying and racism A big part of the plot revolves around making predators look bad and making people treat them differently  Some animals go savage and there is some jumpscare scenes with these savage animals  Overall this movie promotes friendship and equality,7
193863,3595번,Zootopia,8,There are some good and funny moments and some bad and scary moments  But what really freaked me out was the Savage animal part with the panther and the otter  Seriously I was really scared  I had trouble sleeping  There was no hint of the violence in the trailer  But the rest was awesome and funny,6
193864,3595번,Zootopia,8,I went to the theater with my 8yearold brother and he was really scared because of the violence  I dont think 9yearolds can handle too much violence but 10yearolds yeah  They have the ESRB rating E10 which is similar to PG with mild violence  So it is suitable for those 10 and up  There could be some good messages there,5
193865,3595번,Zootopia,8,It is an awesome movie I saw it just a couple of days ago,2
193866,3595번,Zootopia,8,Note Spoiler,1
193867,3595번,Zootopia,8,Took my 6 yr old girls to this and I really wish I would have checked this website before hand because it was too scary for my sensitive girls   They were frightened most of the movie and cried a little too   The movie is fast paced and its about 90 scary parts   There wasnt enough light hearted or sweet or funny parts to balance out the scary   Over all it was a good movie with lots of great messages especially for what is going socially right now and the spectacle that this election has turned out to be     Its just not appropriate  for anyone under 8 or 9,6
193868,3595번,Zootopia,8,Before I saw it I thought that it wouldnt be great but I was wrong  There are great role models but there are some sort of intense chase scenes and towards the end Judy gets a cut that I had to look away from  although Im a  hemophobe   Overall it has good characters good lessons and awesome music,2
193869,3595번,Zootopia,8,This movie was amazing I want to be a director when I grow up and Im also type 1 diabetic if you dont know what that is PLEASE look it up so Judy inspired me a lot I loved the messages of prejudice and anyone can be anything  However there are a couple uses of darn one use of Oh My God and a couple uses of heck me and my family werent offended but other families might be  Also there were some families with toddlers and preschoolers who came to the theater  I didnt think they shouldve came because there were a couple scenes of savage animals going crazy  cough cough not rating Frozen G cough cough I was comfortable but there was one scene where the whole theater jumped out of their seats but I noticed at least 5 little kids leaving the theater early and 1 kid who made it to the end was crying and screaming Mama Papa in the parking lot  Dont send your little kids to this movie  Any kids who are 9 and older maybe mature 8 year olds teenagers and adults should go to this movie Me and my mom are planning on going to see it again and preordering it on Apple TV,12
193870,3595번,Zootopia,8,I saw Zootopia in the movie theater and the kids there were TERRIFIED  There was a scary for them jump scare in a scary setting  Also there was a lot of adult references but they would probably go over your kids head,3
193871,3595번,Zootopia,8,I saw it at the drivein  My brother totally SCREAMED HIS HEAD OFF and we had to leave early,3
193872,3595번,Zootopia,7,This is an excellent movie for older kids  There are references to drugs and Breaking Bad a tv show for adults,2
193873,3595번,Zootopia,7,Everything was great about this,1
193874,3595번,Zootopia,7,Ok so I suppose you may think Gazelle may dress a LITTLE skimpily but cmon it wasnt really revealing and kids probably wont think much of it  As for the scene where the animals are doing yoga sure they arent wearing anything but theyre ANIMALS for goodness sake   Most kids in the theatre just found it funny  The trailers are kind of misleading I suppose but the movie isnt too violent  Younger children and sensitive older children may be frightened by scenes such as SPOILER when Judy and Nick are chased by the panther but that isnt too scary to cause nightmares  There are also great messages like you can be what you want and it also encourages your children to fight stereotypes and prejudice  It also has many funny parts and the story is quite interesting and engaging  Although there are several frightening bits it is mostly light hearted humour  Overall a great movie for teens and older children about 10 and up as they are probably this movies target audience and also for adults I guess younger children about 7 to 10 may not get some parts but they should still enjoy the movie,9
193875,3595번,Zootopia,7,That was THE BEST movie EVER,1
193876,3595번,Zootopia,7,Zootopia is one of the best disney movies yet  it has great role models and good messages  You should really watch this one its one of the best,3
193877,3595번,Zootopia,7,I came to see Zootopia with my friends thinking it was going to be a goofy little kids movie    I was wrong Zootopia was absolutely amazing and beautiful  It really seemed to capture themes of following your dreams and standing up against bullies it was a very inspiring movie  HOWEVER  I would NOT recommend taking a child under the age of 8 to this movie  The trailers are extremely misleading there are plenty of scenes I can think of that are pretty violent and scary  During a particular scene that was supposed to be funny at the beginning many small children started crying and it was not a pleasant experience for them  The movie was more or less a crimedrama full of action and some comedy for adults  But if your child is mature welcome to Zootopia,9
193878,3595번,Zootopia,7,This was a beautiful movie full of lighthearted witty humor and plenty of sweet and poignant moments  Those saying that this is too scary or violent and sexual need to to put it bluntly get a thicker skin  This was an excellent film about tolerance I could have seen it at age five but gave it a 7 rating because of a jumpscare or two  I wholeheartedly recommend this for the entire family,4
193879,3595번,Zootopia,7,Good movie  Very creative  Sometimes a little scary  A little sad sort of  Liked it very much  My parents and 7 year old sister liked it to  Funny  Heart warming  Definitely worth seeing,9
193880,3595번,Zootopia,7,I think this movie is good for ages 10 and up because it was very intense and scary but it teaches you a lesson  I was very scared when the panther attacked the bunny and the fox  My little sister was so scared that she followed my mom all around the house,3
193980,3602번,추가리뷰 (12),7,Its a swashbuckling adventure that features the irresistible warrior cat,1
193981,3602번,추가리뷰 (12),7,It is hilarious but has some rude humor that adults will get but not little kids  It has some suitable lessons like trust and the bond between friends  My family enjoys it every time but personally I think it is best if whoever is watching it is at least 7 or 8,3
193982,3602번,추가리뷰 (12),7,This show is very good but I think the death character in this movie is too scary,1
193983,3602번,추가리뷰 (12),7,I loved everything about the movie most movies have a pros and cons list but I cant think of anything negative to say about this The pacing was good the villan atchually scared me and the story was easy to understand I didnt come out of the theater with questions as usual  I am putting 5 and up because they do reference curse words by bleeping the characters and cutting to another scene,5
193984,3602번,추가리뷰 (12),7,Funny sweethearted take on classic hero,1
193985,3602번,추가리뷰 (12),7,I have seen the 2011 SpinOff and it is one of my favorite DreamWorks SpinOffs next to Penguins Of Madagascar Guys its Puss In Boots thats the way he is you watched Shrek and it was inappropriate and Puss In Boots is a part of the Shrek Franchise,1
193986,3602번,추가리뷰 (12),7,Contains cartoonish fantasy violence throughout not many sexual content apart from Puss being coo over his flirtatious sidekick little to no profanity  There is a gag about how catnip mimics marijuana and how it cures Puss glaucoma,2
193987,3602번,추가리뷰 (12),7,Wella movie about Puss in Boots  It doesnt work 100with the wrting being somewhat weak and the new characters unmemorablebut at least Antonito reprises his role and the animation is good,2
193988,3602번,추가리뷰 (12),7,This movie should always have a five star rating   Its awesome Many people may like it,3
194158,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,The movie was terrible for me  I think it is only suitable for under 5 year olds who dont understand it and over 8 year olds who are already older  I was very sad about some scenes  I will never forget the movie,4

194161,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,Ice age is one of the best animated  films that I have ever seen it has great laughs great story score and cast too highly recommend it,1
194162,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,I love Ice Age,1
194163,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,I will says that is some but jokes but they will mostly hear those butt joke in daycare and school   The are some insane seen   It will teach your kid to trust and working together   Also have reabiltiy to trust again   It is aslo teach kids to not follow in peer preasure  It is funny    I will say it will be good starting shows for those who are learning to talk   It is always better to start earlier    I think those you rate 18 and plus are insane   The seen is a right amount of violence   I am okay to allow the acess with all kids   I seen many parents not supervising the kids and this how crazy you are so dont blame on you   It is better to keep this acess to kids and safe enviroment   I will mind keep your opion and my opion in oppositions    I think this will kids the improtant of trust  workship  teamword  and different meanings of family or herd or flock or school  fish   My 2nd grade teacher said  We are family and spread to school like a wild fire after from the ice age and we litimed to only one bully but he is not as bad as normal school bullys in other countries and states   It stay with also new added motto which is pretty similar to we are family   By the end of the day  We all are just the same  like water and rain,18
194164,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,Very good movie,1
194165,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,Ice Age is one of those newer classics   My brother and I love Sid the sloth a lot  He just cracks us up We also like when Diego says Wheres the baby There he is   It was peekaboo   I still feel bad for Manny that he lost his parents to humans but this movie is SO good  I understand why it got 82 in the reviews,7
194166,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,Parents can know that i like this film  It is amazing Especially if you are a Wooly Mammoth or a Giant Ground Sloth  I know you will like it   oh and by the way it was swell if you like california where they made the film  Bye earthlings  Im just so excited for my next review  My aliens and earthlings I bid you well  Oh and bye the way i like you  Bye,10
194167,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,As of 2020 there are five Ice Age movies and with the fifth being a failure it doesnt look like it will continue anytime soon,1
194168,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,Nobody should ever have to lay eyes on that monstrosity of a baby,1
194169,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,DO NOT let your children watch this terrible movie it truly is an abomination  The Ice Age Baby is maybe the worst thing ever and teaches a terrible messages  Parents should not even watch this they would  probably die,3
194170,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,I enjoy this film and think the cgi holds up  Has some violence but overall an enjoyable story that the family can watch  I thought it was good but surprised how big the franchise is now,3
194171,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,This movie is one of the best movie I seen on 2001 Its so unique and it really put the message out and what do you do for a family or your friends that you protect them from danger I think this is a really nice message to this and the movie is so awesome and the best I have seen when I was young,3
194172,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,Its a toddler movie theres no other way to put it  But the reason for 5 stars is because its one of them special kids movies that all ages can watch  Be curious with toddlers of 2 or under though there is some scary scenes,3
194173,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,I like this movie  It is about animals adventure,2
194174,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,Sort of cute movie but Manny is so annoying  Its a pretty cliche movie  Manny reminds me of Calliou and it sounds like his nose is clogged up the whole time    I strongly dislike this movie but the other ones are ok  Sid is just gross he makes me naseous but    MANNY RUINS IT ALL Do not watch,6
194175,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,okay this was one of the most boringest movies of all time its just so stupid dont watch this stupid movie I shut it off in the first 30 minutes  dont waste your money or time watching this,2
194176,3608번,추가리뷰 (18),8,Title says all,1
194222,3609번,추가리뷰 (19),7,This movie is great for kids with imagination or really anyone  It serves as a reminder that social outcast is no good and shows some kickass dragons along the way  If you havent seen it yet I dont know what your doing Give it a watch with your kid or by yourself you wont regret it,4
194223,3609번,추가리뷰 (19),7,I think that for 10 and up This shows a lot of caring and kind  It is also good for history,2
194224,3609번,추가리뷰 (19),7,Funny intense may scare younger kids great messages and role models gooood,1
194225,3609번,추가리뷰 (19),7,This movie is a work of art  Everything just fits together in the end and the characters have great development and the story is incredibly outstanding for a kids film,2
194226,3609번,추가리뷰 (19),7,How To Train Your Dragon is an animated blockbuster film in which a young boy named Hiccup who befriends a dragon named Toothless  It is a good movie for 6 and up,2
194227,3609번,추가리뷰 (19),7,It is a very interesting movie its fun and entertaining I have a lot of things in my head and heart that I cant type but I can say that I love that movie and I recommend it to a lot of people please watch the 3 movies and the 2 series,1
194228,3609번,추가리뷰 (19),7,I have been watching this movie since it came out when I was four years old  I really like that even when every viking expected the main character to kill a dragon he was brave and refused to do it  There was a cheesy crush that the main character had on a girl  The three minor things that I would warn about are 1  Teens talk about the scars they hope to get by battling dragons  2  The main characters Dad gifts him a helmet made from his Mothers old breastplate  3  There were some filler words like the common sense review said such as Thor almighty  I recommend this great movie to anybody who is thinking about watching it,10
194229,3609번,추가리뷰 (19),7,The end was scary so if you have any little kids ask them if they need to take a break   It has some sad parts but this is a kids movie so it will have a happy ending,2
194701,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,This bookbased adaption is the first epic chapter of the Harry Potter saga  Young kids will want to see this film and I say go ahead  But for some sensitive children the man with two faces you know who and Snape may scare young viewers  There is also some blood unicorn intense duels between wizards and neardeath situations involving the main characters,4
194702,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,I absolutely love the Harry Potter books and movies I readwatched them for the first time when I was 9 years old   They are indescribably ingenious I cannot think of one flaw   Everything about them is excellent  This is a mustsee,5
194703,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,Just love this movie ON for everyone Its a bit scary and violent but ON 100 ON WATCH IT,4
194704,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,This film is delightful and exciting it delivers a great message but may be too repetitive and it is a bit too far fetched the thing was he appeared to make no mistakes and he was perfect the whole way through  And this is were the film trips up  It will be plain boring if he does not do something wrong or have a weakness  But the plot gripped me in,4
194705,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,My rating PG for brief violence,1
194706,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,This is a good start to the world of sci fi movies kids will especially enjoy this teens maybe  There is nothing at all inappropriate about this movie it could actually be rated G the only part that may scare kids is the man with Voldemort on the back of his head  Overall you really just need to know your child,3
194707,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,Spoiler Alert At the part where they go to the zoo and Dudley is pressed up against the glass he pushes Harry and Harry is on the concrete floor and the glass disappears and Dudley falls in  Thats the funny part   The exciting part is when he encounters the mirror of Erised the third time because the first dark arts teacher has the head of Voldemort on the back and he has the power to throw fire from his hand when he encounters Harry  When Harry wakes up hes in the hospital wing and Dumbledore is with him,5
194708,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,If you would like wizards and witches this is the movie for you   Be warned  If youre afraid of ghosts choose a different movie cause it has ghosts in it,2
194709,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,Harry Potter takes place in Hogwarts wizarding world of London  It is about a boy named Harry Potter who goes to the wizarding world  It has some violence with wands but no guns or stuff like that  There is some swearing but the movie has some positive messages and positive role models  I recommend kids age 10 and up can watch harry potter movies with an adult,5
194710,3611번,추가리뷰 (20),6,This movie is when Harry first arrives at Hogwarts  It was really true to the book there were some skipped parts  I like Harry Potter because he always goes on adventures,3
194911,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),6,very very weird pretty bad graphics too  more comedy than scary  not scary at all,3
194912,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),6,This is a really great classic movie  Its not a masterpiece obviously but its really funny A few scenes needed for skipping like implied sexual content that is never shown but you definitely can tell what is going on  We skipped these scenes obviously so I recommend you do the same  The language isnt too bad  This move now days I believe would be rated PG13 but its still really funny and I think everyone should watch it because its such a  classic  One more question for you     who you gonna call,7
194913,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),6,This movie was disappointing because of the sexual content and notevencomical stupidity  PG is not a good rating for this movie,2
194914,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),6,You need to know at the 3rd scene there is a really scary ghost its about 10mins in the movie its when the ghostbusters come to check the library and near the end off the scene the ghost screams and turns in a skeleton and theres another scene when one of the ghostbusters dreams of a ghost and it is not appropriate for younger kids,1
194915,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),6,This is a really funny movie but has some questionable material,1
194916,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),6,Good for ages 11  It has some violence sex and swearing,2
194917,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),6,Ghostbusters is an awesome movie but theres plenty of swearing  I would rate this movie PG13 for the language  Also in most scenes one of the ghostbusters is smoking a cigarette  For a mature audience I definitely recommend this movie,5
194918,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),6,A LITTLE SCARY FOR KIDS ,1
194919,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),6,The ghosts look really good animated and so are the proton streams,1
194939,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,My rating pg13 for some violence implied sex some language including 2 dks and smoking,1
194940,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,This movie was just average to me  It was nothing too special just a little comedy that tries a bit too hard  But with all i can say about this movie I can definitely say that this is a classic just because of the stay puft marshmallow man  Over all just a decent movie,4
194941,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,Good movie,1
194942,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,This iconic movie may appear to be a scary horror movie however when you actually sit down to watch it you will realise that it is not at all scary other than a few brief appearances of ghosts  It is worth noting however that there are many hidden sexual innuendos in this movie but whether this movie is suitable for children depends upon whether they understand the sex jokes or not  All in all it is a great and hilarious classic,3
194943,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,Classic comedy is alright but lacks something     ,1
194944,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,I dont feel I even need to write a full review  Its a creative original fun and action packed classic  If you havent already then what are you still doing here GO see it right now,4
194945,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,I LOVE Ghostbusters 1 and 2,1
194946,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,This is my favorite movie but there are a few negative elements I suggest vidangeling out ghost oral sex launguege  This has great messages including teamwork and friendship,2
194947,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,This film is from the 80s and like most films from that timeline it has language the s word is said at least 5 times in the film one of the characters has a dream where he gets Oral pleasure from a ghost  And Peter is a borderline sexual predator  overall great film but not for small kids,3
194948,3613번,추가리뷰 (22),8,I liked the movie but it can be scary for younger kids It also includeslanguageLots of smokingand in some scenes lots of sex Crude humor is in Ghostbusters too,1
195097,3614번,추가리뷰 (23),7,This movie is very funny and has messages about how you should always have a smile on your face and care about others,1
195098,3614번,추가리뷰 (23),7,This movie is downright funny there is plenty of laughs and it never gets old This movie is one of the best Christmas ever made  not only does it keep in rage with its rating PG it is actaully a bit purecleaner than most Christmas movies well the Polar Express is cleanerpurer than this movie  I think this movie is for everyone to see  Although there is one suggestive moment with showering it is not too explicitgrpahic for young kids not to see  There is one upsetting scene where Buddys dad yells at him to get out of his life  But overall this movie delivers the fun and magic of Christmas and the true spirit of it Infrequent mild language crap piss etc  is heard but dont be too worried about that,8
195099,3614번,추가리뷰 (23),7,Ferrells gross heartwarming fish out of water holiday story is clever has messages about differences family and belief and has spectacular goofy acting,1
195100,3614번,추가리뷰 (23),7,This is SUCH a good film and its great for families There are some very positive messages in this film  There is some language like hell dmn son of a nutcracker up yours and shut up  And some iffy stuff like in one scene Buddy goes to a shopping mall and sees a red bra with white feathers on display and takes it and holds it up so he can see it in other scene he hears a women singing which finds out to be the girl he likes and yet shes singing in a shower naked  nudity is not shown but bare shoulders and arms are  There is also a bit of drinking  Buddy is as great role model because he is joyful and nice and has the Christmas spirit  This movie gets 5 stars and is intended for kids of the age nine and up,6
195101,3614번,추가리뷰 (23),7,Elf is amazing It teaches kids to love themselves no matter how different they may be and it teaches kids to value family over everything else The worst it gets is a scene with some alcohol in it but besides that it is cleaner than a germaphobes house,3
195102,3614번,추가리뷰 (23),7,Its a great movie perfect for Christmas time I watch it yearly and it never gets old  Not to mention it is very funny  The only reason I rated it 7 is because children under 7 might not understand certain parts of it   It also has a good message in it to always remember the meaning of Christmas and to spread Christmas cheer whenever you can  The father in this movie is a very mean person at the beginning and then changes for the good at the end  That is a good role model,7
195103,3614번,추가리뷰 (23),7,This is a funny entertaining classic with good characters and writing  id recommend it for families looking for a fun Christmas movie  My suggested age rating would would be PG parental guidance for mild violence and some rude humour,3
195104,3614번,추가리뷰 (23),7,Elf is the story of Buddy the Elf  a man who grows up making toys for Santa in the North Pole  He decides to take a trip to New York City to find his biological father and has several misadventures upon his arrival  This movie is adorable sweet and funny with a couple of iffy spots here and there   Its probably best not to show this to kids who still believe in Santa Claus  Aside from that there is a scene where Buddy innocently goes into the womens locker room so he can listen to the girl he likes singing in the shower and a couple of fight scenes  Other than that its a great movie that your kids will probably love,6
195105,3614번,추가리뷰 (23),7,I thought Elf was funny It really shows the Christmas spirit,1
195265,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Dora the explorer is basiclly about a girl and a monkey and together they go on adventures  I loved the show when i was 36  and i think prechooler would enjoy the show  She learn kids some basic spanish like hola and bien   Parents might get irritated of the opening since the lyrics is the name  dodododora yelled randomly to the music  I dont get why everyone hates when she say things like what was your favourite part and replays It was mine too or something like that but what is she supposed to say  I hate hat part or something similar Like csm said there is a bunch of dora toys clothing  games etc  The show gets too much hate its a show for kids after all,8
195266,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Although Dora is likable to some people I am well on the contrary to that  Swiper is too scary to sensitive viewers and is a bad example to kids  He teaches them how to steal stuff from other Her shirt is too small and exposes her belly button People between the ages of 2 and 5 are too young to learn Spanish  They barely know how to talk yet  The worst part is that this show may teach Mexican children and parents how to sneak into the United States illegally due to her overinspiring nature about adventure culture and her willingness to travel the world and having too much perseverance to inspire people to become fugitives  Plus it is too dangerous to go miles away from their home alone with a monkey named Boots  They could get killed by a serial killer get lost even with map and go to dangerous places they have no idea about  Overall this show is no good at all to people,10
195267,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Dora goes to completely unrealistic places and the antagonist Swiper the Fox is a complete fool,1
195268,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,this show is anoying,1
195269,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,cuz she screams and stuff  And is violent n stuff  do nit watch,3
195270,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,OkayI used to LOVE thishad a lot of DVDS but the main problem is that the plot is always the same,1
195271,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Dora has a rabid monkey she runs into the forest with it  She doesnt tell her parents when she leaves  All in all Dora is a bad example for children,3
195272,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,All they have to do to stop Swiper is say Swiper no swiping and then he says Awwwwww meaaaaaan and he goes away  Thats absolutely stupid If Swiper is the villain why does he listen to Dora and Boots,5
195273,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,It barleys teaches spanishit steaches bad stuff like talking to strangers and playing wity animals that could he dangerous or have diseaseits anoying to dont bother,1
195274,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,It is educational for little kids,1
195275,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,i cant believe that people would let their kids watch this  HER BELLY IS SHOWING PEOPLE,3
195276,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,I Hate This Show Its Retarded  Annoying   Horrible And Bad  Children Should Never Watch This Show They Should Watch Proper Kids Shows Like Bob The Builder Or Thomas The Tank Engine And Friends Or Fireman Sam Or Pingu,1
195277,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Dora the Explorer is a really amazing show  It sends great messages for kids ages 2 to 10  Its also funny and it can teach kids to talk a little Spanish and be super nice to other people  Thats why Dora the Explorer is a really amazing show for kids to watch  There is nothing negitive about the show at all,5
195278,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,I think Dora is a great remodel for children  I would totally recommend Dora,3
195279,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Not only does it teach kids Spanish the wrong way seems to suck at pronunciation but their method is to say something in Spanish without saying what it means  It turns this otherwise unremarkable Nicktoon into barely comprehensible crap that has plenty of errors and has annoying characters bad writing obnoxious songs and mediocre animation,2
195280,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Goatworlds here  Mediocre animation bad plot no action crappy adventures pathetic voiceacting and unlikable characters  Swiper the braindead fox is horrible at stealing He gives anything back when they say Swiper no swiping Just a girl and her monkey go on crappy adventures,5
195281,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Dora wants kids to yell  Its okay for her to teach Spanish but yelling louder and teaching kids to jump of something What if kids are playing Dora and they jump of a table Do you even like the Grumpy Old Troll to scare kids with his scary lines Swiper the Fox is mean He steals something in every episode Kids will learn stealing  Shes so annoying The laet time I liked watching Dora was when I was 7 Id rather rewatch Team,10
195282,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,The show is just stupid  The characters are just stupid  There is nothing promising about this TV series  It is great for 25 year olds but then it is just idiotic  The show is part of the larger Dora The Explorer Franchise and the creators are more interested in making money off kids,5
195283,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Dont watch it much but its allright,1
195304,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Ugh this show is SO IRRATATING  It gives me a headache  A really bad one  The songs are so annoying the acting is crappy and there is NOTHING good about this crapfest,4
195305,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Parents and kids from ages 07 will love Dora but trust me things will start to change once you hit ages 817  Youll just think that its a bunch o Swiper no swiping trash  Believe me I went through that phase myself  The only reason I still watch this is because I have a 1year old sister going through the short phase in life where she enjoys Nick Jr,5
195306,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Hate it u know what I dont really know where to start but you know what Ill just talk about swiper yea wat is wrong with him when for and her friends go swiper no swiping he goes OOOO MAANN like what is it with him if he is really soo bad y doesnt he just steal it I mean cmon hes one of the worst tv characters Ive ever known about except for mike the knight he is stupid also,1
195307,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,This show is so annoying and lame  I cant stand the songs  They are stupid and annoying  The characters are so crappy  There is not 1 good thing I can think about Dora the Explorer,5
195308,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Okay I can understand some of the hate but theres no need to say its not for kids  Yes Dora does ask where certain things are when they are right behind her but shes trying to let little kids guess  Once your kid is about 6 they will start to hate Dora but toddlers will love it,3
195309,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,This show so bad its almost comical  The plot is screwed up  A girl and a monkey go on crappy adventures  The animation is HORRIBLY drawn the acting is atrocious the characters are unlikeable and the theme song is just horrible  This is the 2nd worst show ever with the worst being Incredible Crew  Please Nick Jr cancel this garbage and dont give it any reruns  Oh and parents skip this crap and try 64 Zoo Lane,7
195310,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,I bleeping hate this show  It sucks  Too much breaking the fourth wall and the songs are so stupid you might think that your brain melted  Yes its that crappy,4
195311,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY I LOVED THIS SHOW NOW WE HAVE THIS STUPIDITY TO DEAL WITH DONT BOTHER ITS BAD ITS SO BAD IT MAKES ME WANNA PUKE BECAUSE IT HAS GONE DOWNHILL DO NOT WATCH Dear God please cancel this show,5
195312,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,How can anyone like this show It is really annoying and it breaks the fourth wall too much  It gives me headaches it burns my eyes and that is my BIGGEST objection to this show  It was good when they broke the fourth wall on Blues Clues but this No way  I can go on and on but my review is just going to be 4 rants on Dora the Explorer  Is Nick Jr REALLY desperate for ratings So desperate they must put on crappy shows jamming in little kids heads Obviously so  Lastly has anyone noticed that Dora and boots walk on a road with NO SIDEWALKS They can get injured  Nick Jr needs to come up with little kid shows that has the abilty to entertain not just little kids but also older kids and adults  But instead they are making crappy shows that give you headaches  I hope this show gets cancelled  RANT 2 When I was watching this crap while babysitting it was so bad I actually felt pain in my chest  Yes it was that bad  Honestly what was Nick Jr thinking I have so many questions for the creator but I cant think of them all  Whats the deal with the theme song It is so annoying  Lastly does anyone else hate that they break the fourth wall too much In Blues Clues they made breaking the fourth wall fun  Blues Clues was my childhood and its a shame Nick Jr took it off the air  Sadly they let Dora stay on the air  No fair  Dora should be cancelled and Blues Clues should return  Blues Clues rules  Dora is moronic and dimented  Dora the Explorer is crap  Blues Clues is much better  OK rant 2 was a little too long  But still Dora sucks really badly  I love to bash shows I hate with a passion and I also love saluting shows I love  Dora is a show I really hate  RANT 3 This show is so bad it hurts  Im not joking I cant believe how bad it is  Who came up with this idiotfest I have LOTS of questions for the creators of this crap but I cant think of them all  If anyone else agrees with me ask the creators of this show some of the questions I have for them  This is the worst little kids show of alltime but its also one of my most hated shows in general  Finally I cant help but notice that they break the fourth wall on this crap  That is the biggest objection I have to Dora the Explorer  It was good when they broke the fourth wall on Blues Clues but this show FAILS at breaking the fourth wall  RANT 4 Is there some kind of inside joke in this show that im not getting This show is super painful to watch  Who came up with this junk I have so many other questions that I want to ask the creator of this show but I cant think of the all  If anyone agrees with me im honored  Lastly has anyone noticed that this show FAILS at breaking the fourth wall Blues clues did a great job at breaking the fourth wall  Dora however is the COMPLETE OPPISITE  Dora and Boots are annoying people  They are such sy characters sorry for the foul laungage  Blues Clues was my childhood and its a shame Nick Jr took it off the air  To make matters worse they put on Dora  Which is moronic crap  Have I bashed this show enough I think so,58
195313,3615번,추가리뷰 (24),8,Well hmm          Dora is okay     but I wouldnt recommend it for kids over 6 But I love Boots I like the culture and Spanish words that they teach  So I think its better than ALOT of shows,3
195643,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,Went to the movies theater when it came out AMAZING MOVIE was my favorite movies till spiderman into the spider verse came outcheck out my review on that Mild violence one middle finger not recommended for small children great movie though,1
195644,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,This is possibly the best Marvel movie so far  The action is awesome the story is great and the characters are interesting and diverse  Some of the violence may be too much for younger kids  There are a lot of shootings and deaths  Michael B  Jordans character is cruel and disturbing at times  12 and up,6
195645,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,i realy like this movie you should let your kids watch this movie,1
195646,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,This was not my favorite but its ok  There is some swearing but not much  It has a great storyboard and I think it is fine for a mature eight year old,3
195647,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,THIS IS INCREDIBLE This movie is my perfect marvel movie  I love everything I love how this movie has so much emotion and is so powerful it will really tugs at the heartstrings  It has a perfect balance of action emotion plot everything in between  Most marvel movies have men characters but this movie has awesome women warrior characters my favorites are Shuri Okoye Nakia and let me just say Everyone  This is my all time favorite Marvel Movie Watch it,8
195648,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,Message a teamwork and loyalty  The first black hero and a message on never giving up Fightingexplosions and even A death happen in the movie Stand Hell are said infrequently  No Real sex in this movie  Its Part of the marvel cinematic universe Some Drinking in one scene,3
195649,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,Great film  Favorite Marvel film so far,2
195650,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,This movie is one of the best I have ever watched in my life but it did use consumerism violence and swearing  Though it had these it conveyed great messages and inspired us to support everyone no matter their background  It did not use sex or drugdrinkingsmoking but I would still recommend watching it with a parent or a group of friends  But if you are  8 and understand certain words are bad then I think you could still watch it,4
195651,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,This is a really good movies for families There are a couple violent scenes and SPOILER the guy who tries to take over Wakanda is a little creepy with the knifescarthing on his upper body      but a good movie for celebrating black families Another thing a VERY good movie to watch right now especially with COVID and the BLACK LIVES MATTER thing  Great family movie definitly would watch again and probaly will,4
195662,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),6,TOO MUCH VIOLENCE  FOR KIDS,2
195663,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),6,this is a good movie I recommend this,1
195664,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),6,I thought that this movie was good but kids under 13 might have a hard time following it understanding it  Also the violence was really intense  But I thought that it had good messages and role models,3
195665,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),6,It has swearing and Blood and the religion might be confusing for Kids,1
195666,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),6,i think this movie is great its just kinda violent thats all,1
195667,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),6,This movie will be good to take an 10 year old out to see a movie but mild language is my concern,1
195668,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),6,This movie gives info about the strength of black people everybody knows that black panther represents the strength of black people and it just says damn hell sht and other BUT its great  At the end of the movie tchalla and nakia kiss  but its not to sexual  and the movie puts out great messages,4
195669,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),6,well there is quite a lot of violence characters get stabbed multiple times murder as punishment etc remind your kid or teen that this is just acting and special effects  Also there is some positivity in it  It has a message that no matter what race you are you can still do many great things  but one part I didnt like was that two characters kiss at the end  blah   There is a minimal amount of swearing  I grew up around swear words and such so if you dont want your kidteen hearing that I recommend not watching this with youre kidteen  I hope this review helped you in some way,7
195698,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,Ive seen marvel movies better than thissuch as Thor  Although it is good it has some violent scene  Rude moments suggestive and blood is seen  I think this is better than Doctor Strange but this is still a boring MARVEL movie  Kids should not see this movie by it self,5
195699,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,This movie is awesome action packed and gets you on the edge of your seat  Quite violent though,2
195700,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,Black Panther is a beautiful movie with an excellent storyline and positive role models  It really values the importance of culture and diversity and supports equality for all females and males,2
195701,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,it is very good and full of action,1
195702,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,This is a great movie There is a lot of violence  But there is no blood  There is lots of positive messages too   I think this is appropriate for tweens,5
195703,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,Amazing film with fun drama and superhero action,1
195704,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,Fine movie  Watched like a million times  Knowing marvel movies this ones on the more graphic violent side but its not the worst  There are several scenes of bloody punching and stabbing and one seen of aman laying on the ground and is shot  Nothing sexual,5
195705,3619번,추가리뷰 (28),8,It was a great movie that includes action adventure and story  A good movie about culture May be intense for younger children,2
196050,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,More special effects thann anything else  Lots of violence as well as almost constant swearing including some brief sexual references  and more,2
196051,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,This action epic tale of survival is a must see by James Cameron  Though the story is sometimes rough the heart in it is that a disabled man has the commitment to not follow his orders and protect a planet called Pandora  But parents beware there are some extremely frightening and violent scenes that some children cannot watch because of the intensity of them  There is one brief mating scene kissing plus flirting and the Navi are barely dressed  There is lots of strong language st holy st bullst and milder words but there are no Fbombs  Although this film has some content that is not for kids Avatar is fine for mature 12yearolds and up,6
196052,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,This movie isnt as good as everybody says it is,1
196053,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,Avatar is an great movie for kids 11  The language I can handle but the naked people was RIDICULOUS Like whywearanyclothes naked OO The messages the movie is sending are good though  The People blue people are working together and are always watching out for each other  Another thing I liked was that The People were trying the preserve their earth and the other people were destroying it  Again I would say only 11 year olds  should watch this movie  Thanks for reading ,7
196054,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,This is a good movie  However you may want to watch this with your family,2
196055,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,Avatar is a very good movie for tweens teens and adults in my opinion  When I saw this movie I absolutely loved it Even though Im just a kid I have to say that this movie was very inspiring  It shows a great planet with magnificent scenery and landscapes   however it can be depressing to some because of all that  As our planet is being destroyed we see a beautiful planet onscreen  I can understand how that could be disturbing to some people,6
196056,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,Its thrilling lovely sad and explosive in all the right ways  Once again Director James Cameron has delivered an extraordinary film  There is at least one man in Hollywood who knows how to spend 250 million wisely to create an excellent actionpacked visual spectacle,3
196057,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,cbhfh,1
196058,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,Avatar was overall a pretty good movie  There is quite a lot of violence like people killing each other with guns machine guns and bow and arrows  There is also heavy dutie explosions that may be to intence for younger viewers  There is only one scene featuring sensuality  There is quite a bit of language that is not always necessary  There is not very much drinking drugs or smoking except one of the lead characters smokes a couple of times  Otherwise I really enjoyed Avatar,7
196059,3620번,추가리뷰 (29),3,Oh My God there is a lot of language  I mean whenever someone said a bad word  I just froze  And I am not begiining to trust Comen Sence Media  Because in the end war a girl said  Not the only one with a gun u Bich,6
196455,3621번,추가리뷰 (3),8,I love this movie It is a great one of the first MCU movies you should show your kids,1
196456,3621번,추가리뷰 (3),8,Why is this only 12 plus I think that the main form of violence was just in a bit of martial arts and Thors hammer creating storms  There was a point where a robot shot heat at them and flipped over a bunch of cars  There was no swearing that I can recall there was one kiss that was about it  Great special effects a few comedy moments and an amazing plot  I loved this movie and I think you will to,6
196457,3621번,추가리뷰 (3),8,It is funny and has some fighting but it is still not scary,1
196458,3621번,추가리뷰 (3),8,Thor is an interesting idea  To spin Norse mythology into a superhero film is a challenging risk but it paid off  The change of an impulsive and ignorant son to a loving and strong leader is astonishing  Nothing really bad but some action violence non gory and one character gets drunk  Who doesnt love Loki Seriously  Go watch Thor and the rest of the MCU,7
196459,3621번,추가리뷰 (3),8,has actionviolence throughout,1
196460,3621번,추가리뷰 (3),8,Thor is kinda thicc but could be thiccer  Thor and Spooderman have a cool battle and almost kill each other  Sexy squidward tries to kiss Thor but does not get to  This is a ok movie that could be a little thiccer,4
196461,3621번,추가리뷰 (3),8,marvel has made another great  action pact movie but its about gods  All in all this is a great action movie with very little fighting and some kissing  For violence  there are fight scenes  Frost giants throw ice spikes and attempt to stab people with ice  when touched by a ice giant some of there skin turn purple  Someone does get stabbed  The frost giant leader almost kills oden  but loki blasts him away with a beam  Loki attempts to kill thor with a metal suit that shoots energy beams there are exploding cars but no gets killed  At one point there is blood on thors face  In the beginning thor gets tazed by a girl  thor beats of a bunch of S H I E L D agents there is no blood  There is one big kiss at the end and thor is shown shirtless not sexually  All in all this is a great movie that your 11 year old needs to see at some point in hisher life,13
196462,3621번,추가리뷰 (3),8,ok movie but good for younger kids who cant watch other marvel movies yet,1
196463,3621번,추가리뷰 (3),8,Great movie but extremely violent and kind of scary  I saw it because I always watch things above my age,2
197418,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,,2
197419,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,I was OBSESSED with this movie It has quite a bit of violence but its not horrible  There is not that much swearing  The reason why I give 10 and up is because theres nothing horrible in this movie  If you like the series divergent you would like this movie A LOT,5
197420,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,The movie tells the story of Katniss Everdeen in a competition with 24 other contestants and only 1 can live  There is not much blood but some scenes are very violent and somewhat suspenseful  Katniss is a strong role model too,3
197421,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,Parents Katniss is one of the best role models I have ever seen   The movie is pretty violent though it is not afraid to show some blood  Critical This film is a thought provoking adventure about a future world which celebrates a battle to the death disguised as a reality show known only as the Hunger Games  The second hour is very intense THIS PART WAS RETARDED My only complaint is that it is too long before the titular conflict starts  Overall 4 65,5
197422,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,This is REALLY violent You better read the book or see the 2nd movie You see a LOT of blood and its more for like a 11 year old or a MATURE 10 YEAR OLD if you really LOVE your  9 year old  up kids dont watch this Its VERY scary but the Second movie is good 10 up can see catching fire D D,7
197423,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,I liked it when I watched it then I went to go see catching fire and now I hate this film along with Catching fire  The dumbest movies I have ever witnessed  Too violent sad and WAY too intense  But is there anything good about this movie Well I like the soundtrack and I can tell that it was very well edited and they did a great job on it  I just dont like it,6
197424,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,Its a great book full of emotions and struggles  I wouldnt recommend this for younger kids since its got mature themes,2
197425,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,There is a lot of violence  This is something to look into because the movie is really all about an event that is all out violence  There is some swearing and not too much but a bit of sexual content  There is also drinking  So before letting a 10yearold see this movie see what they can and cant handle,5
197426,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,The movie was as good as the book and almost have the same scenes as the book  You should really watch the movie first then read the book because when i try reading the book at age 10 it was kind of hard to understand so i decided to wait for the movie to come out and see what happens  I understand way better after seeing the movie so i read the book and now i understand everything But readers i dont recommend this movie to anyone under 15 because of the violence and the gore,4
197427,3628번,추가리뷰 (6),7,The movie is fine except at the beginning its really boring  There is some violence I dont really remember most of it but it wasnt too bad  Oh ya at one part the creepy dogs were scary  I think most kids would be ok with it if they can skip the kissing There is some kissing  I didnt have nightmares or anything from the movie  Its no worse than Iron Man and those movies  Almost the same for violence and action  I guess you just have to know if your kid would be ok with it  My mom and dad knew I would be ok,10
198364,3640번,포켓몬~ (11),8,At level one the game is fairly boring but that makes getting a buddy at level five feel great  There arent many Pokmon to catch if you just sit there which is frustrating at times but also promotes being active which some parents might appreciate  The game really starts to pick up around levels 1520 and it takes a week or two to get there but Id say its worth it for better CP Pokmon and a real chance at winning battles  Its actually really fun if youre willing to walk around and get the hang of the controls  The IV system is a bit frustrating and beginners dont know how to use it resulting in the discard of potentially great Pokmon  My main issue with this game is the intense consumerism  The game clearly cares a LOT about money as opposed to customer experience which is sad but the customer experience is honestly fine anyways  I said a lot of negative things about the game in this review but the truth is its quite fun,8
198365,3640번,포켓몬~ (11),8,Hi my name is blue Ive been playing Pokmon go for 6 years Its super fun  Every month they have something called a community day which you can catch exclusive shiny Pokmon which encourages you to go outside and have fun  I rate this game for 4 because it could be confusing for under 4 and under 4 doesnt really know how to walk on a road nor use a phone so it would be useless to let them play   There is some stufff that cost money and sometimes some events are rigged to get you to pay for stuff like incense but you can still play  FREE 2 PLAY and get far in the game  All in all I love this game and I ALWAYS will,7
198366,3640번,포켓몬~ (11),8,Exciting active game marred by privacy and safety issues,1
198367,3640번,포켓몬~ (11),8,Pokmon GO is better to play with friends than alone  its great to trade with other trainers so you or the other trainer can get the Pokmon you want,1
198368,3640번,포켓몬~ (11),8,This game is completely good for kids,1
198369,3640번,포켓몬~ (11),8,Pokemon GO is a good game  I love playing and I am a Level 14 Trainer as a part of Team Valor  WARNING CENSORED FOR DIFFICULTY,3
198370,3640번,포켓몬~ (11),8,Loppunnythicc,1
198371,3640번,포켓몬~ (11),8,It is absolutely amazing This is just so cool  If you want a game thats just full of cool Pokmon and encourages you to get a lot of exercise a day then play this Like one time I was looking for a specific Pokmon and I walked about seven miles that day I got so much exercise Its amazing how they designed it where you have to walk to make Pokmon appear  And there are so many addones like raids where it encourages people to get together with each other and tap their phone screen to use their personal Pokmon to defeat a very strong Pokmon  Once the raid is over you will have a chance to catch the Pokmon you battled and it can be shiny Shiny means that it is a different colour to what it would normally look like and shinies are very rare  But some raids like mega raids have a Pokmon that is in its mega form  When you do raid battles like say against a Pokmon called Mega Banette instead of catching it in its mega form you catch it as a normal Baynette and it gives you enough mega energy to mega evolve that Pokmon so you have to collect lots of mega energy if you want to evolve your Pokmon You can get shinies in the wild and there are Pokestops  They are blue spinnable disks that you swipe on your screen to make them spin  Once you do that it will give you helpful items like Pokeballs,14
198449,3642번,포켓몬~ (3),7,Look at POGGGGIEBOYSSSs review in this page XD,2
198450,3642번,포켓몬~ (3),7,its family friendly and good and cooool Im now,1
198479,3648번,포켓몬~ (9),7,Sure the movie has Pikachu saying half of the S Word and Tim or Lucy saying the full S Word but other than that it is a great movie for kids 8,1
198480,3648번,포켓몬~ (9),7,I think this movie is awesome There are false suspects and it incorporates a funny Pikachu,2
198481,3648번,포켓몬~ (9),7,its a great movie to watch it may have some words lthat are inappropriate but its not too big of a deal and if we take out the inappropriate words its a perfect pg movie although i do recommend this to be a movie for kids who are 11 years or older,1
198482,3648번,포켓몬~ (9),7,this is for kids there isnt anything inappropriate there is some violence but not bloody or gory there isnt anything sexual maybe like a tiny bit but not a whole lot,1
198483,3648번,포켓몬~ (9),7,I really liked this film and other families should see it too  It might not be for young and sensitive kids but I enjoyed it  There was some dark humor but I didnt care because I kinda like dark humor    D,3
198484,3648번,포켓몬~ (9),7,This movie is so good especially since Ive been playing the original red and blue all the way up to sword and shield pokemon games  This movie I entirely recommend  It definitely could be described as a fun quirky but slightly dark movie  It might get a bit creppy when you see the ditto I hate all the people who said slimy pokemon hes my favorite And It gives a lot of character  The film was very original I love it,6
198485,3648번,포켓몬~ (9),7,Greatyt,1
199174,4번,Black Panther,8,Went to the movies theater when it came out AMAZING MOVIE was my favorite movies till spiderman into the spider verse came outcheck out my review on that Mild violence one middle finger not recommended for small children great movie though,1
199175,4번,Black Panther,8,This is possibly the best Marvel movie so far  The action is awesome the story is great and the characters are interesting and diverse  Some of the violence may be too much for younger kids  There are a lot of shootings and deaths  Michael B  Jordans character is cruel and disturbing at times  12 and up,6
199176,4번,Black Panther,8,i realy like this movie you should let your kids watch this movie,1
199177,4번,Black Panther,8,This was not my favorite but its ok  There is some swearing but not much  It has a great storyboard and I think it is fine for a mature eight year old,3
199178,4번,Black Panther,8,THIS IS INCREDIBLE This movie is my perfect marvel movie  I love everything I love how this movie has so much emotion and is so powerful it will really tugs at the heartstrings  It has a perfect balance of action emotion plot everything in between  Most marvel movies have men characters but this movie has awesome women warrior characters my favorites are Shuri Okoye Nakia and let me just say Everyone  This is my all time favorite Marvel Movie Watch it,8
199179,4번,Black Panther,8,Message a teamwork and loyalty  The first black hero and a message on never giving up Fightingexplosions and even A death happen in the movie Stand Hell are said infrequently  No Real sex in this movie  Its Part of the marvel cinematic universe Some Drinking in one scene,3
199180,4번,Black Panther,8,Great film  Favorite Marvel film so far,2
199181,4번,Black Panther,8,This movie is one of the best I have ever watched in my life but it did use consumerism violence and swearing  Though it had these it conveyed great messages and inspired us to support everyone no matter their background  It did not use sex or drugdrinkingsmoking but I would still recommend watching it with a parent or a group of friends  But if you are  8 and understand certain words are bad then I think you could still watch it,4
199182,4번,Black Panther,8,This is a really good movies for families There are a couple violent scenes and SPOILER the guy who tries to take over Wakanda is a little creepy with the knifescarthing on his upper body      but a good movie for celebrating black families Another thing a VERY good movie to watch right now especially with COVID and the BLACK LIVES MATTER thing  Great family movie definitly would watch again and probaly will,4
199193,4번,Black Panther,6,TOO MUCH VIOLENCE  FOR KIDS,2
199194,4번,Black Panther,6,this is a good movie I recommend this,1
199195,4번,Black Panther,6,I thought that this movie was good but kids under 13 might have a hard time following it understanding it  Also the violence was really intense  But I thought that it had good messages and role models,3
199196,4번,Black Panther,6,It has swearing and Blood and the religion might be confusing for Kids,1
199197,4번,Black Panther,6,i think this movie is great its just kinda violent thats all,1
199198,4번,Black Panther,6,This movie will be good to take an 10 year old out to see a movie but mild language is my concern,1
199199,4번,Black Panther,6,This movie gives info about the strength of black people everybody knows that black panther represents the strength of black people and it just says damn hell sht and other BUT its great  At the end of the movie tchalla and nakia kiss  but its not to sexual  and the movie puts out great messages,4
199200,4번,Black Panther,6,well there is quite a lot of violence characters get stabbed multiple times murder as punishment etc remind your kid or teen that this is just acting and special effects  Also there is some positivity in it  It has a message that no matter what race you are you can still do many great things  but one part I didnt like was that two characters kiss at the end  blah   There is a minimal amount of swearing  I grew up around swear words and such so if you dont want your kidteen hearing that I recommend not watching this with youre kidteen  I hope this review helped you in some way,7

199460,9번,Ghostbusters,6,very very weird pretty bad graphics too  more comedy than scary  not scary at all,3
199461,9번,Ghostbusters,6,This is a really great classic movie  Its not a masterpiece obviously but its really funny A few scenes needed for skipping like implied sexual content that is never shown but you definitely can tell what is going on  We skipped these scenes obviously so I recommend you do the same  The language isnt too bad  This move now days I believe would be rated PG13 but its still really funny and I think everyone should watch it because its such a  classic  One more question for you     who you gonna call,7
199462,9번,Ghostbusters,6,This movie was disappointing because of the sexual content and notevencomical stupidity  PG is not a good rating for this movie,2
199463,9번,Ghostbusters,6,You need to know at the 3rd scene there is a really scary ghost its about 10mins in the movie its when the ghostbusters come to check the library and near the end off the scene the ghost screams and turns in a skeleton and theres another scene when one of the ghostbusters dreams of a ghost and it is not appropriate for younger kids,1
199464,9번,Ghostbusters,6,This is a really funny movie but has some questionable material,1
199465,9번,Ghostbusters,6,Good for ages 11  It has some violence sex and swearing,2
199466,9번,Ghostbusters,6,Ghostbusters is an awesome movie but theres plenty of swearing  I would rate this movie PG13 for the language  Also in most scenes one of the ghostbusters is smoking a cigarette  For a mature audience I definitely recommend this movie,5
199467,9번,Ghostbusters,6,A LITTLE SCARY FOR KIDS ,1
199468,9번,Ghostbusters,6,The ghosts look really good animated and so are the proton streams,1
199488,9번,Ghostbusters,8,My rating pg13 for some violence implied sex some language including 2 dks and smoking,1
199489,9번,Ghostbusters,8,This movie was just average to me  It was nothing too special just a little comedy that tries a bit too hard  But with all i can say about this movie I can definitely say that this is a classic just because of the stay puft marshmallow man  Over all just a decent movie,4
199490,9번,Ghostbusters,8,Good movie,1
199491,9번,Ghostbusters,8,This iconic movie may appear to be a scary horror movie however when you actually sit down to watch it you will realise that it is not at all scary other than a few brief appearances of ghosts  It is worth noting however that there are many hidden sexual innuendos in this movie but whether this movie is suitable for children depends upon whether they understand the sex jokes or not  All in all it is a great and hilarious classic,3
199492,9번,Ghostbusters,8,Classic comedy is alright but lacks something     ,1
199493,9번,Ghostbusters,8,I dont feel I even need to write a full review  Its a creative original fun and action packed classic  If you havent already then what are you still doing here GO see it right now,4
199494,9번,Ghostbusters,8,I LOVE Ghostbusters 1 and 2,1
199495,9번,Ghostbusters,8,This is my favorite movie but there are a few negative elements I suggest vidangeling out ghost oral sex launguege  This has great messages including teamwork and friendship,2
199496,9번,Ghostbusters,8,This film is from the 80s and like most films from that timeline it has language the s word is said at least 5 times in the film one of the characters has a dream where he gets Oral pleasure from a ghost  And Peter is a borderline sexual predator  overall great film but not for small kids,3
199497,9번,Ghostbusters,8,I liked the movie but it can be scary for younger kids It also includeslanguageLots of smokingand in some scenes lots of sex Crude humor is in Ghostbusters too,1
199652,11번,Ice Age,8,The movie was terrible for me  I think it is only suitable for under 5 year olds who dont understand it and over 8 year olds who are already older  I was very sad about some scenes  I will never forget the movie,4

199659,11번,Ice Age,8,Ice Age is one of those newer classics   My brother and I love Sid the sloth a lot  He just cracks us up We also like when Diego says Wheres the baby There he is   It was peekaboo   I still feel bad for Manny that he lost his parents to humans but this movie is SO good  I understand why it got 82 in the reviews,7

199663,11번,Ice Age,8,DO NOT let your children watch this terrible movie it truly is an abomination  The Ice Age Baby is maybe the worst thing ever and teaches a terrible messages  Parents should not even watch this they would  probably die,3
199664,11번,Ice Age,8,I enjoy this film and think the cgi holds up  Has some violence but overall an enjoyable story that the family can watch  I thought it was good but surprised how big the franchise is now,3
199665,11번,Ice Age,8,This movie is one of the best movie I seen on 2001 Its so unique and it really put the message out and what do you do for a family or your friends that you protect them from danger I think this is a really nice message to this and the movie is so awesome and the best I have seen when I was young,3
199666,11번,Ice Age,8,Its a toddler movie theres no other way to put it  But the reason for 5 stars is because its one of them special kids movies that all ages can watch  Be curious with toddlers of 2 or under though there is some scary scenes,3
199667,11번,Ice Age,8,I like this movie  It is about animals adventure,2
199668,11번,Ice Age,8,Sort of cute movie but Manny is so annoying  Its a pretty cliche movie  Manny reminds me of Calliou and it sounds like his nose is clogged up the whole time    I strongly dislike this movie but the other ones are ok  Sid is just gross he makes me naseous but    MANNY RUINS IT ALL Do not watch,6
199669,11번,Ice Age,8,okay this was one of the most boringest movies of all time its just so stupid dont watch this stupid movie I shut it off in the first 30 minutes  dont waste your money or time watching this,2
199670,11번,Ice Age,8,Title says all,1
199784,12번,Maleficent,8,Maleficent was truly magnificent though I wouldnt recomend it for 7 and under because the scenes are a bit dark and have a little violence  Other then that it was good  The only things that I think relate to sleeping beauty are the set up and cast but Maleficent is a movie in itself  Angelina Jollie and Elle Fanning did a great job as Maleficent and Princess Aurora  My absolute favorite character had to be Maleficent for her brilliant acting  I think it is a good family movie and if I had the chance to I would definitely go see it again,6
199785,12번,Maleficent,8,When Maleficent was fighting it was a bit too violent but there is a good message later on in the film,1
199786,12번,Maleficent,8,It was just a dark retelling of Sleeping Beauty  Nothing extraordinary but still good,2
199787,12번,Maleficent,8,Maleficent is a great movie based on the original fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty but from the villains point of view  The movie does have some violence and some scary scenes which could be disturbing for some children  However Maleficent is a very creative version of Sleeping Beauty that shows a totally different side of the story,3
199788,12번,Maleficent,8,I saw this movie with my family and it was better than I was expecting  Such a great movie with heartwarming scenes  Although some of the scenes SPOILER ALERT were a bit intense for some kids in my opinion like when Maleficent wakes up and realizes her wings have been cut off and cries out in distress and when Maleficent is trapped in a net which is hurting her  But these scenes are not too intense from my perspective  Another thing is when ANOTHER SPOILER rescues a crow he turns him into a naked man But NOTHING below the waist is shown so it is not that innaproprate  at all and nothing sexual is seen or done  This movie is pretty good and has great messages like not letting anger make you a horrible person and that some men are not as nice as they seem,6
199789,12번,Maleficent,8,Im ten and I LOVED this movie it is beautiful and surprising not like any other movie Ive ever seen   Very intense and includes a VERY powerful message   I would recommend 910 year olds for good reasons Maleficents anger is overpowers her and can scare younger kids as can the battle scenes but the battle scenes are not as scary as some of the reviews have said  This movie is not quite as scary as some of the reviews have said including the one that says there are decapitated people and a bloody stump which by the way you have to look SUPER close to see any of that,5
199790,12번,Maleficent,8,Okay the violence is the only thing thats not for younger kids  This movie was very good and the graphics special CGI effects were just awesome  Okay for 10,3
199791,12번,Maleficent,8,I saw this delightful movie with some friends for a birthday party and we were overwhelmed by how extraordinary this film was  It was about love but not romantic  It was funny at times but a little scary for younger kids  It was a bit violent at times but we went with my friends 7 year old sister and she loved it I was worried when she began crying but she said it was because she was happy that Maleficent didnt die  In the scary scenes she wanted to hide her eyes behind my purse but it was ok  over all it was completely amazing  Maleficent was the best movie Ive seen in years I love this film so much that I am going to watch it again,8
199792,12번,Maleficent,8,The movie has a good message is funny somewhat saddening exciting and beautiful at the same time  Angelina Jolie was amazing at her part  Great twist on a classic tale,3
199793,12번,Maleficent,8,Great movie The only bad part about it is when Maleficent gets her wings cut offno blood though just sad  The movie is worth going too  My eleven year old sister and I really enjoyed it,4
200787,18번,The Hunger Games,7,,2
200788,18번,The Hunger Games,7,I was OBSESSED with this movie It has quite a bit of violence but its not horrible  There is not that much swearing  The reason why I give 10 and up is because theres nothing horrible in this movie  If you like the series divergent you would like this movie A LOT,5
200789,18번,The Hunger Games,7,The movie tells the story of Katniss Everdeen in a competition with 24 other contestants and only 1 can live  There is not much blood but some scenes are very violent and somewhat suspenseful  Katniss is a strong role model too,3
200790,18번,The Hunger Games,7,Parents Katniss is one of the best role models I have ever seen   The movie is pretty violent though it is not afraid to show some blood  Critical This film is a thought provoking adventure about a future world which celebrates a battle to the death disguised as a reality show known only as the Hunger Games  The second hour is very intense THIS PART WAS RETARDED My only complaint is that it is too long before the titular conflict starts  Overall 4 65,5
200791,18번,The Hunger Games,7,This is REALLY violent You better read the book or see the 2nd movie You see a LOT of blood and its more for like a 11 year old or a MATURE 10 YEAR OLD if you really LOVE your  9 year old  up kids dont watch this Its VERY scary but the Second movie is good 10 up can see catching fire D D,7
200792,18번,The Hunger Games,7,I liked it when I watched it then I went to go see catching fire and now I hate this film along with Catching fire  The dumbest movies I have ever witnessed  Too violent sad and WAY too intense  But is there anything good about this movie Well I like the soundtrack and I can tell that it was very well edited and they did a great job on it  I just dont like it,6
200793,18번,The Hunger Games,7,Its a great book full of emotions and struggles  I wouldnt recommend this for younger kids since its got mature themes,2
200794,18번,The Hunger Games,7,There is a lot of violence  This is something to look into because the movie is really all about an event that is all out violence  There is some swearing and not too much but a bit of sexual content  There is also drinking  So before letting a 10yearold see this movie see what they can and cant handle,5
200795,18번,The Hunger Games,7,The movie was as good as the book and almost have the same scenes as the book  You should really watch the movie first then read the book because when i try reading the book at age 10 it was kind of hard to understand so i decided to wait for the movie to come out and see what happens  I understand way better after seeing the movie so i read the book and now i understand everything But readers i dont recommend this movie to anyone under 15 because of the violence and the gore,4
200796,18번,The Hunger Games,7,The movie is fine except at the beginning its really boring  There is some violence I dont really remember most of it but it wasnt too bad  Oh ya at one part the creepy dogs were scary  I think most kids would be ok with it if they can skip the kissing There is some kissing  I didnt have nightmares or anything from the movie  Its no worse than Iron Man and those movies  Almost the same for violence and action  I guess you just have to know if your kid would be ok with it  My mom and dad knew I would be ok,10
201375,19번,The Little Mermaid,7,Yall really need to lighten up on this movie  Ariel has cleavage but guess what Its barely any its not explicit and shes a 16 year old wearing a shell bra  She has a chest  Grow up  Shes not really a good role model given the whole you need to be pretty to get the guy thing but this is a classic Disney movie made with the classic Disney formula  Cinderella doesnt get the guy until she transforms but I dont see anyone talking bad about her  Anyway the only genuinely iffy thing is basically Ursulas character  She eats live sea creatures in  a scene keep in mind this is basically cannibalism in this world Ursula calls Ariel a tramp when she Ariel is successfully impressing Eric and Ursulas death is actually pretty dark for a Disney movie but nothing your kids probably cant handle  Theres also a scene with a shark at the beginning of the movie  Overall this movie is fine for kids and the parents on this site are honestly ridiculous,11
201376,19번,The Little Mermaid,7,This is a sexylovey doub movie involving Areil and,1
201377,19번,The Little Mermaid,7,The movie that relaunched Disney and started the Disney Renaissance a period where some of the best Disney films are considered to have been made is none other than The Little Mermaid one of the most beloved Disney films made   The story of a young but rebellious teenage mermaid who strikes a deal with an evil sea witch to   ah youll find out   Just make sure you see this one if youre a Disney fan,3
201378,19번,The Little Mermaid,7,This is such a good movie Im probably older than I should be to watch Disney princess movies but nothing will ever beat the Little Mermaid  I wasnt going to write a review but some of the ones I saw  from  overly sensitive parents are ridiculous  There is no way that I would ever want to raise my child in a world where The Little Mermaid is,4
201379,19번,The Little Mermaid,7,one of my favorite Disney movies to date  Great soundtrack some humor and great animation totally worth watching,2
201380,19번,The Little Mermaid,7,I love this movie From the songs to the loveable characters to the hopeless romantics out there  I adored this movie,3
201381,19번,The Little Mermaid,7,Teaches kids to explore the world and there is a lot out there  But there is some innuendo,2
201382,19번,The Little Mermaid,7,This is an AWESOME movie Ariel is a positive role model for everyoneeven boys  She teaches us to stand up for what we believe in  Eric is a positive role model because 1 He is not full of himself 2 During the firebirthday scene he shows that he LOVES his dog Max  He went back into the fire and he risked his life just so he could save Max,5
201383,19번,The Little Mermaid,7,this disney movie has AWFULL role models and a DISGUSTING message  The movie shows ariel disrespecting her father never listening to him and causing trouble she changes herself to be with a prince come on is that really a lesson we want kids to see  and just so you know in the original book where the little mermaid was based on for the movie ariel DIES so this movie is bad please dont show it to your kids changing your body is not a lesson we want to give them,3
201384,19번,The Little Mermaid,7,very scery ursula is very scery i didint even finish it,1
201403,19번,The Little Mermaid,4,Honestly some of you parents need to calm down  Those who say shes not wearing enough clothes really Shes a mermaid do you expect her to wear a T shirt And as for she liked Eric just for his looks 1  She saw he had a passion for music like she did and 2  When he recieved a statue of himself for his birthday he made a disgusted face showing he wasnt vain or full of himself  The music is absolutely stunning and in no way sexual like some of you freak parents are saying  One of Disneys best movies that I love even though Im almost 13,8
201404,19번,The Little Mermaid,4,This is one of the fine movies ever  Ariel is good  She reminds me of the time I was swimming during August  Ursula is the witch who has won the lottery  She has Ariels voice for good which is bad for infants  Eric is beautiful He loves Ariel  Flounder is a comedy fish who teases on Scuttle  Fine movie,9
201405,19번,The Little Mermaid,4,This film sends out a great message that if you set your mind to something you will succeed,1
201406,19번,The Little Mermaid,4,My fav movie of all time  I watch it all the time and it never gets old  Those kids who think that her outfit has to much cleavage then u should watch ballroom dancing cause that is too much cleavage not Ariels dresses  They are just normal outfits  And this movie is one of the best classics out there  I know her songs by heart and know all the lines  I say this movie should be for all ages because it has a lesson learn some risk in life are worth taken that is the real moral and that what the creators of the little mermaid was going for  Unlike mordern Disney movies The Little Mermaid touches hearts of ppl of all ages  It has that sort of spark to it please let your kids see the movie  They would love it  I know I did when I first saw it and I still love it,11
201407,19번,The Little Mermaid,4,The Little Mermaid is like a SAW cartoon,1
201408,19번,The Little Mermaid,4,I LOVE the Little Mermaid But when I was reading the reviews I noticed that some parents find that Ariels clothing choice isnt good  I mean really Do you want her to go around in a turtle neck I think you all are over protective of your kids they have to grow up sometime  You probably dont even let them watch Elmo  They probably have to watch the movie on ABCs all the time  Come on This is a great movie Ariel is a strong young woman who inspires girls to do what they believe in  Its either this or what they will find out online  Disney wouldnt make any movies too scary,12
201409,19번,The Little Mermaid,4,why does everyone thinks its inappropiate 17 and older really this movie is for 6 year olds it does not teach girls to show off their bodies shes a mermaid what else is she going to wear a Tshirt this is a good movie for little kids if your daughter watches this its not like theyll what their belly button showing and what to wear tight clothes parents are to picky about what there child watches,1
201410,19번,The Little Mermaid,4,this is a great movie for kids but my daughter always want to be like ariel lol,1
201812,790번,Despicable Me 2,6,If you ask me many cartoons they make are just mindless stupidity and the despicable me movies arent in that category  Theyre appropriate funny  kids might actually learn a thing or two if they watch this,2
201813,790번,Despicable Me 2,6,Despicable me 2 is a great movie and all but there is violence  There are guns but only jelly guns and jelly cannons  And at one point minions are stabbed with a needle transplanting a purple toxic that will turn anything into a big scary monster  One minions are transformed they are tested by throwing a car at it and the new minion swallowed it whole  A gun is fired at it but it is not harmed  But it is a good movie but it involves only ONE kiss  It also involved Gru and two minions and a big scary El Macho monster  But it is a good movie and there are ups as well as downs  Gru said once Never get older to agnes  And also it no drinking because in one scene beer is subbed with ice cream so they are probably trying to make it appropriate for kids  Despicable me is a great movie,11
201814,790번,Despicable Me 2,6,I had to take a second look at this film to see really its form of humor and its actually pretty funny and silly I liked it Its very kid friendly because kids like that kind of crap I like it too Its hilarious It way funnier than the first film It has less sappy moments even though there is one sappy moment in it you can get cheered up a little bit after that because during that scene the minions are doing silly stuff There are a couple adult jokes but they do that in most kids movies anyway and they are anything major at all They are just kind of there,9
201815,790번,Despicable Me 2,6,Stupid  Stupid humor  Stupid reactions and counter reactions from the characters  Stupid cliched plot  Stupid minions they only exist to provide a lame failed distraction from the feeble fluff that is called the substance of the film,5
201816,790번,Despicable Me 2,6,I loved it  I thought it was funny and it was totally appropriate for all ages  Despicable Me 2 is the best  I hope they come out with a 3rd one,4
201817,790번,Despicable Me 2,6,I dont see any problems expect action and humor  There is some dates and wedding but thats fine  Gru And Lucy Kiss ONCE In the movie shown  I liked the first Despicable Me better but this one was still good  I didnt really think these movies are too funny  But I still really liked it,6
201818,790번,Despicable Me 2,6,If you want a movie slightly worse than the original this is your choice  It was good and kids of any age will love it  How ever kids under five wouldnt understand the jokes,3
201819,790번,Despicable Me 2,6,A well done animated sequel that lacks the originality of the original   However it is most defiantly funnier then the first and an overall good movie that I would be fine with watching again,2
201820,790번,Despicable Me 2,6,Minions make everything funnier including this hilarious movie which I would recommend for all ages I think even adults would love this movie,2
201821,790번,Despicable Me 2,6,Good Family Film,1
201832,790번,Despicable Me 2,7,Hilarious  It didnt surpass the first which is better but it has some funny moments especially from the minions and sweet romance  One of the best animated films  One of the best 3D films ever especially the ending,4
201833,790번,Despicable Me 2,7,i was actually surprised at this sequel  i thought it was going to be bad but i laughed alot in this one and i was surprised at how much more the minions did in this one  yes in the first they were funny but they didnt do much in this one they do more which surprised me  the purple minions will scare little kids though and it did get abit predictable at times well for me anyway  so in the end this is a good funny sequel to a good funny first movie,5
201834,790번,Despicable Me 2,7,Theres some mild actionviolence,1
201835,790번,Despicable Me 2,7,More minion and romance in silly sweat sequle,1
201836,790번,Despicable Me 2,7,I think this is very family friendly  You should take your kids to see this  A must see for everyone,3
201837,790번,Despicable Me 2,7,Despicable Me 2 is a funny and family friendly film  It does feature some cartoon violence and one mild scary scene of a purple minion trying to attack little girls  Overall this film is funny and for anyone who wants to see more minions ,5
201838,790번,Despicable Me 2,7,No Problem with Language or violence one scene might be scary for kids under 5 when the minions go out in the dark and hear something but everything else it fine for kids really funny too i liked it equal to the first one kids under 5 wouldnt really understand whats happening because they dont know too many words but i loved it had to see it twiceThis Should Be the MPAA rating and the reason This Film Is Rated PG for Mild Action,5
201839,790번,Despicable Me 2,7,I rated this 4 because I think that this movie is awesome and Im a teen and I loved it and I think adults will love it is relatable and funny but some parts really young kids may not get but over all really good ,2
201840,790번,Despicable Me 2,7,Awesome really funny  I came out still laughing Better then the first one  Also  way more funny then the first,4
201841,790번,Despicable Me 2,7,its so good and more minions is funnier for little kids and very funny for adults now gru is maybe better now the bad guy is cool and theres a little violence but for small kids,1
201976,791번,Despicable Me,7,This movie is funny  My favorite part is when that werewolf howled in front of the moon  The moon vanished and the werewolf turns back into a man  The man was briefly naked but he covered up his private parts and ran away  Also theres a brief shot of Grus infant buttocks depicted in a photo album,5
201977,791번,Despicable Me,7,very GOOD,1
201978,791번,Despicable Me,7,This movie teaches kids how to really be a hero  Animation is GREAT,3
201979,791번,Despicable Me,7,the only element of concern is the one scene where the minions are printing another minions butt but even then its not graphic it only last for 23 seconds and its yellow minions for crying out loud not humans,1
201980,791번,Despicable Me,7,Despicable me is not my favorite movie but I like gru and vector,1
201981,791번,Despicable Me,7,Hahah funny  This film is brilliant  Brilliant because of the funny characters and content  Some language like stupid and looser is included in there but i think little kids and above would enjoy it  I know i certainly did D,5
201982,791번,Despicable Me,7,This is the best movie of all time  Period  The voice talents in this movie are fantastic love Steve Carrell as Gru and the overall story is fabulous  Ive watched this movie so many times and will never forget that a vector is a quantity represented by an arrow going in both directions  The movie does have more than one reference of potty humor but overall it is a good movie for kids ages 6 and up  Watch this movie You wont regret it,8
201983,791번,Despicable Me,7,This is one of the greatest movies Ive ever seen Ive never laughed so much in a theater before,2

202085,1번,Mars Attacks!,8,Some really strong violence in this film Characters are burned by lazar guns to the bone a talking human head is scene of the body with blood the president is stabbed through the back Aliens heads splatter with green goo  Some language to like St AssAhole Prick and Crap  Some sexual stuff to like scantily clad women and rumbling camper van which implies there having rough sex  Also some scenes at a casino Social drinking and cigar puffing,4

202087,1번,Mars Attacks!,8,This is a good movie with some intense scary moments and funny moments  I think kids under 8 will be hurt cause of these scenes,2
202088,1번,Mars Attacks!,8,This film is funny as hell  The Martians killing everyone may be abnoxious but Funny at the same time  Features an all star cast starring Batmans Jack Nicholson as President James Dale and also plays some person in Vegas  Other cast members include Glenn Cosse and Back To The Futures Micheal J Fox  And of course Tom Jones appears  Sadly it Bombed at the Box Office,6
202089,1번,Mars Attacks!,8,This is the movie that scifi horror comedy and Tim Burton classic that are all bunched together to make an action packed film that anyone will love  The movie has a COUPLE swear words in it   Also the martians and what they do may as well be kinda creepy this is a great alien movie that anyone would love,3
202090,1번,Mars Attacks!,8,I watched it when I was 14   I understand why my parents wouldnt let me watch it before that   It is because of the scene where the President gets stabbed   That bit is a bit gruesome and may have freaked me out when I was about 10   I loved the whole movie and has replaced Dispicable Me as my all time favourite movie,5
202091,1번,Mars Attacks!,8,Occasional cigarettes are seen  2 characters flirt on a TV show very infrequent moderate sex  Horror is too scary for under 8s  Frequent moderate violence and bloodshed e g  A alien in disguise bites someones fingers off and heads explode  At different times in the movie  A peaceful woman refers to being an alcoholic and stopping her addiction  A crucial seen is a casino in Vegas and a husband tells his wife to  play for there anversary   A man refers to aliens as S word heads  Consumerism wise again gambling occurs and the majority of people are rich  However the film is about teamwork to find a plane this is at the end and a woman is purely trying to make peace in her life,10

202178,9번,Mary Poppins,5,Mary Poppins is an instant classic I first watched this movie in March 2020 with my mom when I was sick  I loved it It took me a few tries for me to understand the plot and stuff  I even have the 50th anniversary DVD of Mary Poppins Its just as good as the sequel that came out 54 years later But I like the first movie better  Mr  Banks can be a little stern Mrs  Banks sings a song about the right for women to vote Sister Suffragette Ellen and Mrs  Brill are supporting characters  Bert is a peppy chimney sweep and the 1960s version of Jack The Lamplighter from Mary Poppins Returns  Mary Poppins is everyones favorite flying and singing British nanny thats always prim and proper and is practically perfect in every way  Anyway if you like fantasies from the 60s Id recommend this one for sure,10
202179,9번,Mary Poppins,5,when I was younger I would constantly watch this amazing movie it wonderful even though I do not watch this movie on a regular basis anymore whenever I hear someone talking about it it still brings a smile to my face every time  its definitely a must watch,3

202181,9번,Mary Poppins,5,Mary Poppins is a great Disney classic  Many people dub it as Disneys crowning achievement or Disneys ultimate classic and its not hard to see why  Ever since its release in 1964 it has enchanted generations of people  Adding to that this film may be one of the more memorable movies of all time  Fun fact I had only seen this movie once or twice beforehand about 5 or 6 years ago and so many songs and so much of the story stuck with me,5

202345,12번,Max,8,This was a really good movie Max was a great touching story There were some sad and violent parts that will make you cry but there are a lot of happy parts too some of those parts make you cry happy tears  If you do not like to cry dont watch this movie if you diced not to for that reason or any other reasons you will regret i  The adventure that this movie takes you on is truly amazing It is also a bit racist and definitly for older kids,7
202346,12번,Max,8,I am not giving 5 stars because it is sad  It has mild violence action and peril just one kiss and language like friggin one sht damn and hell  Just one part a man offers someone a beer  My rating PG mild violence action peril some language and sexuality and brief language,4
202347,12번,Max,8,For a PG movie it was pretty violent  But lets talk about the movie  I loved it  Me and my mom really dont see that many movies together because I mean we like Bourne thrillers but this movie was great  I didnt think it was bad at all  Violence was pretty heavy for a PG movie lol  There was gun fights punching kidnapping tense senses were dogs are being shot villain killed by dog RPGS firing at kids no joke and some language such as D words  But other than that it was ok for kids  This girl beside was surprised at the PG rating  But I had fun with it  Good movie ,11

203325,51번,Mirror Mirror,3,Contins some fantasy action and mild rude humor,1
203326,51번,Mirror Mirror,3,This film sends out an importanat message that judging someone by their appearence is not OK and that greed and beeing vain wont get you very far in life,1
203327,51번,Mirror Mirror,3,I love this film Its great that snow white gets to be the fighter for once Snow white is really pretty  ,4
203328,51번,Mirror Mirror,3,It wasnt very good I was definitely dissappointed  It was boring for older kids and adults yet contained lots of dirty humor that was not appropriate for younger ages  Not even worth a dollar at Redbox,3
203329,51번,Mirror Mirror,3,in one point the prince pounces on the queen and licks her facealso the dwarfs will start trying to kill each other with weapons drunk  the 5 year old i was babysitting seemed to like it  this is a very good movie at the end the prince and snow white seal there love with a kiss good for kids 5 and up probaly,3
203330,51번,Mirror Mirror,3,I think it was a little violent but Im a girl and 10 and to me it was fine  I reccomend being 9 to watch  Just because it might be hard to understand,3
203407,52번,Misery,8,I think Misery was a great movie but there is too much profanity  LANGUAGE There are several uses of St  one use of Fk and words like dirty bird from Annie  Paul writes fk in a type writer about 6 times  Paul also flips Annie the bird once   DRINKING DRUGS AND SMOKING Annie consistently drugs Paul and there is several scenes with smoking  Wine is drank in 1 scene  VIOLENCE There is a lot of violence in this film  The movie starts out with a car crash  At the end there is a pretty brutal fight scene they are hitting each other with anvil type things The movie is pretty creepy overall  Annie shows up standing up by his bed when he is sleeping  She breaks both of his ankles  Overall this movie is great and I think a mature 1112 year old can handle it,13
203408,52번,Misery,8,I watched this movie a while ago and I did find it to be a little disturbing and pretty dang unsettling but it wasnt that bad  There was some language as well like a middle finger and one spoken f word and c sucker is said once as well  The sledgehammer scene was also very disturbing and had unsettling music in the background but I say that 13 and up can see this movie and maybe a mature 12 year old,3
203409,52번,Misery,8,Sex 210,1
203410,52번,Misery,8,It was very well written a chilling movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat but be warned this movie WILL give you nightmares,1
203411,52번,Misery,8,This movie is definatly not appropriate for any children under 15 or 14  It is not as much scary as violent  Paul Sheldon as the bones in his feet broken and one of them is onscreen he screams and the ending fight is very violent  Their is also some language and 1 finger but like I said this is not for kids  Reviews on here say its okay for 10 year olds  Definatly not  As far as how good the movie itself is it is good but not as good as the book which kids shouldnt read eathir but Kathy Bates preforms her role very well and plays Annie Wilkes great,7
203412,52번,Misery,8,I watched this movie when i was 11 and i was fine but i was also watching slashers at that age,1
203413,52번,Misery,8,Brief strong violence with some swearing  Nowhere near as violent and profanity filled as most of his other movies  This is an amazing movie thats good for kids 12 and up or younger if violence doesnt disturb them and they dont repeat some of the words because this is one many Stephen King movies that isnt scary,3
203414,52번,Misery,8,This movie was fine but not my favorite  It had some language but it was pretty mild R with only a few F words  The movie does have a few scenes of violence mostly towards the end but there is one scene in the middle that is extremely tough to watch and not for the squeamish  In this scene a woman puts a wooden block in between his legs next to his ankles and breaks them with a sledge hammer and this is the most hard to watch scene  This whole movie is very intense and scary but I think a mature ten cold handle it if they dont see the ankle scene,5
203415,52번,Misery,8,I watched this movie last night and Im 9 some parts are violent but its suitable for 9 and up  The hammer scene was a bit graphic though,2
203520,59번,Moana,5,Moana is an excellent movie There are strong positive role models and even the negative ones I mean Maui become good role models and make up for their mistakes towards the end  This movie has some scares but kids ages 6 or 7 and up should be able to handle it  There is some potty language typical for kids movies but it doesnt go beyond appropriate  The music here is also wonderful  This is a great movie for kids and I recommend watching it,6
203521,59번,Moana,5,To much singing if you hate it when ur kids sing the song for ages the dont watch if not then 10 out of 10 would lemur again,1
203522,59번,Moana,5,I loved Moana  It is very beautiful and entertaining  I recommend for ages 6 and older because some scenes can be potentially frightening for younger viewers  However it is very wonderful,4
203523,59번,Moana,5,I put 4 and up because there really isnt a reason a four year old shouldnt watch this  Honestly I think even if you have a kid that is three or younger itd be fine  I just wasnt sure because there is a part with kind of like a lava fire monster lady thing  She didnt come off as too scary to me although I am 15 so I have no idea how your 2 year old would react to someone throwing fireballs and being made out of lava and rock  Other than that the movie is great Moana is such a wholesome Disney princess Shes got a great attitude and for once I love where the storyline isnt about finding a prince  Great movie and the songs are beautiful  Oh also I wouldnt show your kids this no matter their age if someone in the family just passed  In this movie Moanas grandmother dies sorry spoiler and it is sad  Moanas grandmother dies peacefully though,11
203524,59번,Moana,5,Moana is a movie about a young woman who ventures outside of her island in order to restore the heart to a goddess  It has great messages because it shows how you sometimes have to have courage to do what is right even if everybody else is doing wrong  The great role models are Moana and Maui  Moana is a couragous and brave leader who goes on a daring quest to restore peace  Maui helps Moana along her quest even though he is the one that caused everything to be destroyed in the first place  It has some violence and some creatures and monsters that could be frightening for young kids  There is a lava monster who eventually turns into the goddess as well as a giant crab and coconut pirates with weapons  There are some thunderstorms and lightening that happen while Moana is out on the ocean which could also be scary  It is worth noting that while Moana is a kidfriendly movie most of the female characters wear skirts and a bikini top and all of the males wear just skirts  The women who arent wearing skirts and bikini tops are wearing revealing dresses so you might want to consider that  Some mild language is used but nothing that would be extremely inappropraite for a tenyearold as long as they know not to repeat it  There are a few scenes where Maui tells Moana that she is going to get killed and one where he says that the entrance to the crabs palace wont appear unless he makes a human sacrafice  Moana also says inappropriate things throughout the movie some nearswearwords but no actual swear words  Moanas grandmother dies in the beginning of the movie though it is not shown onscreen  It is also shown how Moanas fathers friend drowned in the ocean when he was a young man  There is also a scene at the beginning of the movie that shows a man being forced to get a painful tattoo  Another thing is that all of the adult characters have tattoos and I wasnt a huge fan of how it promoted tattoos especially in that first scene  Maui also goes to the bathroom in the water and leaves Moana to feel the water afterwards and that part was very gross  If there wasnt as much violence or innappropriate content I would reccommend this movie for ages six and up  No consumerism or innappropriate substances are present  Overall Moana is a great animated movie and is one of my favorite animated movies of all time  but I would highly reccommend it for ages ten and older only  It was marketed as a kidfriendly movie but I see it as a movie more for tweens and older kids,22
203525,59번,Moana,5,Good  Some funny parts like the dart put in Mauis pottyprivate part  And positive models  You have to see this  You might even give it 5 stars Really good movie  Id probably rate it 5,7
203526,59번,Moana,5,Well it is good but I saw a bit of disqusting things but it was only one,1
203527,59번,Moana,5,He was heralded as the first and only WWE member and it turned out he was actually a Hawaiian demigod  His name was Maui and he got his powers from a magic hook  He gave humans many gifts and decided to steal life magic from the island lady  It turns out that was a bad idea and he was attacked by the lava guy  Oops  But then he meets Moan who is a princess from a village and shes like give the life thing back to the island lady  So Mauis like No but then hes like ok so its gucci  But Maui doesnt have the life thingy so they have to get it from a shiny crab man named Tomato  They almost die but then Moan gets the life thingy  Oh yeah theres also an immortal chicken  Then they  go to fight the lava guy but Mauis hook gets broke  Then Maui is like Im sad  Moan is like I am Moan  Then she goes to fight the lava guy again  Oh and the ocean is sentient so anyway she goes to fight the lava guy again  Maui comes back and helps DONT READ AHEAD IF U DONT WANT SPOILERS Then ooo plot twist the lava guy is the island girl but without the life thingy  The the island girl gives maui a new hook cuz he broke his  Moans village gets saved and they become seatravelers again  The end  Or is it  Moan 2 coming to theaters in 1995,22
203528,59번,Moana,5,I liked this film because of the courage this film shows  The music was good in the film and it is very entertaining but the movie is kind of violent so I think it is ok for People 8 and up,2
203529,59번,Moana,5,Moana is great   I liked the singing   There are some parts that are scary  Its a funny movie because of Hehe and Pua theyre so great,4
203588,59번,Moana,8,Took the 3yo goddaughter to see this today at PimmiPlayHouse a place that plays movies that have already left the theater  She was alarmed by the sea crab and asked to leave  I had already seen the movie and obliged to leave because she was crying   I think she was just too young for it  Maybe in a couple of years well try this movie again,5
203589,59번,Moana,8,Moana is really good for any children wanting an adventurous movie with a female main character  There are lots of great songs and I really think Moana and Maui are good role models for little children  They dont give up or at least they come back to face the problem  It was a little scary foy my younger brother but otherwise it is great in every way,4
203590,59번,Moana,8,I thought that it was very predictable but over all it was pretty sweet,1
203591,59번,Moana,8,the movie is ok but on here you cant watch it,1
203592,59번,Moana,8,Moana is an awesome movie Moana Maui and other characters show role models that other people should follow  Also children can get a feel for ancient Polynesian culture  Other than that the movie is curious thrilling and just hilarious,4
203593,59번,Moana,8,your kids will drown in boredom  Oh ya ps the star actor is World Wrestling Championthe rock,2
203594,59번,Moana,8,This is a Disney movie that is filled with bravery   A young girl named Moana sets off on a boat to save her island    She meets a demigod named Maui and they journey and they meet a craband a huge lava monster   They are fun catchy songs that are appropriate for kids   The language is not bad at all but they are some violent scenes Hope this review was good,5
203595,59번,Moana,8,so good great for families,2
203596,59번,Moana,8,Great animation film about a heroic girl who seeks for adventure  Its perfect for kids and families  has great music and good visual  Has some scary moments but nothing too intense   Its one of the best animation films of the year and its nominated for two Oscars,4

204580,95번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,I was traumatized when I first saw it and it still creeps me out for some reason,1
204581,95번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,Its a very funny movie that does not need to be rated PG13  I watched it when I was 10 and my sister who is 9 saw it at 8  It has a good message and good acting  There are some swear words and a few mildly inappropriate references but its not that bad and it will easily go over younger peoples head  Its very funny and I recommender for families,5
204582,95번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,This is a great movie for everyone to watch whether or not they have gone through a divorce because it is absolutely hilarious and lets the kids know that even if the parents dont love each other anymore they still love them  I say 10 for language some sexual jokes and brief arguingyelling,2
204583,95번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,This film is really good Im being honest its my 3rd favorite movie behind Schindlers List and Jurassic Park  But just like with those other two films Mrs  Doubtfire is one of the greatest films of 1993 and it does a good job on setting you up in an emotional place  For example there are some times throughout the film where you are probably laughing so hard where you cant breath or some times where you cry feeling emotional due to how the characters feel  Because the plot of the story is emotional which shows a couple being divorced and the dad disguises himself thanks to his brother and its actually a good idea for a comedydrama film  However I can not let this movie go without adding some critique to it OK so lets start with the fact that there is a few sexual references throughout the movie but thats why its got the PG13 rating and a majority of them will probably go over kids heads  Also for a Robin Williams comedy there is a lot of language the website says that there was an F word in the film but I watched the movie twice and I did not hear any F bombs in it  This is a very good movie its understandable of making 2nd place at the box office during the time it was released and this is a good movie for 11 but anyone under than that should definitely have a parent or guardian with them,7
204584,95번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,This movie is hilarious  I couldnt stop laughing  The father of 3 kids dresses up as a nanny to be with his kids  He faces many obstacles that are very funny to watch  A Great  family pick for some good laughs,5
204585,95번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,Every kid of every age will find this movie funny though kids of 11 will probably get the jokes  it is a delightful look at what happens when a divorced father pretends to be a prim English nurse  Some inexplicably vulgar sexual content when he overtly quizzes the mother on her sex life and warns Stu Pierce Brosnan about some of her sex life  Occasional sex jokes but mostly a family movie  Robin Williams is cute and very good at imitations Harvey Fierstein is consistently entertaining and Sally Field provides a relieving gravitas  Definitely recommended,6
204586,95번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,Great movie for families very very very funny  I highly recommend it,2
204587,95번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,I remember when i first watched this movie didnt really understand it but i watched it again a few years later and loved it,1

204712,99번,Mulan,6,My favourite film of all time been watching it since I was 5 years old,1
204713,99번,Mulan,6,This movie is wayyyyyy better then the remake watch this one instead,1
204714,99번,Mulan,6,Honestly this movie is just amazing all around  Great messages for kids great characters actual drama and emotion and great music  It does get a bit dark at points but doesnt have anything too graphic,3
204715,99번,Mulan,6,The only thing I would object to in this film is the nudity when Mulan is bathing but the men come there too  Otherwise a great film with great role models,2
204716,99번,Mulan,6,Mulan is one of my favorite movies  It shows a strong independent woman who helps fight for her country  I think its great for 5 because it has a happy ending and I personally dont think the fight scenes are very intense  AWESOME MOVIE GO WATCH IT,5
204717,99번,Mulan,6,Its a great Disney movie but its story is misleading as like Pocahontas before it it suffers from being very inaccurate  But I dont blame Disney for sugar coating this movie as the real Mulan committed suicide after her service because she was going to be made a concubine  I will say that other than being watered down into a fantasy adventure film is really good and there is comic relief  Thats a story about Asian people  Mulan is a one of the great role models for children and she is worth for fighting for  She doesnt want her father to go to war like a military and she becomes strong  She takes her fathers place  Also a 16 year old girl like other Disney Princesses such as Aurora Moana Ariel and Merida  Mulan is the first place most good Disney Princess  Though it has war violence like theres too many Hun army to destroy Shangs in the mountains  We have 2000 Huns 4000 of them in real life  I dont know why there is so many Hun soldiers who want to take over China  There is a village called Tung Shao Pass that was destroyed by the Huns  There is high body count you can see dead soldiers and horses especially the poor little girl who lost her Lilo doll  A main antagonist ShanYu invades Chinese castle and he passed away in the fireworks bomb  ShanYu is one of the underrated Disney Villains but Mulans a Disney masterpiece  Some people are not allowed to coloring their scleras because its really painful for your eyes  ShanYu has black ink on his eyes that makes him scary and looks like hes having a night vision  I forgot that he has sith eyes  I have sensitive eyes but I couldnt stop thinking about him when I was 9 and I wish I had to change my eye color with powers  Im so obsessed with Mulan at the age of 9 and I really want to try to watch it  Okay also worth noting that theres some sexual jokes in the movie and a very akward skinny dippingbathing scene in which you see Yao standing up on a rock in front of Mulan  The viewer doesnt see anything but its implied that Mulan did as she tells Mushu that she never wants to see a naked guy ever again at which point a bunch of nude men run past  Has plenty of jokes that might go over the kids heads but will keep grown ups laughing  Even LiShangs back is shown and Mulan gets stunned  LiShang looks so hot though  Lets get down to business to defeat the Huns is going to be acronym for LGBT and some theorists think that Shang is gay or Bisexual  It has funny scenes like the Matchmakers butt becomes fire fart Mushu is being Batman and some scenes are funny  I have an only problem that Mulan is having a big ears and thats too funny for the Disney Princess films  There is also ShanYu is thicc I bet that he may be thicc as Thanos you Mulan fans may find it funny  I couldnt stop laughing Some fans may complain that ShanYu being attractive I dont think so So anyways The Animation is great and stunning great characters and amazing plot  Thats a historical inaccurate but the Disney movie made the original legend even better I recommend for ages 5 or 6  Great job Disney Though I will be 15 to see a release date of live action Mulan it has different characters different plot and it will release Aug 21 2020  Maybe fans of animated Mulan will might be disappointed,40

204814,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,Really Good  Not Much to Say  No Content  Does have positve messages and role models though,4
204815,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,Its such a good Muppet movie as they all are  One of the best,2
204816,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,This sequel is certainly more intense and has a lot more action and suggestive moments then the first  Kids should be older and it will not appeal to crowds older then 13,2
204817,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,For longtime Muppet fans this movie will entertain and excite  For younger children they may be frightened by some scenes but the action is more entertaining than straightup horrorstyle,2
204818,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,It is super good but there are some loud scenes where they are breaking in  and it is a really good movie,1
204819,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,I watched this when it came out a long time ago and it was SUPER scary  I think I can handle it now though ,2
204820,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,This is the worst movie I have seen in ages  Way to scary for muppet loving kids  The person who came up with the idea of this Horror yes I said it  Horror  movie is nuts  Mad,6
204821,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,This is what you get if you mixed who framed roger rabbit with the great muppet caper  Oh its too dark did you read the plot before seeing this movie  My then 3 year old cousin now 5 saw this with me on opening day and she actually enjoyed it  This movie delivers a message about honesty Kermit tries to tell the truth that hes not Constantine,4
204822,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,My ratingPG for violence,1
204823,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Mild violence,1
204824,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,This Muppet sequel doesnt reach its high standards as the 2011 film but it is great just the way it is  This movie brings a lot of heart and gags that I am sure are capable of entertaining people of all ages  This movie is good for all ages even little ones,3
204825,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Hilarious Perfect for all kids but some may not understand all the jokes  The reason I didnt give it a higher rating was because I almost fell asleep during the film,3
204826,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,i wanted to see this movie when it came out  i liked the first one a little better,2
204827,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,While not without its flaws this muppet film is a great one with a nice caper plot and some great writting  Though some of the characters are off with Fozzie being dumb the gang not recognizing the difference between a frog and their friend of four decades and a in your face moral followindg the climax it still manages to hold up with some great songs a really good plot and the pairing of Sam the Eagle and Ty Burrell is one of the films strong points  For kids there are some violent scenes including explosions and bombs that might scare them and not much else that would be inappropriate for kids  Overal great film and an improvement on its more human focused predecessor,4
204828,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,My mother took me and my two younger brothers 10 and 8 despite my refusals  The advertisements seemed to bore me and really didnt grab my attention  It wasnt worth the eight dollars per ticket  I understood the humor but I still didnt like the movie  Maybe it is just me but talking muppets really dont grab the attention of an adolescent,5
204829,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,This movie is not as great as the first and money wasting,1
204830,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Not as good as The Muppets which I really adore but still worth watching  It has some funny scenes  The cameo appearances was a surprise  Ricky Gervais was good Tina Fey was funny but for me Ty Burrell stole the show with Sam The Eagle  They were hilarious  At least the songs were catchy,6
204831,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Truly I thought it was good   It has a lesson in it dont judge a book by its cover because Kermit was taken to jail because he looked like the bad frog in the movie also there were great messages in the movie but only a few bad words like butt stupid ect   So truly in think you and your family should watch this movie together   Its great for family movie night,4
204832,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Do you like unpredictable movies Do you like movie that makes  you jump If so you would  love the muppets most wanted  I rate it 4 stars it is good for 6 year olds and up There is some parts in the movie that makes you jump If you are looking for a quiet movie this is not right movie to go to  There is lot of famous characters like for  example Ross Lynch from Austin and Ally and a ton more that you might know   It is a pg movie once again I rate it 4 stars out of 5 star,8
205013,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,I LOVED this movie when I was little and I still do  Its great for young and sensitive kids because the violence is minimal and most of the story revolves around the Totoro and his friends,2
205014,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This is an adorable movie that me and my younger sister loved Totoro is super nice he tries to cheer up the girls when their mom doesnt come home from the hospital and he stands with them in the rain while the girls wait for their dad to come home  Satski goes looking everywhere for her sister showing positive roll models and good messages  There are some little ghost things called soot sprites which maybe be sort of creepy for kids under the age of 3  But otherwise I loved it Didnt know Dakota Fanning was in it either,7
205015,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Despite the popularity of the movie I didnt find it very good  The plot wasnt super interesting but I find its more for younger viewers,2

205019,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is a Japanese film for kids and doesnt contain anything bad,1
205020,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,I and all my family LOVE this movie It is great I think its awesome because it has a great positive message and it shows two girls that are sisters that moved to a different place and only with their dad because Their mom is in the hospital  It doesnt show anything scary about the mom being in the hospital because shes just a little sick  Though I do think parents should know is that theres one part where the older sister is afraid her mom will get really sick and something will happen to her and shell die but its appropriate and not scary at all even for little kids,5
205021,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,I feel that this movie is a whimsical introduction to Studio Ghibli along with Kikis Delivery Service and The Cat Returns  It tells a heartwarming story and the main characters are beyond relatable to a pair of siblings  However there is the plot point of Satsuki and Meis mother Yasuko  In the movie Yasuko has tuberculosis and when her condition becomes more critical Mei runs away from home  Some say this scene is a gives the movie a deceptive twist that scared their children and ruined the movie  You know what else is deceptive Tuberculosis terminal illness  You need to explain what is going on if your child asks and ask them if they understand  If you keep this information from them theyll learn further in the future and it would be much more traumatic  You shouldnt lie to your kids because if they wholly believe your lies youll come off as untrustworthy to your kids and it would mess them up further later  So teach your kid whats going on if they need to know  Itll work better eventually  Knowledge is power,13

205060,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Well Spirited Away it looks like youre finally off the hook I have now seen seven Hayao Miyazaki movies with widely varying degrees of enjoyment  Princess Mononoke and Porco Rosso are legitimately fantastic films animation or otherwise  Castle in the Sky is a largely enjoyable movie bogged down with a weak 3rd act and a bloated runtime  Nausica of the Valley of the Wind and Howls Moving Castle both had interesting parts but were ultimately too scattershot and tedious to be fully enjoyable  And Spirited Away was easily the most overrated and unsatisfying of the whole bunch     until I saw My Neighbor Totoro,6
205061,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This used to be my favroute movie when I was little now I still love it many of the characters are kind and warmhearted,1
205062,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This film is most defiantly one of Miyazakis best productions  A great famliy movie experience  Good for all audiences  Spectacular artwork  A beautiful film   Mostly recommended for younger kids  A must for Young anime fans,7
205063,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,I absolutely love this movie  Its a cute story with a deep meaning behind it  Once I figured out the meaning it kind of freaked me out  Still it was an amazing movie with imaginative characters and beautiful animation  Spoiler It had me thinking that the mother was about to die and I was close to crying through it thinking of what would happen if she died in the movie  It was so sad how Mei was  bringing the corn all the way just to give it to her mother  Overall its a really good movie and you should see it,7
205064,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This Movie is The 5th Miyazaki Film I Have Watched Out of 9 It Was Such a Cute Movie With an Amazing Story and Plot  With Breathtaking Animation I Think My Neighbor Totoro should be in the Top 5 Best Movies Ever Made,2

205112,114번,My Octopus Teacher,8,Beautiful docu  Thats all I can say,2
205113,114번,My Octopus Teacher,8,Gorgeous film Really inspirational  I usually dont like documentaries Except for the Taylor Swift one of course but this one is amazing,3
205114,114번,My Octopus Teacher,8,This is an emotional entertaining documentary about a man going through depression who visits an octopus every day and eventually befriends it  Some kids wont find it interesting enough to keep watching but older kids will likely be drawn in  Theres almost nothing wrong with this movie except the depression aspect might confuse some younger kids  Watch it,4
205115,114번,My Octopus Teacher,8,i think the movie comes out special but for someone the movie can be boaring it got one sad part but the rest is him telling about the octopus he have seen  the movie is special and i do recommend it  wow    i learned alot,3
205116,114번,My Octopus Teacher,8,I loved this movie It was fun and more of a documentary but overall really good  My whole family loved it and its usually very hard for us to figure out what to watch,3
205117,114번,My Octopus Teacher,8,My octopus teacher  What a life  I mean you always hear Long live the king  But have you heard Long live the octopus Have you Ok I didnt mean to threaten you  Oh yes I did im sorry not really   Im actually very nice you know    can I break your Ps4 Sooo    I regard this movie more like a documentary  It is pretty tear jerking at most times  It looks like a 1 hour long ad but like one of the BEST ads ever you know  If your going watch this your going to want to become an  scuba diver  For real  Enjoy  Its sad  And sad  And sadder  Enjoy again  No really  What are you reading  I said go  Enjoy  Oh wait  I need to,24
205118,114번,My Octopus Teacher,8,Great movie  For kids interested in underwater life about forests under the water learning about octopuses and how they live their life under the sea  This movie also shows about how octopuses protect themselves from enemies and has zero violence except for one sad part in the movie With sharks But aside from that the movie is really fun and really interesting and will not give any kids nightmares,3
205119,114번,My Octopus Teacher,8,Heartfelt though you have to be pretty rich to literally do nothing but visit an octopus for a year and a half  He has a nice house on the beach front etc  Very good docco for kids,3
205120,114번,My Octopus Teacher,8,My Octopus Teacher is a really coolamazing movie but it gets really scarysad at the end my favorite part is where the octopus got on him   My mom cried  But instead of crying I was laughing inside myself while she was crying  But overall it is a pretty good movie  It was really sweet but also stressful especially at the end like when there was a shark chasing the octopus   But watch it if you can,6
205130,115번,My Spy,7,Theres a lot of violence just heads up theres kicking punching stabbing exploding killing throwing fire heads getting chopped off  Violence 1010 language 810 theres ss btch st dk gruesome things 610 a little gross from vomiting and blood and some mean and good messages but thats all,2
205131,115번,My Spy,7,I loved the movie a lot Even though there were swearing  in the movie it didnt bother me  My parents let me watch this movie With them  Still its the best spy movie Ive ever seen  So Id say give the movie a shot There is violence though like punching and kicking and pushing a truck down a big clif,6
205132,115번,My Spy,7,It was great  A couple iffy things though including how JJ threatens to kill a nine year old and said nine year old is manipulative and curses plus the overall language and violence gosh I make it sound bad but I really liked it   I feel though that if they toned it down a notch it could have been PG but oh well,3
205133,115번,My Spy,7,Parents are overreacting about this movie  This is a spy movie and any movie that involves the government and spies and a big burly man in a serious way is not an ok way to spent your kids time  If a parent watches the trailer checks the common sense review and still thinks Oh a man gets decapitated and a kid calls an adult a dk Well Im going to 100 show that to my 9yearold Then thats just bad parenting  I get it if some parents didnt check how old you need to be to watch this movie but if you actually took the time afterward to write a review on this site and KNEW ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND then dont blame the movie for being aimed at tweens blame yourself for not reading about this movie before you show it to your kids  Again Im not blaming parents who didnt get a good opinion but really man be more careful  Im not gonna do an I hope this review helped Thing I normally do because I am writing this review at 1030 at night and I am very tired  So goodnight commonsense See ya tomorrow,9
205134,115번,My Spy,7,This was a really fun movie  Based on the ratings I was a little worried but it was pretty good  The language wasnt the best but most mature children will be able to handle it  There is a gay couple so make sure that your kids understand that  Overall good movie,5
205135,115번,My Spy,7,It has violence but not that that much I watched it with a friend and her younger brother it has some language but its pretty appropriate if you dont like violence dont watch it,1
205136,115번,My Spy,7,This Movie is honestly a great one I loved seeing a big guy like Drax teaming up with a Little girl  They have shanking stabbing shooting punching and other violence but if your 1011 that wont bother you too much  There is too much swearing for a movie supposedly for 10 year olds  There is uses of Bith Sht Jesus and more but if you watch Action movies it wont be such a big deal If your 10 in my opinion it would be fine,4
205137,115번,My Spy,7,A lot of bad language and a lot of bad fist fights that might scare your younger kids  Also some kissy stuff and flirting and gross stuff like that  Overall there are some good messages like team work and family  There are some scary weapons plus a main character throws a knife at another character and barfs on accident  Although the action might be scary it is actually super sick  Very funny Great movie,7
205447,127번,Need for Speed,8,Not bad but pretty predictable and kinda corny at times  Aaron Pauls performance is great but overall its not the best action film out there,2
205448,127번,Need for Speed,8,Aaron Paul is brilliant in this it was good seeing him not cooking meth with a 50 year old man lmao the movie is a fun pretty good movie I like how there is no CGI used which is great And what CSM forgot to put under positive messages is SPOILERS the bad guy manslaughters his friend and leaves him there and at the end a similar situation happens at the end with the bad guy in the car and Toby Aaron Paul takes him out of the car to make sure hes alright,3
205449,127번,Need for Speed,8,Need for Speed the movie has to be one of the better gamebased movies out there  It has charming characters intense but mostly grounded action and some pretty great moments,2
205450,127번,Need for Speed,8,This movie is fine for younger teens,1
205451,127번,Need for Speed,8,It was a really good movie  Very good story the racing was amazing,2
205452,127번,Need for Speed,8,Good car movie,1
205453,127번,Need for Speed,8,I think this movie is recommended for a 12 but the nudity is not bad just a butt shown only,1
205454,127번,Need for Speed,8,My ratingPG13 for intense sequences of crashes and actionsome languageracy contentand brief nudity,1
205464,128번,Never Been Kissed,8,This movie was fantastic I loved the plot it was invigorating and engaging  Movie does include a scene that takes place in a sexed classroom diagrams are present as well as the classic bananacondom learning activity  I recommend this movie to kids 13 and older due to that one scene as well as a few sexual comments throughout the movie  Any kids younger should either watch with a parent or not watch at all but the movie has got great lessons and can teach kids some good values  There is also some mild drug taking pot brownie but its nothing serious shouldnt be a problem  Also do be aware that there is some flirtation between a teacher and an undercover student the student is actually 25 but pretending to be 17  Id make sure your child is aware that studentteacher relationships are definitely not okay because while this is a great movie its from the 90s so its a bit more lack on that kind of thing than we are today  Overall Id definitely recommend it just know your child and be ready to explain whats okay and whats not,9
205465,128번,Never Been Kissed,8,Overall this movie didnt wow me  I definitely didnt hate it but it didnt really pack the punch i was hoping for  One of the most problematic themes is the flirting between the teacher and a perceived student  Although the student is actually an adult my mom and I were still very concerned by this,4
205466,128번,Never Been Kissed,8,This movie was very entertaining but it has a lot of sex references  Definitely 13 or 12 with a parent,2
205467,128번,Never Been Kissed,8,It a good movie but  there is some drinking  and sx in the movie  I think kids who are under 13 years old should watch it with a parent,3
205468,128번,Never Been Kissed,8,This movie has a great lesson and theme and is very good  The only thing some parents might have to worry about is a few uses of drugs and two people making out,2
205469,128번,Never Been Kissed,8,The main character goes undercover as a high school student and she and a teacher clearly both are attracted to each other even though he believes shes a student  When she announces that she is actually an adult the teacher seems really conflicted and upset  But he was fine with it when he thought she was a minor Gross,4
205470,128번,Never Been Kissed,8,I have to say this is one of my all time favorite rom coms  Some scenes could be a lil iffy for younger viewers like when they put condoms on bananas etc  Language is mild   couple of shts once in a while  Also Micheal Varton is effing hot ,5
205471,128번,Never Been Kissed,8,this movie was both funnyboringinappropriate and just your normal romcom     I liked it and agree that it is a must see but    i dunno     if you are looking for a really great romcom watch Love actually soooooo much better It wasnt as inappropriate as I thought it would be unlike four weddings and a funeral but it is still a bit racy   Id say watch it before you let your kids see it then decide what you think,3
205472,128번,Never Been Kissed,8,My ratingR for mature racy content throughoutgraphic nuditydrug useand language,1
205490,130번,Night at the Museum,7,Nobody,1
205491,130번,Night at the Museum,7,Its a funny film with a few stereotypes about  Sacajawea and Attila the Hun also some mild peril and Larry is chased by Attila the Hun with swords two little guys crash a car into a rock and they presumably died  Also some language like kick ass hell and dum dum,2
205492,130번,Night at the Museum,7,Pros Yay Im glad I watched this movie Now I know more about history the only 2 things I dont like are,4
205493,130번,Night at the Museum,7,This is a really good movie  It has an awesome plot and was surprisingly based off of a childrens picture book that had less then twenty pages,2
205494,130번,Night at the Museum,7,This movie has lots of adventure And a lot of comedy It  might be a little scary for little kids though,2
205495,130번,Night at the Museum,7,This movie was great It was actionpacked and funny and taught you a few facts throughout history in a fun way  Definitely a mustwatch,3
205496,130번,Night at the Museum,7,Seriously CSM Three stars This movie is so underrated  My entire family loves it  It has great characters a great plot and that twist at the end is amazing  SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT,6
205497,130번,Night at the Museum,7,Mild infrequent swearing  A few subtextual references that would go over most kids heads  Some scenes including a scene where a wax figurine is run over and another where a mummy is unwrapped may be frightening to younger viewers,3
205498,130번,Night at the Museum,7,this movie seems a bit scary at first for little ones but it all comes together as a really fun and hilarious movie   It is fun for all ages 7 and up,2
205499,130번,Night at the Museum,7,Night at the Museum is not the best film but fun and good for kids  Warning the Civil war guys have masks on and may be a little creepy  This film is great but not for under seven  The old men disguise as goodies so can be quite scary,4
205853,157번,Oliver & Company,8,I grew up watching this movie  I have lived in a very diverse area all of my life and this movie was always something  I could relate to   As a child I would get done with dinner and beg on my hands and knees to watch this movie   It got to the point that the movie just had to stay in the DVD player  I have seen a lot of bad reviews about this movie  I am wracking my brain as to why  It could be the scary themes represented but I cannot understand why it is such a big deal  A lot of movies have scary themes throughout  I also grew up loving Pocahontas and that is a terribly rated movie  If we allowed are children to watch movies with REAL LIFE SCENARIOS maybe our kids wouldnt be asshole or serial killers  Thank you very much,11
205854,157번,Oliver & Company,8,Oliver and company was phenomenal     one of my favorite Disney movies of all time tied with the great mouse detective there are some kinda extreme scenes for little kids  one where desoto one of the evil Rottweilersgets hurt another where dodger main character puppy gets beaten up in a dog fight    and the adult human is told hes going to die if he doesnt pay his debts,1
205855,157번,Oliver & Company,8,Love the music Oliver and Rita and dodger are my favorites Jenny is great to so is Winston and gorgette is kinda annoying bill sykes AWESOME,2
205856,157번,Oliver & Company,8,I have LOVED this movie since I was pretty little  The plot is a little bit unoriginal and there are some bad role models Georgette is a conniving jealous diva  Fagan kidnaps a girls cherished pet kitten to pay off a debt  Dodger is kind of rude and uncaring at times but changes later  The villain in addition to being a total jerk smokes constantly But just so long as kids know not to mimic that behavior theyll be good  I think the main reason I love this movie so much is the music especially Why Should I Worry and Perfect isnt easy,6
205857,157번,Oliver & Company,8,This movie has emotional elements including a kitten who is alone in the earlier scenes and some scary sequences including two meanacing dogs and an intenseviolent death of a certain character  There is even some mild consumerism including an image of the CocaCola logo some insults suggestive content messages and brief smoking  So its on for ages 9 iffy for ages 8 and off for ages 5,3
205858,157번,Oliver & Company,8,Oliver and Company is an amazing movie Its so underrated everyone forgets about it but its really good  Its funny and it has good songs obviously because Billy Joel is in it it paved the way for the Disney Renaissance  which in my opinion are better than the classics Oliver and Company is not to be pushed aside,3
205859,157번,Oliver & Company,8,Ive loved Disney films since I was born  No really  I was born in 93 and the first film I saw in a theater was The Lion King  I think of all the films I saw in the theater during the first few years of my life The Lion King and Oliver and Company hold the most special place in my heart  Ive seen TLK and other Disney classics many times over but Ive only recently rediscovered Oliver  The status of the film is a bit like its central character  this was originally a very popular film back when it was released in 1988 and even got a rerelease in 1996 where I was first exposed to its greatness but it took 7 years for it to get on home video had mostly mixedtonegative reviews and went from popular to criminally overlooked  In the 80s the dark period of Disney history Oliver and Company was the light at the end of the tunnel and it helped pave the way for the best films to come out of Disney since the Golden Age period that began with Snow White 1937 and ended with The Rescuers 1977  The Little Mermaid Beauty and the Beast Aladdin The Lion King and other films of the Disney Renaissance period the 90s were all created by the artists who started with Oliver and Company  But it doesnt give off the impression of being an experimental film it ends up being a true classic  Oliver is an orphaned kitten living on the streets of New York City  He fights to survive until he meets Dodger a dog voiced by the alwayscool Billy Joel who is initially resistant to Oliver but ends up liking him quite a bit  So much in fact that he introduces the kitten to his group of ragtag stray dogs including the dumb Einstein the smart Brit Francis the sassy Rita and the hilarious Tito  All of them help out a homeless man named Fagin who owns a large debt to a loan shark named Sykes one of the scariest villains in Disneys history  He owns two intimidating Dobermans and theyre both hostile towards Fagins gang  Then when Oliver learns how to survive hes adopted by a little rich girl named Jenny whose poodle Georgette is anything but pleased about  It all ends up becoming a tale of friendship and loyalty thats on par with anything Disney did during the Disney Renaissance  But the tone of this one is very gritty and realistic at points  a shock for Disney but still counterbalanced with happy songs and what not  For example the opening few minutes will make even the most hardhearted cry at least a little when Oliver is simply left alone in a dark and scary New York at night  But the song playing during this scene Huey Lewis Once Upon a Time in New York City is sad yet uplifting pointing towards better things that are yet to come  And that they do  The only other things to worry about are some mildly scary scenes when Jenny gets kidnapped by Sykes when the characters are threatened by Sykes Dobermans and the intense chase scene in the New York subway  Overall though CSM is wrong theyve got the same biased opinion on this as the film critics who havent appreciated it for what it is one of Disneys best classics  The music is awesome the animation is awesome the humor is awesome the voice acting is awesome   so yeah  In only a little bit over an hour Disney accomplishes more than most films of three hours can Just see this one You wont regret it,26
205860,157번,Oliver & Company,8,If you dont know when you see Bill Sykes evil smirk with  sitting on the chair and holding his cigar that expression that looks like Shan Yu says how many men does it to deliver a message That is all I can say However Oliver And The War is the best crossover movie ever created  But I recommended for ages 18 and up because of lot of violence and Elmo is very thicc,3
205861,157번,Oliver & Company,8,I like this movie  Its old cute got catchy music and has an interesting storyline  Alright so the interactions between two dogs was fine to a point then one wanted to talk to the other alone and he it took as    something else  The two dobbermans can seem intimidating  In conclusion a fun movie but children may need to be accompanied if they are sensitive,5
205862,157번,Oliver & Company,8,The movie is awesome and I loved the songs streets of gold,1
205911,167번,One Crazy Cruise,8,With only some mild teen kissing and flirting to worry about kids are perfectly fine to watch One Crazy Cruise  Expect a silly story along with messages about embracing change and coming together as a family,2
205912,167번,One Crazy Cruise,8,This Movie is amazing Cody Simpson in this movie dating Ellie that  was how I thought it would end with a romantic ending LiarLiar Vampire was really badso after I watched it I binge watched One Crazy Cruise I saw Good Ratings on it on Imdb I wish it was on DVD So I could watch as many times I want  Nick Good Job,3
205913,167번,One Crazy Cruise,8,It is a very nice movie one of my favorites,1
205914,167번,One Crazy Cruise,8,My ratingPG for rude humor throughout,1
205993,171번,Onward,6,This movie is about magic and how theres always a little magic inside you  I saw the movie on the TV and it was great  Its about 2 boys going on an adventure to try to bring their dad back in 24 hours  Theyll introduce more characters and events  There are hard obstacles they have to overcome great backup and heartful messages and not too much violence  There is some but not much  Overall this movie is great  DisneyPixar collaborations are great,8
205994,171번,Onward,6,A really sweet story with just the right amount of adventure,1
205995,171번,Onward,6,it was well done funny and had no language or sex  mild action  a iffy comment about a female officers girlfriend  an awesome familyfriendly flick,4
205996,171번,Onward,6,Onward is the best movie of 2020 so far  Though the story is a bit lackluster generic rescue story they managed to make it work somehow  I almost cried 3 times which 1 time it succeeded  One time was when Ian was listening to his dad using the cassette boombox the time where I actually did cry was when Ian was sitting with dads halfbody realizing that Barley was just like a father figure to him and the last time when Barley hugged Ian at the end,4
205997,171번,Onward,6,Its a good movie and I recommend it,1
205998,171번,Onward,6,A lighthearted fantasy story with wonderful characters and powerful messages about family and selflessness  There is some combat but its not gory at all  I would recommend this to everyone,3
205999,171번,Onward,6,I enjoyed Onward like I enjoyed many other Pixar films  Onward follows two boys who go on a journey to bring back their dad for a day  The stakes are high and the movie is interesting,3
206000,171번,Onward,6,Its a mustwatch amazing movie that really surprised me  Its very heartwarming and I recommend it,2
206064,172번,Open Season,8,Natureset animated comedy with scenes that spoof,1
206065,172번,Open Season,8,Id recommend it  Its not every day you see computergenerated characters trampling computergenerated grass as they walk through it,2
206066,172번,Open Season,8,Good but crude some positive messages,1
206067,172번,Open Season,8,Unlike Tarzan 2 This film is not appropiate for ages 26 at all there is lots of profanity like Get off my tree you Fing squirrel and there is the word ass in the film but its hard to see Overall This film is not appropiate for ages 26 at all due to all of the bad language,1
206068,172번,Open Season,8,This movie is watchable  But it has its bits of badnessbut overallthis movie is worth watching,2
206069,172번,Open Season,8,This movie has everything the word CP fart jokes peeing jokes poop jokes horrible voice acting animation story characters everything  Pretty much this movie sucked  The only interesting part was the psychotic huntsman who has a gun and likes to go PEW PEW and tries to kill our notsobeloved heroes  For once I was on the antaganists side  This is an awful example to younger viewers  Oh DEER  See what I did there Because one of the main characters is a DEER Or DOE you not know what Im talking about ,10
206070,172번,Open Season,8,This movie is kinda funny and I think it is a good family movie to watch  The only part that you want to know is that Shaw uses a gun to try to hunt the animals  Other than that I recommend you watch it,3
206071,172번,Open Season,8,Personally I think it has a good story line and that little kids will laugh at the content  the only bit I may find a bit worrying is that they are being hunted and that when I was little it made me a bit afraid  It it OK though in my opinion as it ticked a lot of boxes but is was sad as the bear was separated from his mother and got PUT TO SLEEP  Be careful with your child as you would do with another p g,4
206072,172번,Open Season,8,It was sooo boring Also one use of the C word  Im glad other users caught that  Heres the scene  Boog is sitting on some sort of haylike thing and Elliot is trying to convince him to poop  Then he says Come on start crappin   After that I changed it to The Spongebob Movie  Watch that movie instead,8
206104,175번,"Our Friend, Martin",8,This movie was educational enough but there definitely was some iffy language   Also is this just me or did they draw a six grader like an eighteen yr old  I dunno if its just the drawing style but Maria seems a tad bit sexualized,3
206105,175번,"Our Friend, Martin",8,There was some violence like old reallife videos of police assaulting protesters bullying and an offscreen shooting  A house is bombed as well and black kids are being called racial slurs  Along with drinking drugs and smoking a dad smokes in the car  The language is brief some mean words being called to people and a dad in a car yelling mean things to other cars in front of him,4
206106,175번,"Our Friend, Martin",8,In some of them middle of the movie someones dad is smokeing,1
206426,186번,Paddington,7,funny family friendly,1
206427,186번,Paddington,7,This movie was pretty good But my 7 year old sister started freaking out at the crazy lady  She ran to the theater bathroom and stayed there for most of the duration of the movie  This was AWESOME  But the second movie was better,4
206428,186번,Paddington,7,I really enjoyed this flimbut I think if you are under 8 you might get nightmares because theres a bit of violence in it which could scare little ones But its still a good flim,1
206429,186번,Paddington,7,Beartastic  sorry about the pun it is amazing and heartfelt movie that has funny scenes   It is a movie that all ages can laugh at   Yes there is an evil woman that is trying to turn Paddington into a stuffed bear but there are so many other great scenes that are more memorable than that,4
206430,186번,Paddington,7,Paddington is a fun family film at times but at other times you feel like it doesnt fit that description  I believe this is more of a scare than the sequel that came out recently  Millicent the main antagonist wants to stuff Paddington since he is part of a rare species and she wants him for her collection  This theme is believed by me to only go well with kids eight or older  There was an iffy word as well that probably isnt the best for a kidsfamily film  The word sexy is spoken in a scene where Mr  Brown dresses up as a lady  Paddington does bring a few good things like how Mr  Brown eventually got on board with the idea of having Paddington and the rest of the Brown family consider Paddington true family,7
206431,186번,Paddington,7,This movie is really well done,2
206432,186번,Paddington,7,PADDINGTON is a really positive movie about a family that find a bear and look after it  There may be scenes that are scary for young children but it is a very good movie,2
206433,186번,Paddington,7,The movie kind of freaked me out and made me want to run screaming from the movie theatre,1
206434,186번,Paddington,7,Why is it for six year olds I watched it with my little brother who is three and he seemed to like it  The best part is when Paddington did all those weird things in the bathroom,3
206435,186번,Paddington,7,In this movie there is nothing to worry about  I just love the good messages that the all the good role models,2
206455,186번,Paddington,7,The only parts i think were bad was when the women was flirting with the neighbor,1
206456,186번,Paddington,7,Paddington is a great movie  The only thing I may worn is that even though Milicentnot telling who she is is not meant to be scary she may seem to be a little intence for kids younger then 8  Of course its a meant for family movie  There is nothing inapprocriate at all  This is from a kids point of view so adults may have a different opinion  Great movie overall though,6
206457,186번,Paddington,7,I loved it  Ben Whishaw and the rest of the cast were excellent especially Whishaw as the voice of Paddington  One of the best family films I have ever seen,3
206458,186번,Paddington,7,I think  that kids under 10 should NOT pay to watch this movie There is an evil animal and people murderer who is after Paddington mostly the whole movie  But it is still pretty sweet NO WAY so all I am trying to say is it is too violent and stressful for kids under ten,3
206459,186번,Paddington,7,I think it is great  but there is mild violence so I rated it eight and up,1
206460,186번,Paddington,7,Great Movie 4 Paddington rated PG 5 OF 5 STARS ON Review SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Good,2
206461,186번,Paddington,7,Great movie funny and family friendly  A few funny references to the mission impossible series which young kids may not get  fine for children but Paddington himself is put in a lot of peril being shot at getting stuck in an incinerator and being put in a taxidermy van  The family itself has gret messages and paddington is a funny charecter their is a scene where Ms byrd is in a drinking contest and appears drunk even though they are never shown drinking alcohol  I also think your kids might be tempted to buy paddington books and stuffed animals,4
206462,186번,Paddington,7,I think it was really good because it had lots of good messageshumor and great role models  Kids between the ages of 10  12 may not like it as much although,2
206463,186번,Paddington,7,This movie was great What an awesome story everyone should watch this  There is some stuff sensitive parents may feel is not appropriate for younger children like the fact that the main antagonist is trying to stuff paddington  But nothing violent is shown so its fine for ages 6 and up and iffy for ages 5 and under,4
206464,186번,Paddington,7,Funny funny funny  Cant escape from funnyland  When Paddington went on his bathtub boat was my favorite part,3
206548,193번,Paper Planes,7,Can be a bit sad but it is good,1
206549,193번,Paper Planes,7,Paper planes is a really good film but its sad at times  Kimi and Dylan pretty nice,2
206550,193번,Paper Planes,7,Pretty cool,1
206551,193번,Paper Planes,7,paper planes is the best movie ever,2
206552,193번,Paper Planes,7,The movie is ok but a bit with acupuncture might be scary for young kids  There isnt any blood,2
206553,193번,Paper Planes,7,PAPER PLANES is nearly overflowed with positive messages  I think it is a great film for families,2
206554,193번,Paper Planes,7,Im using this film for a film study at school so I watched the movie for the first time not some thing I usually watch but surprisingly overall I loved this movie now one of my favourite movies it show cases that bullys can turn into friends and your family can be once again your rock if you give them time to heal from their scares,1
206555,193번,Paper Planes,7,Its amazing but it is  sad in some parts  Its inspired  me to make my own paper planes and to give things a go,2
207279,224번,Pitch Perfect,8,This is a great musical movie  I know people as young as 7 watch this but I think waiting till 13 is a better idea,2
207280,224번,Pitch Perfect,8,Pitch Perfect is a great movie that cuts right to the heart but it also has a lot of swearing consumerism and a bit of sex  Very good messages about never giving up  but kids under 11  might want to think twice about it,2
207281,224번,Pitch Perfect,8,Enough said,1
207282,224번,Pitch Perfect,8,This movie has to be my favorite movie of all time  I have seen it over 10 times and it never gets old   The singing and acting is amazing and the movie is over all hilarious,3
207283,224번,Pitch Perfect,8,I loved this movie so much I watched it in the plane and I needed up laughing out loud at so many parts  I feel like the other passengers on the plane thought I was a little weird  The music and dancing is also really amazing  It makes me just want to get up and start grooving   I defiantly recommend this movie for teens,6
207284,224번,Pitch Perfect,8,I am 13 and I loved this movie you have to be kinda mature to  see it there is some language issues but it didnt bother me any   There is at least 2 or 3 scenes were she throws up  But again that didnt bother me  I absolutely loved it and think other kids my age would to,4
207285,224번,Pitch Perfect,8,This movie is halarious and great for a mature 11 year old  Some inappropriate things were said like bich and sit  In the beginning a girl introduce herself to Becca the main character and tells her where her room and gives her a whistle and says This is your official Bardon university rapist whistle  Do blow it unless its really happening  Also there were a bunch of college kids at a party drinking and one girl says that she needs her jiggle juice  One girl admits to having lots of sx  One point in an a cepella riff offa battle between a Capella groups they have categories and one of them was songs about sx and then they started singing about it  That was a little awkward when watching it  Overallthis movie was entertaining and fun to watch other than the bad stuff  I loved it and Im still waiting to see the second one,10
207286,224번,Pitch Perfect,8,This movie fallows Beca a girl in collage who is a DJ  At the school there a five acapella groups and one of then is the Barden Bellas the best acapella group there is the troubles  Then beca gets invited to join the Bellas after they lost a conniption because on of the Bellas threw up on everyone  So then Beca decideds to join and try to them good again  This movie is extremely vulgar and racy there is tons of gay and lesbian jokes implied racy content a scene in a show with breasts visible extremely crass and explicit references about racy content some kissing and some inappropriate gestures  There is also tons of constant vulgar language including 30 uses of st fk sltbags dk py ps  etc  There is lots of underage drinking partying and drug use throughout  There is no violence at all but its suspenseful if ether going to win or not  This movie is fantastic amazing hilarious fun and enjoyable but to racy for teens  My ratingR for strong racy contentnudity throughout pervasive language graphic nudity strong alcohol and drug use and vulgar references,10
207454,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Great comedy has only one bad scene when a man says the FWord about 30 times in a row  The rest is either a light PG13 or a strong PG,2
207455,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Good but smoking and language,1
207456,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Although this movie  has an iconic tirade with fk repeatedly just about everything else is PGappropriate  It is a great thanksgiving movie for somewhat older kids and a very funny movie anytime,2
207457,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Funny comedy just has a brief scene of strong language okay for kids 11 and up,1
207458,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,One of the best comedies,1
207459,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Planes  trains and automobiles is a funny yet sad comedy about two strangers whos flight is delayed and they share a room together and go on an adventure  Ther is a scene with a lot of uses of the f word and more language   through the whole movie  It is not sexual or crude  Must watch,4
207460,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Sure theres some bad language but its not horrible and its very funny and great for kids 10 if you are younger than 10 I recommend you have a parent approval  Enjoy the movie,2
207461,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,As far as I can say this is a very good movie although I did see some adultish jokes I think this is perfectly suitable for kids 13,1
207462,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Honestly this movie is fine for 13 year olds if you skip the scene in which Steve Martin uses the dreaded Fbomb  this actually would have been a pg movie if they would have removed this scene  The only major issue here is the language,3
207463,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,I like how two friends stay together to get to the guys house  It shows how you should stay together no matter what  Thats just what you do,3
207576,235번,Poltergeist,7,This movie is good but has a one minute sequence of flashing lights in the beginning and a really long sequence of flashing lights 1520 minutes near the end  So this movie contains a lot of sequences of flashing lights that may affect viewers with epilepsy or any other photosensitivity,2
207577,235번,Poltergeist,7,I think this movie is great for youngsters who like scarygory stuff,1
207578,235번,Poltergeist,7,Poltergeist has not aged well  It also isnt that scary  The tree coming to life and the goofy clown doll dont just scare like they should  Some scenes work well though  The nightmarish scene when the man tears his face in the mirror is truly great stuff  Overall though not particularly frightening,6
207579,235번,Poltergeist,7,If you can watch Harry Potter it is fine for you,1
207580,235번,Poltergeist,7,Aside from the face peeling scene  in which the effects are quite outdated  this movie has no blood and gore and leaves the scares to the supernatural happenings throughout the film  It is definitely not however for any kids under 1011 as it brings the kids beloved toy into the evil action with the  already creepy  toy clown  It is scary but the parents set great examples because they are very committed to saving their family  A few swear words are included but overall there isnt too much profanity,4
207581,235번,Poltergeist,7,This is the cheesiest trippiest ghost film ever   I know it was original when it came out but now everything in it is clich and poorly executed compared to its followers  A small amount of violence and the parents do drugs but nothing much else inappropriate  Dont watch this film for entertainment  I guess its worth watching if you want to see the inspiration behind better ghost films such as insidious and the conjuring  25 stars,6
207582,235번,Poltergeist,7,Poltergeist is a family horror movie that is fairly scary  The violence isnt too bad but in one particularly gross scene a man rips his face off and reveals his bloody skull  The scene is in the mans head which could make it a little less frightening  The family is fearless and strong in the face of danger and will stop at nothing to bring back their daughter from the Other Side  They can teach kids to always work for what you want and dont give up  The swearing is fairly moderate with a few cases of btch st damn and hell  Overall this movie should be suitable for a 10 yo child,7
207583,235번,Poltergeist,7,Steven Spielberg classic   Good but scary,2
207777,239번,Ponyo,6,I just watched this movie with my little sister today  We both loved it and Im 14 It was really cute and I love Miyazakis movies  Studio Ghiblis artwork and animation is beautiful and amazing  Even if you think youre too old for it go see it anyway you wont be disappointed,5
207778,239번,Ponyo,6,This Movie is My Fav Movie Ever It Made Me Love Anime Now I Watch Fruits Basket Toradora and Other Animes all Because of This Movie and I Watched When I Was 6 and Became an Instant Miyazaki Fan  I Really Love This Movie,3
207779,239번,Ponyo,6,A great movie Mostly for younger kids but your older ids can still watch it and I dont now how they couldnt love it,2
207780,239번,Ponyo,6,I am a huge fan of Studio Ghiblis films  The animation is fantastic and the plot is very cute  I dont know why people are having a cow over the breastfeeding line though because THATS WHAT THEYRE FOR  Its better for kids to learn here instead of school right Anyways yeah I love all of Mizayakis works and this is definatley a good movie,5
207781,239번,Ponyo,6,Firstly let me get one thing clear this wasnt a bad film  I actually think its a good opportunity for family members to come together and watch a friendly film with the kids  Its cute and strange definitely  visually breathtaking  These are all very good things that keep kids enlightened and entertained But for the most part Ponyo is simply a story about a little fish girl who falls in love with a human boy and they spend the entire movie acting cute while the world ends  There are two points I need to address here one being the storyline is just fine for kids but for adults it could get boring  I mean all it really is is this adorable fiveyearold love story which to be honest with you isnt overwhelming  But what about the world ending you ask isnt that overwhelming That is what I am going to address in my second point  The whole issue with the world ending I think that was just Hayao Miyazakis attempt to throw some massive adventure in there and to tell you the truth I think he COULD have done better  The end of the world as we all now is a major deal  However the people in the movie treat it as a minor inconvenience as if they hadnt just lost all their homes and possessions  Also nobody even questions why all this is happening or why there are frightening ancient fish underwater  They simply go along with it which I gotta say is the very thing that makes this movie underwhelming  Its underwhelming people put in and overwhelming situation and when that happens you KNOW the situation is going to be a whole lot more bland than before  So in itself Ponyo is a memorable film mostly for its quirkiness and nonstop adorableness  Seriously the cutsey moments in this movie are too much to bare  This paired with the fantastic animation is why most people tend to see Ponyo as a masterpiece  With all this in mind Pony now seems a bit overrated to me  I mean sure its a pretty good movie except for the story and it did its job well as a kids film  But theres allot of waiting and once I saw Ponyo the second time I fell asleep halfway through  Some things parents need to know This movie is perfect for kids  Its not scary or spooky its just different and strange but sometimes people mix up the two  Ponyo is a good film for all ages Most of the time,24
207782,239번,Ponyo,6,I love this movie to death I remember going to theaters watching this with my mom in the summer time  This is a great movie for little kids but they might get a funny feeling watching the kind of animation  I suggest this for 9yrs and up but you can let your children watch it  When I was 5 I liked anime a little bit  But now Im a lover of anime Watch this with your kids its a must see In the summer time when it is raining outside I go watch some anime movies or some shows and if my big brother isnt busyhe watches anime too  Me and my brother are freaks of anime movies and shows  Try and do that with your family,10
207783,239번,Ponyo,6,great movie,1
208003,254번,Princess Mononoke,8,I would say that the creepiest things in the movie were the demons  both were covered in wormssnakes  there is lots of violence even though the main character kind of uses violence as a last resort  2 peoples heads are shot off of their bodys using arrows  and there is lots of blood  there is some profanity I completely loved the movie,6
208004,254번,Princess Mononoke,8,Beauty meets violence in this gorgeously crafted anime movie  Ashitaka is a young prince in a faroff village protecting his people with his life along with his trusty elk Yakul  When he is inflicted with a terrible demons curse he sets out on an epic adventure to find his true self lift the curse and save the forest  But into his midst comes a mysterious princess known as Princess Mononoke  This is probably one of Hayao Miyazakis greatest  and more violent  movies  The animation is absolutely breathtaking Miyazaki can craft anything from an agile red elk to a sparkling tranquil forest to a demongod larger than an elephant  But watch out for graphic violence  SPOILER ALERTS At the beginning of the movie Ashitaka and his friend are attacked by a horrible demon that appears to be a boar covered in swirling worms  When Ashitaka kills it the flesh disappears from its body and the bloody skeleton is left behind  However Ashitaka is left with a steaming wound that the elders say is destined to kill him  Kids might be upset when Ashitaka has to leave the only home hes ever known to lift the curse upon him  At another village Ashitaka witnesses a bloody massacre in which his wounded arm swells and seems to has a mind of its own it causes him to accidentally cut off someones arms and another persons entire head  In a heavy rainstorm Lady Eboshi and her men fight a wolf one person shoots the wolf and sets it on fire briefly and it falls off a cliff  Later we see Princess Mononoke usually called San come into the story for the first time she finds the old wolf on the banks of a river and she sucks and spits out the blood from the wolfs bullet wound her mouth becomes covered in blood  After Ashitaka arrives in Irontown the central village of the story San attacks the citizens of Irontown along with her two wolfs there is a sword fight between San Ashitaka and Lady Eboshi  When Ashitaka knocks Lady Eboshi unconscious he is shot through the stomach but continues to advance through the village without any apparent struggle  An ancient boar called Okkoto becomes covered in the same swirling worms as the boar at the beginning of the movie and San becomes trapped within the worms on his face Okkoto appears to become a demon and San almost becomes one too  One of the main conflicts of the story is based on the keeping of the peace between the humans and the forest  However not all want it to be that way  Lady Eboshi strives to kill the Forest Spirit and give the head of the creature to a man named Jigo who says he will help her people in return  She succeeds in cutting off the head of the spirit of the forest the rest of the spirits body turns into a creature made of dark lifelike ooze that kills a living thing instantly upon contact  Lady Eboshis arm is then bitten off by a wolf  These are just a portion of the many violent scenes of this movie all of which are fairly bloody and gory but are still amazing and entrancing to watch  Language includes damn piss and bastard but there is really no sex  For those who are afraid of blood or watching peoples limbs get ripped from their bodies this will be too scary andor violent  But for those who are huge Miyazaki fans and are okay with the violence bloody and all it will be an actionpacked joyride that they wont soon forget,26
208005,254번,Princess Mononoke,8,OK first off this movie is violent  People are killed and peoples limbs fall off  The PG13 rating is right,3
208006,254번,Princess Mononoke,8,What you need to know is I hate gory movies although this movie did have some gore All the violence in the beginning is pretty quick and at some parts comical  near the end it gets pretty gory but is still manageable  There are a lot of people on hear saying they showed it to their six year old Its rated pg13 so you dont show it to youngsters I mean really cmon people the front has a picture of a girl with blood on her face and guy with a sword and scar  If you cannot handle gore whatsoever dont watch this  If you can handle some and not get scared watch it right now it is so good,5
208007,254번,Princess Mononoke,8,It is violent but not too violent  when i first watched it i was 8 and i loved it,2
208008,254번,Princess Mononoke,8,An absolutely amazing movie with intense action fair amounts of blood an amazing soundtrack and an amazing story that you wont forget anytime soon  This movie is amazing and a great choice for families that enjoy Japanese movies and anime,2
208009,254번,Princess Mononoke,8,The animation and story is very unique and focuses on the story of a teenage boy trying to lift a curse caused by a hateful demon  It discusses how violence and hatred brings trouble to people and how humans are destroying the environment with their greed  A more mature and significantly better animated Fern Gully  I would NOT recommend this to anyone who doesnt like blood or body gore there is only 23 scenes with this but I found it uncomfortable to watch  I also noticed a few cuss words ass a few times damn 34 times and bastard once,5
208010,254번,Princess Mononoke,8,This is the sequel to the 1995s hit The Flying Castle but this 1 adds more gory violence and graphic killing with lots of gore  This drama has tons of bloodygraphicdisturbing and shocking violence characters are slicedstabbedshotblown to bits etc  There are also lots of gory images including a girl eating a wolf and spitting the blood from her mouthblood is seen splatteringlots of pools blood and some very graphic woundssome disturbing and very gory content  There is no swearing or racy content but there is some drinking and flirting  This sequel is epic and very thrilling but due to strong bloody violence its and iffy choice for teens  My ratingR for bloody and graphic violence throughoutdisturbing contentimagesand intense sequences of gruesome and bloody images,6
208283,264번,Puss in Boots,7,Its a swashbuckling adventure that features the irresistible warrior cat,1
208284,264번,Puss in Boots,7,It is hilarious but has some rude humor that adults will get but not little kids  It has some suitable lessons like trust and the bond between friends  My family enjoys it every time but personally I think it is best if whoever is watching it is at least 7 or 8,3
208285,264번,Puss in Boots,7,This show is very good but I think the death character in this movie is too scary,1
208286,264번,Puss in Boots,7,I loved everything about the movie most movies have a pros and cons list but I cant think of anything negative to say about this The pacing was good the villan atchually scared me and the story was easy to understand I didnt come out of the theater with questions as usual  I am putting 5 and up because they do reference curse words by bleeping the characters and cutting to another scene,5
208287,264번,Puss in Boots,7,Funny sweethearted take on classic hero,1
208288,264번,Puss in Boots,7,I have seen the 2011 SpinOff and it is one of my favorite DreamWorks SpinOffs next to Penguins Of Madagascar Guys its Puss In Boots thats the way he is you watched Shrek and it was inappropriate and Puss In Boots is a part of the Shrek Franchise,1
208289,264번,Puss in Boots,7,Contains cartoonish fantasy violence throughout not many sexual content apart from Puss being coo over his flirtatious sidekick little to no profanity  There is a gag about how catnip mimics marijuana and how it cures Puss glaucoma,2
208290,264번,Puss in Boots,7,Wella movie about Puss in Boots  It doesnt work 100with the wrting being somewhat weak and the new characters unmemorablebut at least Antonito reprises his role and the animation is good,2
208291,264번,Puss in Boots,7,This movie should always have a five star rating   Its awesome Many people may like it,3
208436,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,Ralph is a big baby in this  It shows the dark web and criminal activity  And when Ralph and Vanellope were at eBay Vanellope looked at sections and said Sports     food    big baby clothes Something called lingerie    Should they be putting tHAT IN A KIDS MOVIE And Ralph and Vanellope go to a root beer cavern and seem pretty strange after,6
208437,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,i love it ,1
208438,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,Slighty swearing no nudity slighty violence but too much consumerism theres fortniteinstagram ebay youtube GTA disney DC Marvel and more Great role models,2
208439,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,I think this movie is very creative and good for younger kids   but its kind of cheesy for older kids,2
208440,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,Disney has out done itself by going out to explore the internet world This is an amazing sequel although I prefer it to be watched by kids 10 and above due to high violence and the internet has some crazy stuff not for kids  It also depicts the strength of friendship,3
208441,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,AWESOME NEED TO WATCH,1
208442,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,Ralph Breaks The Internet has quite a bit of consumerism and most people wont leave without knowing the name of one of the companies shown in the film   While traveling into the Dark Web we do encounter many scary viruses and glitches though    The movie is still okay for young audiences though,3
208443,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,The movie itself was pretty solid with it emphasizing about tech today and using terms and and tips to help kids today use the internet  The thing is that the plot is confusing  SPOILERS AHEAD,4
208444,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,Sequels are supposed to be more mature and darker but this film  Its more friendlier and better  I love how every single moment of this movie especially when they reach the internet because almost everything they saw in the internet was real except that Google was Mr Knowsmore and Buzzztube was YouTube  I 100 recommend to everyone except preschooler because this movie has a lot of very mild swearing and the virus scene is very scary for younger or sensetive kids  Look I watched this when I was 11 I was still scared when Ralph became a virus  So dont worry,6
208445,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,really good,1
208506,282번,Ratatouille,6,Cute rat tale has some peril and potentially scary moments,1
208507,282번,Ratatouille,6,Some people might say that the characters in Ratatouille are unrealistic but actually the characters include a lot of true and dramatic character traits like rudeness and jealousy  Not only are the traits in the characters is fabulous but also the storyline is great  The story started out with the main character introducing himself to us then as the rat family got exposed they were forced to the drain which led them to Paris  In Paris he succeeded in his dreams  I like how the story included the dish Occitan Occitan is a French Provenal dish of stewed vegetables  About the theme main lesson in a story there was a man that kept jumping out to tell the rat not to give up or stop his dreams  For example sometimes in life risking your dreams or doing something unexpected can lead to a successful ending,7
208508,282번,Ratatouille,6,I  pirated this movie and still want a refund,1
208509,282번,Ratatouille,6,Remy a provincial rat with a wonderful sense of smell hates garbage and risks death to enter a human kitchen where he discovers real food and the cooking of fivestar chef Anton Gusteau author of Anyone Can Cook  On the day Remy learns his hero has died he is evicted and ends up alone in Paris  By luck he discovers Gasteaus restaurant down to three stars and run by a frozenfoodhawking chef  As Remy enters so does Linguini a clumsy youth hired as a garbage boy  To save the soup that Linguini accidentally fouls Remy throws in some ingredients the soup is a success and Linguinis career as a chef is born  Can Remy find a way to maintain the fiction and use his gift,6

208511,282번,Ratatouille,6,This movie changed my life,1
208512,282번,Ratatouille,6,A classic that I think is great for anyone,1
208513,282번,Ratatouille,6,I was watching this movie and it was fine until I heard someone say Ratatooing here and also one problem is that theres no Mickey Mouse here  Education Value has none there is a some drinking and it says Ratatooing a lot  It catches Atai Omurzakov dancer man as WALLE  And yeah I recommend for 22,3
208733,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,i love this movie every time i watch i i pick up on something new that just adds to the story and makes it so much better and its so interesting,1
208734,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,so let me get this out first  I couldnt really focus on the movie so my review might have mistakes,2
208735,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Its fine  Nothing I personally enjoyed  The animation and voice acting do make it bearable  Its not the best of Disneys animated movies but its perfectly serviceable family entertainment  I didnt have that much interest in it but Im sure others will,5
208736,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Raya and the Last Dragon was another fun heroine movie from Disney I liked it but Raya looks just like Moana and the storyline is kind of like it too  Overall its worth it to watch it though  I think kids 67 and up are totally ok to watch it,4
208737,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Good ol movie  Has good action scenes and messages but heres a quick tip for parents Sometimes they imply swear words like a and b,2
208738,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,I dont want to pay 30 plus my existing Disney Plus subscription  Aquafina is awful and so is her design  It looks like a 4 year old picked up crayons and drew her mom a blue dragon  I dont understand how Disney went from Moana to Rays and the last dragon  It is unfunny and cringe worthy  I dont know why this film attempts to immerse you in the time period when you have Aquafina making a joke about being in a school project  Why was this in the movie Maybe she is a time traveler like the genie  I normally dont get this mad over Disney movies but I am mad  I payed 30 dollars and wished I got that money back  I dont underestimate Disneys talent because this movie is gorgeous but that doesnt fix the multiple problems  Im sorry Disney but you need to get your act together  There is a positive message hidden behind the lackluster jokes but it is covered in Disneys blockbuster coat,13
208739,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Positive messages a bit tense at moments,1
208740,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Raya and the Last Dragon is a great film  I really hoped this film could live up to my expectations and for the most part it did  It feels pretty good to have a good Disney film again considering I hadnt loved some of their newest films  Im not sure if its worth 30 to watch it on Disney but the decision is up to you,4
208741,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,this movie is such a good family movie  People get turned into statues by an evil spirit thing but thats as bad as it gets  it is very funny there is some fighting there is no swearing and the main charicters are great role models,3
208742,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Great,1
209634,330번,Royal Wedding,8,This movie is really romantic and great dancing   Fred Astaire and Jane Powell are great dancers and really a cute brother and sister  in the movie ,2
210382,361번,Scooby-Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur,6,Amazing,1
210383,361번,Scooby-Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur,6,I think this was too scary for younger kids   A good movie for tweens but nothing younger,2
210595,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,Its appropriate I liked how it included Rich Brian and 88 rising,1
210596,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,This was a great way to get back to theaters  This movie lived up to my expectations  The whole time my heart was racing it could have been the butter on my popcorn but that doesnt matter  The fight choreography is stunning the writing is fine as wine in the summertime  The costumes are to the nine and the visual effects are breathtaking  I highly recommend this movie,6
210597,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,great fight scenes and amazing cgi safe for most kids and even toddlers to watch,1
210598,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,very good movie with good messages and themes  super funny movie that the whole family should enjoy,3
210599,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,There is some language a few uses of st and one mouthing of fk  Lots of martial arts violence  Cast is mainly Asian  Movie has great messages,4
210600,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,Parents in my opinion the only thing you really need to worry about is when someone  says the v word once  However this is only based on your childs maturity,2
210601,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,I think kids should see this to know that there are all sorts of heroes not only white americans  Great ChineseAmerican tale amazing storyline and phenominal graphics  A joke about a ladys genitals and BS jacka sht hell damn and btch were repeated a lot throughout the movie so watch out for that  Amazing messages but a lot of violence and gore  A man was kicked in the testicles once  Otherwise amazing,6
210602,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,VIOLENCE Shangs father built quite a reputation after his wife died by killing those responsible  But it didnt end there  He continued his brutal behavior for another 10 years before his wife started calling to him asking him to safe her  Spoilers The voice was not his wife but a mimic created by the ancient beast called the Dweller  Similar creatures end up attacking a village sucking the souls from its occupants  To describe the process the creatures grab the victim and absorb a glowing orb from their body their soul  Other fighting sequences in the movie are mainly martial arts  People are stabbed punched and kicked in all sorts of ways  Some assassins fall from tall scaffolding and some fall off cliffs,9
210603,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,I loved this movie It got a little confusing at the end but it was still amazing  It was also very funny   If you are worried about inappropriate stuff the girl Katy references vagina 2 times    when they are talking abt childbirth and abt changing names normal name Gina to slang gina I love this movie though,6
210604,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,SHANG CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS  The movie was EXCELLENT and for me i am a huge huge huge MARVEL fan and for me it is on of the best some languege Like S and B and stuff like that violence is average for 10 and over either then that you should approve to watch the movie GREAT MOVIE,2
210651,387번,Sharknado,8,I think Sharknado is an awesome movie but there is a lot of vilonse and suffering between character  There is also a few kissing sense  Also the language is very harsh  Other than that Sharknado is a great movie There is also a great role model,5
210652,387번,Sharknado,8,This is a great BMovie for ages 10 and up  The whole plot of the movie is laughing as people are killed by sharks that fall out of the sky but its so bad that its good  The only thing to worry about is violence and gore which looks like a video game  So if your kids can handle Call of Duty theyll be fine  This movie is great for a movie night,5
210653,387번,Sharknado,8,This movie is so funny It is literally the worst movie I have ever seen which makes it that much better You should watch it Sharks start swarming in a hurricane and rain down on people  Everything is fake and really hilarious  The main characters are comical and sometimes a little stupid  A lot gets destroyed and a few people die  But its obviously fake so it will not scare most people  However dont show it to your little kids,9
210654,387번,Sharknado,8,This movie interested me because I like shark stuff  There is plenty of violence in this movie  Sharks eating people or even just biting off their legs or their arms  There is a tornado with sharks inside and they have to find a way to survive  A girl is inside a shark and it shows you a man cutting the shark and taking her out of it  There is no sex besides kissing and the language is not strong  People say shit and hell and that is all  There is some drinking in this movie but you should not be worried about that  Nothing happens after they drink they do not get drunk or anything like that  I think that this movie is okay for kids ages 14 and up because most of the deaths are gruesome  WATCH IT IF YOU ARE 14 AND OLDER THOUGH BECAUSE IT IS AN AMAZING MOVIE,11
210655,387번,Sharknado,8,This movie is amazing  There is a lot of blood and I mean a lot  But the blood looks fake   Their is some bad language but I think that a twelve year old kid should be allowed to watch it  The effects are not well done at all  If they were that would be a different story,6
210656,387번,Sharknado,8,I hate this movie sooooooooooooooooooooooooo much I love it   Amazing  So funny  With the scene with the school bus look at the name on the side of the bus,4
210657,387번,Sharknado,8,My ratingNC17 for extreme goreextreme bloodextreme violenceand some sexual content,1
210975,392번,Shazam!,8,There are some inappropriate staff for young kids but beside that its really funny  It is also a little bit scary but only for young kids  You should really watch that,3
210976,392번,Shazam!,8,I have seen many scary movies in my life but this one literally gave me a painc attack  The monsters are scarier than IT the clown the violence is insane and there is a scene where the whole family walks out of a strip club because Shazam teleported them there  This movie should NOT be 12 it should be for very mature teens  I will never ever see this movie again and neither should any other kid,4
210977,392번,Shazam!,8,I went to see it with my mum and two brothers8 14 and was generally happy with what I saw the boardroom scene is a bit intense for some children but I see so many Asia Ltd over reacting about it they should have done more research  Theres a strip club seen witch is questionable but understandable at the same time  Great movie,3
210978,392번,Shazam!,8,It was a great funny movie but there were things that were really scary and a lot of violence me and my friend called the creatures tongue gremlins because they had gnarled warted drooling tongues and they were called the seven deadly sins from Pandoras box in Greek mythology and the bible they were really scary and there was a lot of high pitched screaming and people turning to ash which was unsettling it was a very scary movie but nothing  inappropriate,1
210979,392번,Shazam!,8,Okay so Im 9 this year a Gifted Education Program kid studying in Singapore  I understood the plot very well and although there was a bit of violent parts inside the movie it was not too scary  However you can still watch the movie if you are aged 7 and below just skip the first part and pretend to go to the toilet for about 15 mins then return back to the cinema  For the rest do NOT skip any part of the movie even if it was scary go to the toilet only if you want to pee or poo  I will tell you the 2 scary parts in this movie,5
210980,392번,Shazam!,8,Shazam is great  I was no tscared of the boardroom scene because there is no blood at all and cant see much killing later because its all behind a frosted glass  I did not notice any sex in the movie there is  no kissing at all  I thought the characters FreddyBilly and Shazam are funny people that probably want to know about superheros and know have there own superhero  I liked the movie so much that I watched it twice  I recommend  my friends and other kids to watch the movie,6
210981,392번,Shazam!,8,WARNING SPOILERS   I can see why some people might enjoy this film the humour the superheroes the action  But honestly its way too scary for children,3
210982,392번,Shazam!,8,Its a very good film with a little bit of violence and swearing BUT it has got some positive messages  I think kids can watch it D,2
211163,403번,Shrek,8,I personally love the movie along with thousands of other people who had the blessing of seeing the classic movie but there is a bit of cussing and inside jokes that some people might understand  Most kids at the age of 8 has at least heard swearing somewhere before so thats why I think 8 is the appropriate age to see Shrek  Children learn about puberty somewhere around the age of 8 so I think its safe to say that it is an appropriate age to see Shrek,3

211167,403번,Shrek,8,Shrek Is an Amazing Movie I have always loved this movie and the whole series in general this movie still is funny till this day  Eddie murphy as Donkey is so fun to be around in this movie also Shrek Is so Good The best he has ever been Lord Farquad is a believable villain All the performances is good also all of them are not much to say such a classic to Watch I Give Shrek An A,1
211168,403번,Shrek,8,preceding the middling Shrek The Third  the fan favorite Shrek 2 and my personal favorite Shrek Forever After,1
211169,403번,Shrek,8,I saw this movie when I was 8 it was on Cartoon Network though never watched the whole entire thing I noticed something inappropriate for a kids film  A PG Rating but well but before that I never heard those until I noticed one  then I watched a video of the cursing scenes with occasional Mild profanity as its used a whole lot While the violence or anything inappropriate isnt too much the Language is im giving this a PG13 Rating Due to The Language,1
211170,403번,Shrek,8,I loved this and still do  Great movie,2
211171,403번,Shrek,8,Its fine but    Theres a bit of swearing but there great messages and role modles  So i would belive this is for kids age 11 and up,2
211234,403번,Shrek,7,When I first watched this film I was a year old and my parents say I used to love it  I would watch shrek 3 times a day inless they had to go out  My parents couldnt believe it  Thats probably why they told me,4
211235,403번,Shrek,7,While simultaneously embracing and subverting fairy tales the irreverent Shrek also manages to tweak Disneys nose provide a moral message to children and offer viewers a funny fastpaced ride,1
211236,403번,Shrek,7,this movie was made before i was born but i still love it but also be warned that there is a lot of mild swearing for a kids movie but kids probably wont understand it,1
211237,403번,Shrek,7,I didnt see this movie when I was young unlike most other kids  And ive just recently watched it  I still found many scenes funny as the jokes appeal to almost every age  Unlike that garbage movie Alvin and the chipmunks,4
211238,403번,Shrek,7,Has great messages and a satisfying story,1
211239,403번,Shrek,7,I thought that Shrek had a great story and was well written  However there are uses of ass damn and hell  Also Princess Fiona shows a bit of cleavage  Nothing too concerning but heads up for parents,4
211240,403번,Shrek,7,I know I watched this a lot when I was little and I watched it on long road trips but I just watched it again with my little brother age 5 and I am starting to notice this movie has multiple adult jokes for older kids  Again I didnt remember anything from when I was younger so it should go over their heads  Swears said damn as crap jackas kissas stupid  and a line said keep your feet of the grass wash your hands wipe your face and another line that people keep reporting but I am 11 and I still dont understand so    Its fine  For violence there is a fire breathing dragon knights fighting and more fighting not graphic its pretty funny and I wouldnt worry too much,5
211241,403번,Shrek,7,Shrek is a sweetfunny film for all of the family  Donkey is very funny and has some good jokes and all the characters have strong personalities  This film has themes of inner beauty and acceptance  Overall it is a lot fun and I would recommend it for kids,4
211242,403번,Shrek,7,MOVIE INFO,1
211243,403번,Shrek,7,Dont let your little one watch this movie unless you want you kids saying bad words that I dont care to repeat   But other then that its a really good movie,2
211555,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,This is my favorite movie of all time  There is just one number that you shouldnt show your young kids  Its called Make em Laugh  Cosmo Brown is just flipping off walls which might make your kid hurt themselves trying to do it  Other than that its a great movie that you should watch,5
211556,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,I enjoyed the movie Singin In The Rain it was a comical movie  My favorite character was Cosmo he had a lot of funny moments  I think that kids will love to watch this movie because of how funny it is  My one favorite song was Make Em Laugh by Cosmo,4
211557,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,I think that this is a good classic movie  Considering that it is a musical with catchy musicI didnt think that there was too much singing in it  The story wasnt to complex but I still enjoyed watching the movie,3
211558,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,A definite classic There is a lot of kissing and a whole lot of singing  Many parts show behind the scenes of making a movie in the silent era  When they are approached with movies with audio they need to get in position  It shows what is needed for a show to go on with some what I would call unnecessary singing,5
211559,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,This movie is great  For a G rating it does have some smoking kissing and some comical violence in the Make Em Laugh scene but not any other bad stuff,3
211560,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,A classic for the Whole Family that is just great,1
211561,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,Singin in the Rain is a wonderful classic musical for the whole family  There are several kisses and champagne and cigars are shown  Also there are some suggestive outfits for only a few shots though  The worst the language gets is dumb and dope  An aweinspiring soundtrack and a whimsical storyline make this musical about American stardom in the 1920s a fantastic film everyone is sure to love,5
211562,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,Singin in the Rain has countless times been named the greatest musical ever made and of course there are many reasons for this all of its songs are memorable it features the most iconic songanddance routine in film history and it celebrates talent creativity and imagination  Some of the comic elements in the film may be too sophisticated for children under 10 but the music is universal and the main focus of the film anyway  A loving tribute to Hollywood and its fickleness there are some selfcentred manipulative characters and passionate romantic moments to stay aware of,3
211563,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,Love it love it love it love it love it  Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooove IT,2
211564,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,CSM doesnt always include everything  Did nobody notice that Olgas dressed inappropriatelyShes only shown in two scenes  Also this girl on a poster isnt dressed appropriately  Thats only one 10 second scene  I love Lina Also Don and Kathy kiss 2 times but thats all  Also Lina says 2 insults dope and dumb,8
211773,426번,Smallfoot,7,I think this movie is the best for 5 year olds its not as bad as u think it is,1
211774,426번,Smallfoot,7,Small Foot is just a masterpiece  Its really adorable as well definetly would recommend if your into fictional creatures,3
211775,426번,Smallfoot,7,I thought the music was great and the movie was really cute   I would watch it 3 more times,2
211776,426번,Smallfoot,7,This was a fun family movie The musical numbers were great and it had a very solid storyline  I found it very entertaining and fun,3
211777,426번,Smallfoot,7,It is very funny and interesting and also sad  It is fineso the parents can watch it with there kids,1
211778,426번,Smallfoot,7,I will admit it was better than I expected  Really good for a kids movie funny and cute although a little predictable and silly  Music was soso  In no way did it come off antireligious to me a religious teen  Totally worth the watch for a fun family movie night,5
211779,426번,Smallfoot,7,My 160000000 year old cranked that Zendata managing the data in movies to be less effective  Excuse me I think gothic teens will might be bored P Okay I will capture the Bigfoot in the 1970s instead ZendayaRants,4
211780,426번,Smallfoot,7,An unbelievably great movie a list of laughs a mile long,1
211781,426번,Smallfoot,7,Smallfoot is a good movie that you can watch with friends or family no violence or scary scenes there is about two or three sad parts in it and one part with tranquilizers but aside from that the movie is fun and it will not give any children nightmares the next night hopefully so do not be worried if they say they will be scared if they watch it,1
211948,441번,Song of the Sea,8,Song of the Sea is a beautifully told story  although the film is based around a little boy who is cruel to his sister and some parts include strange creatures that might make younger kids scared it is a great family movie  the animation is incredible and will be very inspiring to young artists,3
211949,441번,Song of the Sea,8,This is a movie that is worth rewatching again and again  I say that it is for ages six and up because anyone younger would not appreciate it but it is appropriate for all ages,2
211950,441번,Song of the Sea,8,I loved this movie  The graphics and story were beautiful  I strongly recommend watching it,3
211951,441번,Song of the Sea,8,its so cute and extremely good just a little creepy though,1
211952,441번,Song of the Sea,8,Violance some mild peril  In the beginning the audience is left to believe that a woman died  A boy gets almost hit by a car but the act is possibly played for laughs  An antagonists animals tries to take a child but is protected by other characters and the characters turns to stone by the animals but the child is safe and leaves  Sexy stuff a wife kisses her husband brief  Profanity Ben makes several religious exclaminations like holy molly and Jesus Maria and Josef feic off is written on a door but i didnt know what it meant and other children would probably not focus on that  Drinkingdrugssmoking Conor drinks at a pub in one scene brief which seems to be a habit for him since grandma said something like where were you drinking at the pub no other reference of pub drinking is made  Personally i think younger kids can watch it for the beautiful animation and soundtrack but the story might go over younger kids heads  But the csms age rating is still understandable  a girl goes down to the sea at night alone and swims in one scene Ben and maybe even Saorises goal is to go from the city back to the lighthouse without supervision for the major part of the movie a characters body slowly changesages the characters hair turns white and the body gets weaker  Overall a lovely movie that i recommend,14
211953,441번,Song of the Sea,8,Okay not to be rude or anything but the Song Of The Sea is a odd movie  The Song Of The Sea is about An Irish youth discovers that his mute sister is a selkie  A half human half seal   Who must find her voice and free supernatural creatures from the spell of a Celtic goddess  So the whole movie is hand drawn which makes all of them look creepy  Then the music is sooo weird  And not to mention the mom abandoned her family to go with the selkie pod It was confusing depressing and just plain weird  I think it might be super popular in Ireland  I just didnt think it was all that good,9
211954,441번,Song of the Sea,8,scary great role  models but its good and you might  need to go past some parts,1
211955,441번,Song of the Sea,8,I think that this movie is very good but is a little sad  I would definitely watch this again  The drawings and sound are incredible  Very good,4
211956,441번,Song of the Sea,8,This movie is really great  It is very complex and I had a hard time understanding the story but the imagery in this movie is unbelievable  I would not recommend this for younger children as the story is very complex and the plot deals with a heavy subject,3
211957,441번,Song of the Sea,8,I liked the Song of the Sea  It was grate and a litel scarey but other than that it was good,2
212091,443번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,In the movie it says hell and almost said son of a b,1
212092,443번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,Its a good movie i dont have anything else to say,1
212093,443번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,This movie has a lot of stuff,1
212094,443번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,The movie was exciting and if you liked sonic or not you would like it a lot it had good mix of scenes and makes the viewer intrigued on the movie and I think it would be for kids 9 but it does have a bit of violence so if you dont like violence you might not like it as much and overall it was a good movie,1
212095,443번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,Plot Sonic is alone on planet earth after fleeing from a tribe that tried to capture him as a child  When the government discovers Sonic they hire Dr  Robotnik Jim Carrey to track him down  Sonic acquires the help of his friend Tom James Marsden to help him get back to his home planet,3
212096,443번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,I liked it  Some unfinished cursing  Quite good,3
212097,443번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,fantastic it had a lot of good things and it was a little good and a little good but if you take one good away it is terrible  Scientificly people think that this movie is good the end,2
212098,443번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,Parents need to know that this film is really good  James Marsden plays a character very similar to his in Hop which could confuse younger viewers  There is a lot of perilaction  In one scene someone drinks  There is lots of positive messages and role models  Some cutoff swearing like son of a  and what the   Lots of consumerism  The whole movie is an avritisement for the video game,8
212553,453번,Spaceballs,6,I found the humor rather boring and bad a lot of random swearing and such  Wouldnt recommend at all but defiantly not for kids under 13,2
212554,453번,Spaceballs,6,There is lots of swear words as well as groin related jokes however if your kids are mature enough to no whats not appropriate and what is as well as if your okay maybe covering your kids eyes in a couple of seams  But other then that its a great movie that well leave you laughing,2
212555,453번,Spaceballs,6,Spaceballs is a 1987 comedy movie directed by Mel Brooks and starring Rick Moranis Bill Pullman Mel Brooks John Candy and Daphne Zuniga,1
212556,453번,Spaceballs,6,This is a decent comedy spoof  It is funny and interesting to see how the original Star Wars characters are portrayed in this parody  The movie has some mild innuendo and a good amount of language including fck once sht and asshole  Its laughoutloud hilarious but its only a 3 star movie,4
212557,453번,Spaceballs,6,this is the best mel brooks move  is is much funny,2
212558,453번,Spaceballs,6,This is a good movie but more for the older audience,1
212559,453번,Spaceballs,6,This spoof on classic sciencefiction movies can be very dumb and wacky but thats what makes it so unique  The humor used throughout has very wacky concepts to it but yet these concepts are very innovative when used and are able to effectively satirize Star Wars Alien and more with successful results,2
212560,453번,Spaceballs,6,Spaceballs is a great Mel Brooks comedy with a laugh in a minute guarantee by all of the comedy lovers,1
212561,453번,Spaceballs,6,Spaceballs is actually the first spoof movie I ever saw and it was very funny and in a creative way  Sure some of the humor is predictable but all of the humor is very creative  Mel Brooks has created humor that NO ONE has ever thought of doing  Like when Dark Helmet accidentally hits a cameraman with his Schwartz it is very creative and hilarious  Mel Brooks Rick Moranis John Candy and Bill Pullman were perfect for their roles and gave me something to laugh at several times throughout the movie  However it gets pretty dirty halfway through,6
212711,460번,Spider-Man 2,8,Before no way home I have decided watching all of the spider man movies  AS I SAJD BEFOFE I BARELY remember this series so I went in this expecting a great experience and it was good,2

212715,460번,Spider-Man 2,8,I watched SpiderMan 2 back when I was probably 4 or 5  I remember the losing powers scene and just how good of a movie it was  But going back to the movie 8 years later just shows how harsh it actually is  Let me give you a brief idea of what I think is harsh in this movie  Let me know what you think,5
212716,460번,Spider-Man 2,8,I love this movie but it is violent and has long kissing scenes,1
212717,460번,Spider-Man 2,8,How is this ok for kids The wife sees a pane of glass hurtling towards her the entire emergency room staff are gutted  We stopped watching when the grandmother was dropped offa building  Not ok for kids,4
212718,460번,Spider-Man 2,8,Wow spider man 2 is the best spider man movie ever it was amazing I watched this movie when I was 7 and I loved it doc ock is a great villain the actors are amazing cgi was great for the time cgi still holds up kinda and I totally recommend this movie but if this is your kids 1st pg13 movie then I would go for spider man homecoming then this movie,1
212719,460번,Spider-Man 2,8,The only scene that you have to worry about is the medic scene its not scary its very violent for young kids and the concept of it is scary,1
212720,460번,Spider-Man 2,8,Not for younger kids but for older kid teens and tweens perfect  SpiderMan 2 is one of my favorite movies,2
212867,461번,Spider-Man 3,8,SpiderMan  3 may not not be the best of the series but it  is still really good and is a enjoyable  actionpacked blockbuster that you wont  wanna miss,1
212868,461번,Spider-Man 3,8,This movie has too much violence  It gave me nightmares  I had a nightmare of a character named Venom  I think this movie should be rated R for intense action violence,4
212869,461번,Spider-Man 3,8,The only reason why this movie gets so much hate is because the critics werent having it  It truly is spectacular how movie critics can sway the popular opinion surrounding a movie as great as SpiderMan 3  After overcoming various obstacles in the previous two movies Peter Parker SpiderMan is in the prime of his life  Hes with the girl of his dreams the city of New York loves him and hes just been given the key to the city  Peter eventually lets his pride get to him and he becomes oblivious to the troubles that those closest to him are facing  This lack of selfawareness leads to the untimely breakup between him and MJ and makes him susceptible to the symbiote suit which latches on to him halfway through the movie  This event gives rise to the black suited SpiderMan and consequently a cockier and even more oblivious emostyled Peter Parker  In exchange for enhanced powers and confidence Peter gives his humanity and kindness which made him who he was in the previous two movies  His newfound ferocious nature leads him to ferociously beatdown on Sandman and after believing that he has killed him Peter returns to his apartment   After a dispute with his beloved landlord Mr  Ditkovich Peter realizes that the black suit is bad for him and promptly puts it away  Mr  Ditkovich then helps Peter out by giving him some advice on how to flirt with MJ which includes the famous lines You are good woman I am good man  From then on the movie becomes all the more actionpacked leading to a thrilling climax at the end where Peter teams up with Harry to fight both Sandman and Venom  Would recommend to all buy this movie and show it to your kids,13
212870,461번,Spider-Man 3,8,SpiderMan 3 is a good movie  Its still a competent addition to the Raimi Trilogy but its undoubtedly the worst in it  I used to really like this movie but upon rewatching it my opinion changed  I still had fun with it but there was a lot of bad parts in the movie probably more so than good parts  The characters seem pretty different from the first two and the story is so rushed that its hard to get invested in this film,5
212871,461번,Spider-Man 3,8,This was personally my favorite of the three spiderman movies its theme was a little more mature than the other two spiderman aka peter parker almost goes evil in one section of the movie and it might be upsetting for kids when harry tries to kill peter in the end  But peter fights the temptation of becoming evil,2
212872,461번,Spider-Man 3,8,Okay great movie  It has three villains Hobgoblin Venom and Sandman  I dont know what they were thinking with including Hobgoblin and Venom  They let Hobgoblin get a good play in the end but Venom No  It was nice to have Venom as a sidevillain but they did a great job with Sandman,6
212873,461번,Spider-Man 3,8,Probably the best of the three this movie is quite a bit more intense than the first two if your kid was a little scared of the first two wait until heshe is 8,1
212874,461번,Spider-Man 3,8,Parents need to know that this is the third film in the SpiderMan franchise  It has lots of violence  Peter has some scary nightmares  Peter is really mean in some scenes and strikes someone he loves  SPOILER ALERT Many important characters die including one character who is a minor villain but a main character as well as a main character from the other two films That one is really sad  Lots of I am going to mary someone else or I will date your girlfriend kind of thing  Good Movie  The evil goo might scare younger viewers,8
212875,461번,Spider-Man 3,8,there is so much stabbing not so much cursing though if a kid under 8 watched it they would get nightmares,1
213288,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,Pros Plot was nice there was a lot of humor and it teaches nice lessons like unity and friendship  Also good animation,2
213289,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,More for younger kids,1
213290,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,Im a very simple girl  I instantly love almost everything at watchread  But this This has gotta be the first piece of media excluding music  that has weirded me out  And even then I rate it 3 stars  Anyways as for anything parents should be concerned about,6
213291,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH His hand shrinks,2
213292,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,When I watched this I expected something funny or sad or something but I got garbage  It has enough potty humor and nude scenes to make a five year old laugh for days  There were no surprises or anything that would shock the viewer so dont waste your time with it,3
213293,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,Theres nothing really inappropriate in spies in disguise  There is a scene with a naked man but you cant see anything to bad  you do see his butt very clearly but besides that theres no bad nudity  There is a normal amount of violence for a animated kids actioncomedy movie   As usual theres gross jokes and humor that will entertain a 58  That pretty much raps up my review the sad thing is that they had so much potential with this movie and they did nothing with it such talented voice actors to really a shame,6
213294,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,Super good it funny and surprising you should watch this your kids will love it,1
213295,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,Fun movie with nice story   Some parents comments are exagerated  This is a nice fun movie to watch,3
213305,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,Spies in Disguise is a great movie  It is a funny movie and a little sad  It is a great adventure story Wilbur is a great role model,4
213306,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,not funny but super funny haha i loved it,1
213307,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,I have seen on here that some parents are leaving reviews of 18 Like really This is such an awesome movie How is it disgusting It has a picked on nerdy kid who saves the day And plus it is unlikely friends that do it together It is a kids movie and the naked parts arent even that bad for you to be covering your kids eyes And those who are saying the boy said Fifty Shades of Yeah how is that bad if I may ask It is not like he is saying Fifty Shades of Grey  There are some dramatic people out there that dont deserve to write reviews on here  It is just made to be funny especially for kids If you say you wasted your money maybe you should have read the reviews and then maybe considered instead of just watching the movie and leaving a horrible an overexaggerated review Very disappointed in some of these reviews ugh,14
213308,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,I love this film I think it should be a TV show,2
213309,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,It was meh Tom Holland is always great but there were moments that were a bit cringe  They had some millennial memes under disguise there was a scene of nudity that was uncomfortable oh god dont get me started on the sumo thing  It just made me and the very very Christian homeschool girl Im friends with super uncomfortable,3
213310,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,Spies in disguise is a great movie in almost every way  Will Smith and Tom Holland knock it out of the park with voice acting it has detailed animation it is hilarious and it might just be one of my favorite movies  Expect some more mature themes though  Lots of violence and people dying not on screen but implied many moments where characters almost swear and there is some drinking  This movie is a must watch please watch it,5
213311,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,I think this movie is very very funny but there is a scary when the guy shows his robot self,1
213312,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,Great movie with lots of jokes  Love the cast not a lot of bad stuff,2
213313,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,best family film ever,1
213314,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,This movie    supercalafragilisticexpialodocious I loved this movie I thought it was just stunning The animation the storyline    But there is violence like kicking punching spy stuff  Mild language such as hell heck and the fword but it is beeped out,7
213315,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,This movie is very   funny,1
213316,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,Great movie with Will Smith and Tom Holland,2
213317,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,This is so awesome,1
213318,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,Scene where some male figure shows nudity  almost to the point of revealing the male gentalia      I was disgusted and couldnt believe the detail in art work that was sexually explicit   The f was bleeped and totally unnecessary  why pretend to use a cuss word as a bleep  it was annoying   just filth in my opinion   The majority of the humor is towards a younger age audience but the scenes I mentioned just took away from the humor and makes this a movie not a great pick for kids    I told my mom not to let my younger siblings watch it,5
213319,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,Although Spies in Disguise is a very comedic movie with great voice actors it has lots of violent scenes that make you say Ouch or Oooo out loud while watching the movie  My parents really enjoyed Spies in Disguise so I guess there are mixed feeling about it but every movie has different people watching it w opinions right If you are looking for a very funny kids spy movie and you dont care about watching some characters battle it out then this movie should be your top pick,5
213320,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,it is hilarious but when there in kamoras apartmant they say hands up and see kamoras butt little kids find it funny though,1
213321,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,I am 14 years old and I watched it with my family and enjoyed it nd laughed  This Animation is suitable for all ages and i totally recommend,2
213322,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,Its very good  its really funny  It has potty humor and has some peril but overall has great messages and roll models,3
213323,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,Parents need to know that this movie is very good,1
213427,465번,Spirited Away,7,i love all the Japanese films from studio ghilbi and this was one of my favorites  the beautiful animation and characters are a masterpiece and the story is amazing  though the movie is beautifully done some scenes are bloody and violent,3
213428,465번,Spirited Away,7,This is a really good movie Its about a girl whos parents are turned into pigs  She tries to find them but there a lot of other things that she has to do  This movie can be creepy but not too creepy  However there are a few scary parts so if you have a child who gets scared easilythis movie might not be great for them,5
213429,465번,Spirited Away,7,i think its a wonderfull movie but maybe a little of a lot of violence,1
213430,465번,Spirited Away,7,Beautiful movie cool story but can be scary when a dragon gets hurt and is bleeding all over the place,1
213431,465번,Spirited Away,7,This is my absolute favorite movie of all time However I would NOT recommend this for children under the age of 10 or children that get creeped out easily  There are several extremely disturbing characters such as No Face a spirit that goes crazy and eats people  His appearance may also be frightening to some viewers  The parents turn into giant pigs at the beginning which could also frighten children  However the 10yearold main character is very brave and goes through lots of solid character development throughout the movie she goes from being bratty and lazy to being brave and kind and the one of the themes that I personally took from the movie was kindness,6
213432,465번,Spirited Away,7,It may be a little bit creepy for younger children but i LOVE IT  There is a few parts like a frog smoking the babys butt is not covered  a boy in dragon form getting attacked by paper birds and bleeding and throwing up blood and almost bleeding to death and a creature named Noface luring people with gold and eating them  I have no idea how 7 year olds could be scared by this  Just make sure that your child is mature enough to not be scared by ghosts and things  Just know that this is 5 stars,5
213433,465번,Spirited Away,7,Yes Princess Mononoke is good Howls moving castle is good  But they do not come close to this film  Spirited away is a great movie  I think ages 10 will really enjoy it   There is nothing bad in it although when No face becomes crazy and starts to eat people that might scare some younger kids but it is not too bad,5
213434,465번,Spirited Away,7,Spirited Away is a beautiful movie one that makes you immediately want to watch it again  The soundtrack is lovely  the characters are all memorable and likable even the bad guys and visually the movie is stunning,2
213435,465번,Spirited Away,7,I am 7 years old and I have watched spirited away  For me it is  6 and up  But I can see how other people may not  like it and be scared of it  SUPER AWSOME AND EXCITING,4
213679,469번,Spy Kids,7,Just the right combination of fantasy and comedy,1
213680,469번,Spy Kids,7,VIOLENCE SCARINESS AND GORE  People are turned into mutant creatures for a kids TV show in the movie  The show also has a lot of fingers designed to look like humans  Might creep kids out  No blood,4
213681,469번,Spy Kids,7,Exciting familyfriendly tale with some violence peril,1
213682,469번,Spy Kids,7,Pretty solid film but there is one scene where the mom of the kids whispers into the dads ear to persuade him  This is a bit sexual,2
213683,469번,Spy Kids,7,This movie is very boring and bad  The sister character is annoying and unlikable  This is one of the most overrated and boring movies Ive ever seen,3
213684,469번,Spy Kids,7,AMAZING film but bewarned of one almost 4 letter word,1
213685,469번,Spy Kids,7,Spy Kids was my favorite movie as a kid and I still love it today  I used to watch it all the time when I was younger  This movie has a lot of great role models  Yes its a little stupid but overall it was very ahead of its time  It has good representation strong female leads Hispanic family a good plot and its enjoyable to watch  I strongly recommend this movie for all ages  Some younger kids could be startled by the fooglies and they could not understand the plot,7
213686,469번,Spy Kids,7,GREAT  Six year olds can really enjoy this amazing film  Even the grown up spies are GREAT  Yeah suitable for six and over,4
213941,473번,Stand by Me,7,THIS WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS  Stand by me is a sweet movie about four 12 year olds go on a quest to search for a dead body  A ton of strong language is used  It is one of my favorite movies  My favorite kid is teddy  I would rather let kids watch this then disney crap  While the boys search another group and up beating the boys to the body   Gordy pulls out a gun  None of the groups take this body  Later the body if found and neither of the groups is given credit  Amazing movie with awesome ,11
213942,473번,Stand by Me,7,This movie follows four best friends going on possibly their last adventure together  There is quite a lot of cussing  But as Wil Wheaton said Parents who think their kids dont cuss are just fooling themselves  This movie is amazing and perfect for growing teens  I would recommend to anyone who cares to see it,5
213943,473번,Stand by Me,7,This is an example of a rating completely baffling me  If this didnt have the F bombs and smoking it would be PG  I actually encourage you to show any kid 6 and up this movie its rated so unfairly  Realistic language that 12 year old boys actually speak I should know  A few kids smoke cigarettes but if your kid has seen someone smoke in real life its no different  Wheres your kid going to get cigarettes anyway A few kids talk about tits again like we actually do in real life  At the end a dead body is seen not too graphic a little blood  The movie has great messages behind it like friendship and loyalty and even just doing the right thing  The main character is a great role model except for the smoking,10
213944,473번,Stand by Me,7,people die and kids do drugs but still one of the best,1
213945,473번,Stand by Me,7,This is a fantastic movie  Ive seen this countless times since I was around 8  I have two younger siblings whom have grown up watching it  While there is plenty of swearing some smoking and it really evolves around a search for a murdered body I really think that the overall message of friendship and loyalty hence the name Stand By Me over powers it all  And yes there are sexual innuendos like most shows and movies these days  They will fly over the younger audiences heads  I really think that if your child has been exposed to any media violence and rough language this movie is fine for them to watch,7
213946,473번,Stand by Me,7,Great movie  I watched it when I was 10 first R rated movie  It has strong lenguge 11f words 110 uses of py 1 use ck possibly 1 use of ct  This also has four 12 year old boys talk about sexual stuff boobsetc eight 18 year old boys talk about getting laid  12 year olds carry around around a 45 caliber  Very intense but still if your kid has played gta4or5 they will love this movie,5
213947,473번,Stand by Me,7,The movie is funny clever depressing adventurous and chilling all at the same time  Dont let the R rating put you away from the film  There is some strong language but there are lots of positive messages of growing up strong with others  A great classic,4
213948,473번,Stand by Me,7,stand by me is a great moviebut has a lot of language and smoking,1
213949,473번,Stand by Me,7,I think this is completely okay for early teens   As far as the language goes thats what 12 and 13 yr olds actually talk like   There are some references to  child abuse both physical and emotional but its not bad at all   Stand By Me is the perfect movie for teens,4
213950,473번,Stand by Me,7,Its a great movie about 4 boys who act older as their adventure goes on Interesting movie about how kids grow up and become teenagers,1
214022,476번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,I didnt think this series could get any better but it does This movie kind of shows up the previous one but the first one sets up nicely for this one,2
214023,476번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,Star Trek Into Darkness is a 2013 scifi movie directed by J  J  Abrams and starring Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Benedict Cumberbatch Alice Eve Simon Pegg and Leonard Nimoy,1
214024,476번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,JJ Abrams is a good director  His best attributes have to be his attention to detail intricacies in characters and intense suspense,2
214025,476번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,Overall this movie is very good  At the discretion of parents I would not allow a kid to watch this movie until they are AT LEAST 14,2
214026,476번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,This film has a lot of violence and is very intense  There is strong punching kick shooting stabbing and more  On one bit a guy crushes a mans head and stamps on a whoman lying on the floor  She then has to go to hospital meaning it was A bad injury  On one fight scene there is very strong violence and a man gets his neck snapped  They are also being continuously punched and being slammed against walls  It is very stressful and intense  There is bad language used very often including bloody bastard bitch shit ass crap damn and more  The language is not as bad as the first one because that one has an F bomb at the beginning  Going back to the violence there is some blood  Whomen are shown in bed topless with men and there is lots of underwear  For mature 10 year olds or 11 year olds  There is great messages and role model as the captain dies to save his crew  Spoiler alert   he comes back to life  Also enemies become friends in the film  There is also drinking at a bar,16
214027,476번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,Omagersh this movie was absolutely terrible The plot was really only for a gasp for the audience  They were more concerned with the gasp than the Wow  That was really interesting Its certainly making me think,5
214028,476번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,Amazing movie  I think the storyline is amazing and the acting is superb  J J Abrams did an amazing job on this film if it even is a little bit violent I think little kids may not like this movie as it is a bit scary for their age group Their is a few st  and a word very close to the Fword  This 2 and a half hour movie is great and definitely worth your time,4
214029,476번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,This was a an excellent second movie It was not disappointing at all There were some creepy parts but they really werent too bad Overall it is a fantastic movie to watch  ,5
214030,476번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,My rating hard PG13 for graphic nudity racy content language and some bloody violence,1
214273,490번,Steve Jobs,8,great,1
214274,490번,Steve Jobs,8,I am a Apple Fan and I honestly love this movie  It tells about how we got the device that we know and love today  However try watching it together if you have a 67 year old as it does contain some language,3
214275,490번,Steve Jobs,8,Why is everyone making a huge deal about the appropriateness of this movie Its literally just swearing  And Ive heard WAY more swearing in other movies  By age 8 Id heard all these words before  Its not like kids will watch this movie and suddenly start cussing At one point Jobs asks his assistant Why havent we slept together which is the only reference to sex in the entire movie,7
214276,490번,Steve Jobs,8,I think the format of this movie is really interesting  When I started to watch it I thought it was going to be like every other biopic but I actually found it very engaging I also think the casting is great especially Michael Fassbender,3
214277,490번,Steve Jobs,8,There is no other film with such perfect timing and dialogue  An overwhelming sense of emotion is tirelessly infused within the script  The acting portrays not just the characters but human stories that all can relate with  The music is a collision much like Jobs of creativity yet also pause  This film is a miracle,5
214278,490번,Steve Jobs,8,A TON OF UNNECESSARY CUSSING Buuuuuut if your kid can handle it its ok  I watched it because my dad worshiped him lol  It was a good educational movie,4
214279,490번,Steve Jobs,8,Michael Fassbenders portrayal and Danny Boyles direction really shine here as both of them show brilliant roles in their part   Aron Sorkins dialogue also is amazing  Also the cinematography is brilliant and was amazing to see that in the first act a 16 mil lens was used than a 18 mil lens in the second act ans then was shot on digital cameras to show the progression of technology,3
214280,490번,Steve Jobs,8,This was a really interesting movie because it  didnt have any plot at all  it was basically just Steve Jobs launching three different products with no flashbacks showing you his past life or careers at all  Whether youre intrigued or utterly confused at that type of filmmaking is a matter of personal opinion  However what is NOT a matter of personal opinion is the frequent usage of strong language such as fk st ahole and the like  Also something that CSM didnt cover which is part of the reason Im writing this review is that a Time magazine interview in which Steve Jobs joked that 28 of American men slept with his wife and therefore produced his daughter which later comes back at him is referenced a lot especially towards the beginning  Overall the film isnt that bad contentwise especially for an Rrated movie and is appropriate for teens to see if it holds their interest that is  My MPAA rating R for language,7
214281,490번,Steve Jobs,8,Though this is my favorite movie The Language has some dmns,1
214962,531번,Tarzan,6,Well honestly this seems a perfect movie for a five year old  For a G movie its violent for little ones because,2
214963,531번,Tarzan,6,I was really dissapointed  Women shouldnt be showing of their elbows all the time  Its disgusting  A woman should be modest  My 10 year old son couldnt stop ogling those elbows  It was awful,6
214964,531번,Tarzan,6,It is rated G and a great movie,1
214965,531번,Tarzan,6,This movie is kind of good  Kids will love this Disneycartoon movie  This movie is kind of funny and has humor  Though this movie is kind of intense  Shooting is involve  There is some brief cruleness  Mild sex is involve,7
214966,531번,Tarzan,6,Good example of a golden age Disney movie,1
214967,531번,Tarzan,6,I just want to say there is SO much death in this movie First Tarzans parents are unceremoniously eaten by a leopard within the first five minutes and you can see bloody pawprints surrounding them  Then a little baby gorilla is out with his family and he chases a butterfly away from his parents  Were all thinking Aww what a little cutie maybe this will be a sweet movie after all And then the leopard comes  The father gorilla knows they wont be able to save the baby so he holds the mother gorilla back  The poor little baby gorilla is eaten by the leopard offscreen but you can still hear the poor thing screaming in pain and the mother gorilla just hides her face against her husbandmate and cries  Then at the end of the movie the alpha gorilla is shot and killed leaving poor Tarzan heartbroken but in charge of the gorilla troop  And then in the worst Disney death EVER the hunter guy gah I cant remember his name    gets tangled in vines and tries to cut himself free  Little does he know there is a vine entwined around his neck and he basically hangs himself by mistake  You see him plummeting and screaming and then the screen pans to Tarzans shocked face  Then a convenient little flash of lightning illuminates the villains dead body  I know that villains should be punished but that seems a bit far dont you think ANYWAYS the reason I gave three stars instead of one is that the plotline of Tarzan learning how to be human is really sweet and funny  Also I love the music especially Trashing the Camp EARWORM ALERT So if your kids can handle the gore and death I think this is a pretty good movie  Still I wish that not as many characters died  That kind of ruined it for me as I am very sensitive about that kind of thing   Im not saying I hate this movie  In fact I think its pretty good  I just get kind of upset whenever anyone dies  P S Watch Trashin the camp  Look at that teapot  ITS MRS  POTTS I freaked when I saw that  LOL,26
214968,531번,Tarzan,6,This movie is very frightening but older kids 10 to 12 year olds will love it  In one scene Tarzan cuts open a leopard and Kerchacks death is very sad  There are some good messages like that characters can fit in even when they are from different places   Though most of the good messages are blocked out by guns there are still a few more like that you may get injured when saving your friends but it is worth it   Clayton is very scary   His actions involve killing a few gorillas   His death is very violent   Overall it is a good movie for tweens,8
215041,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,I saw the premiere at the beach then my sister watched over and over again it was a movie about Mack Maia Mitchell and Brady Ross Lynch I thought fallin for you was pretty catchy but I hated the rest of the movie I couldnt get past 30 minutes dont bother with this movie watch High School Musical if you like musicals and Disney channel,1
215042,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,I personally thought this movie was cute fun and enjoyable I really dont see how it can be considered inappropriate in any way there isnt even any kissing  The romance between Brady and Mac is so subtle that I didnt even realize that they were more than friends until they mentioned a possible breakup  And for the people complaining about the revealing swimwear they are at the beach What do you want them to wear full bodysuits The bathing suits are 60s fashion so I honestly think they are a lot more modest looking than current ones are and you can see nude colored material at certain points that the actresses are wearing under their costumes so nothing is revealed  For the love of god your child isnt going to become a sexcrazed demon because they saw a girls stomach  As for the plot itself there are definitely plot holes but none that really take away from the film  The whole mad scientist bit was just dumb and unnecessary and I think everyone else can agree with that as well  The cast was pretty good I dont really care that much for ross lynch I felt like I was watching the same exact character from Austin and Ally  Everyone else was great though There are tons of positive messages cliche ones like follow your dream and ones I was pleasantly surprised by there is more to life than trying to attract boys  The musical numbers were fun and catchy overplayed a bit in commercials but that shouldnt be a surprise  Overall I really think this movie is safe for young ones and fun for older kids too my brother is 10 and loves it,14
215043,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,This movie never appealed to me at all especially being an eleven yr  Old  The charachter cast and meager confusing storyline makes for a performance that is far below disneys usual standards,2
215044,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,This movie was HORRIBLE  It was corny and had no real humor  Love was basically directing this whole film if you know what I mean  But the cheesy kind of love  Just kissing and all that  It was just so bad,6
215045,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,It has a positive idea but is probably too childish for anyone over ten,1
215046,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,People keep saying that the movie is very inappropriatethey dont curse once there is no product placement and there is a great message  I mean sure there are bikinis and guys with their shirts off but do you want to take your family to the beach Well thats what youre gonna see  Kids arent gonna say I wanna be like Brady and take their shirts off  If you think kids are like sponges know that sponges dont take their shirts off,5
215047,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,This movie is terrible it has a bad soundtrack and a horrible story plot  so I go down in a wave and come back up in a 1950s movie seems pretty fun to me  NOT I would rather watch Baby Einstein for the rest of my life then Watch this movie again even though I only saw 30 minutes of it,4
215048,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,this is a dumb movie firstthis movie is so not about 60s n everything seems like now a lot of girl dress inapropriettall bootsshortsbikinis this movie is trying to make 60s look really modern and similar to todaybut its not like that watch west side story that movie talks about racisam n another social problems in the 60s and 70s i think kids need to know the truth about the 60s and disney always makes thing look betterherculessleeping beauty and another lies,1
215049,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,No matter what its about awesome movie ,2
215050,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,This is a great movie for kids all the way up to teens   I watched this movie with my mom and she LOVED it   It is a movie I would definitely recommend for all ages,3
215392,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,The whirlwind animated adventure is a visual treat for tweens,1
215393,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,The Adventures of  Tintin has lots of adventure you guessed it and violence with pirates fighting some blood and lots of guns  Also the story is nice and ambiguous  Some may love this however what brings the movie rating down for me is that some scenes were too unreal and their was too much drinking  Once a pirate captain got directly hit by lightning but he was completely fine afterwards  Also the main character had been chased by pirates with guns at least ten times but did not get hit The worst part was probably where the drinking So much and even the dog got drunk This is way to unrealistic  Did I mention the dog is as smart as a human and seems to understand english,9
215394,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,Unless you are prepared to deal with nightmares or acts of pretend violence this movie is for you,1
215395,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,This movie is really fun I like it Its just a nice adventure movie to watch if you dont want to watch something emotional  TINTIN MY BELOVED   Great movie,5
215396,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,It is a good movie but they could have done it a little more entertaining,1
215397,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,this movie is great but there are tons of guns haddock is obsessed with alcohol and the blood on the newspaper seems really realistic for CGI,1
215398,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,I remember watching this for the first time back 2011 and being absolutely blown away by the visuals  The writing was a lot more mature but fun,2
215399,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,This is actually my favorite moviethough I am bit biased due to the fact that it was my childhood movie My parents didnt know that it was a more mature movie and brought me a long when I was 3   the action and violence flew over my head and I didnt really know what was happening  Though I was not scared by it I dont recommend that age After I grew older and learned to appreciate this movie I came to love it   I found the books and it made the movie even more of a treat  Tintin is a great role model and is the best Captain Haddocks drinking problem can not be ignored though  If you show it to kids you might want to inform about that and tell them it is bad  And if there is a child in the room you might want to tell them to close their eyes when the man is shot with a machine gun  Other than that the violence is mild with a few punches and missed gun shots,10
215400,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,This is pretty much appropriate for all ages as long as you skip through the violent scenes,1
215478,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,I say the violence only tentatively  Men get shot stabbed yet blood is only seen once  Most people hold gunsfire weapons  Haddock goes quite crazy after drinking and he drinks a lot  Tintin is quite intelligent resourceful and tough  Thompson and Thompson are humorous in that they are slightly reminiscent of the three stooges  An interesting point is that only one woman is seen in the whole movie  She is only secondary however  Also a startling point is that no children are present whatsoever  Tintin may look young but that premonition is quickly blown away,10
215479,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,I saw this movie when it came out in 3D this movie kept my intrest in this movie but my mom was kind of bored in some parts  so take your kids to see this movie it like indiana jones met pirates of the caribbean,2
215480,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,Like my title the books were way better trust me I know I have them all even the ones not released in the US like Tintin in the Congo  The movie is still good and is a must see for any Tintin fan  The Rating is PG which is solid but it is leaning to PG13 there is a man who gets shot partway into the movie and it shows him falling to the ground with some blood  Drinking is also a main theme in the movie but the positive rollmodels and the messages in the movie more then make up for the bad things age wise  This is a movie almost any age could see if they didnt mind some violence and a little blood  The humor is great  All in all a great movie for anyone,7
215481,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,When Nickelodeon Productions popped out of no where with the hit movie Rango I was baffled  It had a great mystery plot and best of all excellent CGI graphics  I loved it,3
215482,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,Steven Spielbergs long awaited and hotly anticipated new holiday movie One of two the other being War Horse which I have yet to see myself The adventures of Tintin is for all of the rave reviews and huge foreign and worldwide box office success and the long year of hype and anticipation thrown at Spielbergs feet it is just absolutely heartbreaking for me to report that I was greatly disappointing  And to add I have been a lifelong fan of the original Herge comics so I am not exactly very new to the whole Tintin franchise in the first place Tintin is very nice looking in fact it quiet possibly and very easily has by far the best use of motioncapture animation and computer animation technology that I have ever seen in any movie thus far  But that is the only good thing bout it  Tintin is a lifeless extremely long and almost interminably dull movie that quit on the viewer long before it even gets to its depressing futile ending  It appears that the magic of Spielbergs movies have been absent from his films for some six or seven years now  Here just hoping that War Horse still has some of that left in it  But despite being Rated PG and being marketed heavily and almost completely towards children The Adventures of Tintin is certainly not for young kidsThere is infrequent but very intense and brutal for an animated movie cartoon violence with several rather harsh deaths and scenes which actually also have quiet of bit of animated blood  Also there is constant nonstop drinking and alcohol use and consumption in the form of the sidecharacter of Captain Haddock who is a great drunk  Finally there is extremely infrequent mild language with only one use of real profanity in the entire movie with that being in the form of dmn  So if you did like many people did happen to like it than great  I just wish it could have been much better than it unfortunately and depressingly was,11
215483,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,The adventures of Tintin is great movie to see with family friends or by yourself  The main character is a young reporter who unknowingly falls into an adventure that takes him around the world  Tintin is well meaning and wants to help most people but also fights when he has to  I dont think many people noticed but there arent that many female characters but that doesnt hold it back  It is violent at sometimes one character getting machine gunned to death but thats the most violence  One character is usually drunk and people dont like it but he overcomes his alcoholism,6
215484,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,Great animation  My rating Intense action crude humor drinking and a murder,2
215485,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,The movie was very violent lots of gun fights dark and confusing for children   My 8yearold daughter laughed out loud a few times but she didnt understand the story  the pace was fast the vocabulary was often over her head and the allusions obscure,2
215486,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,This movie is definitely familyfriendly but as a 13yearold I was seriously disappointed  It went on too long and there were only 2 laughoutloud moments in the entire movie  It didnt really capture my attention because the storyline was hard to follow  I eventually got it but it was just confusing  My personal opinion is that this movie was boring and would definitely be enjoyed more by younger kids,5
215487,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,We run a pretty conservative household and I took my 4year old daughter and 6year old son   Bear in mind we have almost no computer time yet for them and very little TV    so our bar for acceptable media is pretty high   I was a little concerned some of the content could be scary for my daughter so we discussed in advance    Both kids just loved the movie  it was not scary to either of them and the violence was completely antiseptic in my view and not inappropriate at all   Believe me theres nothing appealing about Capt  Haddocks drinking  its a lot more likely to push kids away from a drink than towards it   Simply wonderful movie,7
215517,564번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,The Amazing SpiderMan 2 may have a bit of mistakes but this was my absolute favorite I think what interested me was the SpiderMan costume because it looked exactly like the same suit in the comics  This movie has been AMAZING for me Andrew Garfield is awesome at SpiderMan and Emma Stone is great at acting as Gwen Stacy,4
215518,564번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,Some good messages Think with great power comes great responsibility But sadly consumerism  With AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 costumes to hats to MARVEL SELECT toys  Do not forget McDonalds was a thing in this production BTW Andrew was my fave but now i am SUCH THE FAN of Tom Holland and even got a morphsuit of Tom Hollands Spidey suit,3
215519,564번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,Not Really Violent Not really Sexual but lots of Consumerism  The Plot is very Clunky but overall Parents i guess its okay to let your kids watch this,2

215521,564번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,This movie isnt that good  It has 3 villains and a bunch of plot holes that are confusing  Overall just dont watch it  There are better spider man movies out there  As a huge spider man fan myself I feel a bit disappointed,5
215522,564번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,This is one of the worst movies Ive ever seen  Violence includes deaths of characters disease electric shots out of hands gun shots action destruction and bombs  SpiderMan is a really bad role model and is mean to others  This movie scarred history forever,4
215523,564번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,Andrew Garfield stars as SpiderMan in this sloppy forgettable SpiderMan movie  The plot is confusing Electro is a villain because he has no friends and Peter Parker is a jerk to multiple people  Expect lots and lots of violence and kissing in the movie that tarnished the name of SpiderMan,3
215524,564번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,This movie is GREAT But this is important   In terms of language I heard multiple use of goddamn and damn about 3 uses of ass  5 hell and 1 Holy st  Violence includes neck snapping explosions gunfire falling from heights and choking  Overall good movie but watch it with your kids,4
215525,564번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,i dont know why critics are calling this the worst spiderman film this had a 52 on rotten tomatoes and guess what spiderman 3 had a 63 honestly critics these days  But listen to me instead this is actually really fun so skip spiderman 3 and watch this,3

215706,565번,The Amazing Spider-Man,8,As for why they made a reboot I am not sure as Spiderman 3 was fantastic but as for the reboot there is lots of coming book violence but the new Peter Parker is a very positive role model for young kids,1
215707,565번,The Amazing Spider-Man,8,Its the same SpiderMan story with a different twist   Peters girlfriends father is a police chief and the villain is Peters mentor   I enjoyed it even more than the first Andrew Garfield is cute and dorky and his girlfriend Emma Stone plays your notsotypical blonde   Overall charming and a mustsee for Marvel nerds,4

216172,585번,The BFG,8,Its okay overall there are some scenes of scares and mild violence,1
216173,585번,The BFG,8,Youre going to think I am crazy for saying 9 and 2 stars but I watched this when I was what 7 or 8 and I didnt like it  It was scary sometimes and boring all the other times  I made it through the whole movie finally when I was 8 or 9 but I wasnt paying attention because it was SO BORING  UGH,5
216174,585번,The BFG,8,I love the book for this movie just as much,1
216175,585번,The BFG,8,Of course I love anything Roald Dahl inspired  The BFG is funny lighthearted and has the beautiful message of believing in yourself even if you feel small  Beware small children may be scared on the bigger giants who steal children from their beds and eat them,3
216176,585번,The BFG,8,I love this movie especially when the Queens corgis go flying round and up the house,1
216177,585번,The BFG,8,i read this book at school when i was 10 and i saw the movie when i ws seven years old this is an amazing book to read to kids and it is very entertaining,1
216178,585번,The BFG,8,Boring and Confusing  This movie is so confusing only 11 would know whats going on  NOT A FAN,3
216179,585번,The BFG,8,my mom thought the giants were a little bit scary but from my point of view it was a non scary silly adventurous movie,1
216190,585번,The BFG,7,Its a great variation of the book  It has a bit of toilet humour but kids will love it A bit of scariness but not that much  I loved the slimy vegetables All in all it was pretty good,5
216191,585번,The BFG,7,A bit boring but some bits can be funny the giant is well made and it seems real the acting rolls are not to bad depending on the scene,1
216192,585번,The BFG,7,The movie is a great idea its perfect for children and even people who enjoy movies such as this its nothing like any other giant movie i hope youll like it as much as i did,1
216193,585번,The BFG,7,This movie is amazing They just dont make movies like this anymore where it can be entertaining without cursing or inappropriate content  Pros funny no cussing animation is breathtaking plus the storyline is interesting for all ages  Cons a whole scene is dedicated to fart jokes but it was pretty funny though violence that can scare small children but besides that its a great movie,4
216194,585번,The BFG,7,For me the movie was positively boring and not very exciting  For my mom and dad they thought it was great  It definitely was not what I expected based on the trailers however it has great heart and a positive message  Personally I would not recommend it especially for younger kids  I think younger kids would find it too thoughtprovoking and a bit too slow and lack of magic,5
216195,585번,The BFG,7,the BFG was a very good movie If you have toddlers or 6 and below kids I prefer not to watch with them But otherwise sureAt times it can be dark or scary At others they teach you lessons or it can be funny,1
216196,585번,The BFG,7,The BFG brings back to film industry to Steven Spielberg with a genuine work aimed at adults and infants that covets to has the same impact than the previous classics of the director nevertheless his film does not capture such pleasures,1
216197,585번,The BFG,7,This is a lovely movie for families  Some scenes might scare young children under 7  It was a bit boring but very good  Worth seeing it,5
216711,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,Epic sequel has tons of actionviolence,1
216712,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,This is a great sequel and has a great plot but it is violent  There is also some swearing such as one use of fcking and a few uses of st dan and as,2
216713,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,The Bourne Supremacy  yeah its not brilliant in my opinion but its still a good action sequel and better than Identity with more action scenes but hopefully Ultimatum will be even better  There are some violent brutal scenes although not much blood and an Fword so Id recommend this for ages 13 and up  Not bad  An improvement on the soso first film,4
216714,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,This movie is pretty good  Its the second Bourne movie and I enjoyed it a lot,2
216715,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,The Bourne Supremacy improves from the previous movie by doubling up the thrills action and fun to make an even better sequel  This movie does have tons and tons of violence but same as its first movie it is fine for older Tweens and up,2
216716,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,Language 4 510  Violence 810  Sexy Content 010,1
216717,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,This movie is brilliant  It is the second movie in the Bourne series  It is wellacted but pretty violent  Bourne is an easy model to root for although he beats up and kills potential assassins and injures innocent bystanders in a heartstopping car chase  One man shoots himself but we are spared the full gore  Another man gets stabbed by a fellow agent  Jason fights another man which ends up with strangulation  Jasons girlfriend is shot by an assassins bullet meant for him,8
216718,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,This is a pretty good movie with a hell lot of violence blood and killing  The language son of a b is normal,2
216719,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,The Bourne Supremacy is as outstanding as the first  With hard intense action which has my favorite scene in the film the fight is the house  It was gripping and realistic since there was no music in the background until it was over an excellent continuation of the story great acting from Damon and new additions Joan Allen Brian Cox and Karl Urban and John Powells score is great  Grade A,4
216720,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,My ratingR for strong violence some racy content alcohol use and language throughout,1
217139,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,I watched this with my 12 year old cousin and he was fine the blood and gore is over the top but it is by unrealistic monsters it is a great film if you can handle blood,1
217140,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,Okay first of all I wanted to see this movie really badly  So I saw it  I hate this movie  I dont like movies when literally the whole thing is gallons and gallons of blood is just spurting out everywhere every 5 seconds  This movie is so stupid dont even think about wasting money to see this  Its pointless with pretty much no plot,6
217141,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,Cabin in the Woods doesnt go for the easy horror movie laughs that the Scary Movie franchise tries to elicit but it is a curiously interesting satire on why horror movies can be so cliched and ridiculous at times  The movie itself isnt too scary save for a few jump scares but its wit keeps it afloat and distinguishes it among other lesser flicks,2
217142,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,Cabin In The Woods had a great concept but I felt overall the actual movie was very weak and bland  Now on to the parents guide  I watched this movie knowing that it would have gore and language but I didnt know how gory this movie would be  It was pretty bad the first part of the film but about the last thirty minutes of the film it is a total gore fest  There was one scene where in about two minutes in one room monsters escape and grisly kill the men in the room and blood shoots on the roof and on the wall and floor and people are ripped in half and dismembered and decapitated and eaten all in one room the violence made me shiver and one of my favorite movies are kill bill so strongly caution with 14  there  is also one scene of nudity and tons of drugs and language,5
217143,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,As the title said Cabin in the Woods is very dark  It can be very disturbing at points to  It was very well written though and it has a lot of humor  I enjoyed it a lot  It is a very good new take on the horror genre,5
217144,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,The Cabin in the Woods adds new ideas to the horror genre which is falling apart it is visually stunning not that scary but the violence language sex and drinking makes it not recommended for under 15 this age specifically because it is more funny than scary but it has a lot,1
217145,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,I really enjoyed this movie and thought it was clever  I didnt like the drug use and sexuality in the movie there wasnt too too much but there was enough and I think the movie would have been better without it  The main thing about this movie is it is very gory and not good for kids and if your sondaughter can handle lots of blood and scary monsters its fine  If not then do not let them watch this it is very VERY gory,4
217146,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,I am not at all a fan of horror movies but I loved this movie  Its hilarious interesting and refreshingly original  I was 16 when I saw this and had no problems with it but wouldnt recommend it to anyone much younger than that,3
217147,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,The Cabin in the Woods definitely has a witty screenplay and is a smart horror comedy  It features excellent direction and some decent acting  Very original and unique but pause for kids fifteen and under  The film has some sexual contentnudity heavy language some smoking and drug use from a certain character and a large amount of violence  A,5
217148,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,this movie scares me to death  i dont wanna watch itnot only that it is really scarybutit has innapropriate languageand i dont like itand theres drugs in it and i heard that drugs will make you really sicki hate this movie i wish movies like this were never invented,4
217228,627번,The Cat Returns,7,I like a lot of Studio Ghibli movies but OMG this is the best The animation is so cute and like everyone else I fell in love with Baron Humbert von Gikkingen  Hes so dashing and handsome  Its  a short but sweet film and one of my top recommendations,4
217229,627번,The Cat Returns,7,OMG best Ghibli film ever  I loved all the characters and everything was adorable  To be honest I fell in love with the baron  In my opinion best anime film ever,5
217230,627번,The Cat Returns,7,This film was was extremely easy to watch and follow with the storyline being typical of a normal movie  I do just think that this is just a nice kidsfamily movie that you wont have any problems with  The Baron to me is a bit like Sherlock Holmes with his British accent and mannerisms the only thing I was a bit disappointed about was that the plot from Whisper of the Heartthe movie that The Cat Returns is a spinoff of isnt picked up with his missing girlfriend which is a shame  But if you havent watched the previous film then you dont need to worry about that also you dont need to have watched Whisper of the Heart to watch this film there isnt all that much that connects them  I liked the protagonist Haru she did have her assertive moments but then there were also moments where I felt like she was the damsel in distress which I thought went a bit against her character   This movie is suitable for everyone it has nothing upsetting or inappropriate in it and I could imagine myself liking it from as young as when I was in nursery  Overall this is just a heartwarming movie that to me is nothing all that original or differenthence the three star rating but would definitely be a nice one for kids or families to watch as a short fun film,7
217231,627번,The Cat Returns,7,The Cat Returns is a very interesting movie The cats in my opinion are a little creepy but later in the movie I got used to them It has romance in it  which I didnt like Some cats get thrown out windows which is a little scary One of the main characters almost died and that also scared me But overall the movie is really funny and a good family movie,1
217232,627번,The Cat Returns,7,The Cat Returns deserves five stars for its quirky characters cute cats and its theme  The main theme was definitely hidden and I found it  I noticed the characters seem to depend on if someone is cool or not  Haru the main character starts the movie with being late and gets in trouble  She is walking home from school and sees a cat in the street and a big truck is going towards the cat and Haru saves him with her lacrosse stick  Will Haru regret this decision when she finds out who she saved Will she regret listening to the whisper from above And will she regret Calling another cat Moota fat,8
217233,627번,The Cat Returns,7,This is another lovely masterpiece from Ghibli This visually pleasing story about a girl who is swept away to the kingdom of cats after rescuing their prince is a hilarious adorable film that I would definitely recommend   Although there is a slight amount of adult humor that will go over kids heads it is one of the cutest and most memorable films of the genre  10 is quite extreme,4
217234,627번,The Cat Returns,7,While The Cat Returns is Studio Ghiblis shortest feature film to date 11 mins shorter than My Neighbor Totoro its worth a watch if you like humour excitement and talking cats  ADVISORY Not much scariness or violence two cats have a short sword duel with no notable injuries the lower half of a tower is blown but the upper half doesnt collapse and noone on top or ground is hurt two cats are thrown out of a window but they are not seen getting hurt  Little to no swearing a character confesses she has a crush and the main storyline is about the main character being forced to marry a cat but there is absolutely no sex in the movie cats are seen drinking something in a feast but its not stated to be alcohol  The main positive message is about believing in yourself and accepting yourself as who you are  REVIEW This lesser known Studio Ghibli film surprised me positively with its lightness humour and simple but beautiful animation style  The characters are well done from Harus insecure awkwardness to the Barons gentleman calmness and Mutas flippant streetmans speech   While The Cat Returns lacks the high stakes breathtaking art and long running time of other Ghibli films sometimes its just relaxing to forget the world around you for little over an hour and dive into the magical nonsense of the Kingdom of Cats,7
217235,627번,The Cat Returns,7,This films style is ridiculous and hilarious  It is about a teenage girl named Haru who saves a cat who then talked to her   She is then introduced by a bunch of talking cats to the Cat Kingdom  Along the way she meets a living crow statue and living humanoid cat mannequin  The movie is laughoutloud hilarious throughout  I could probably watch it again and again  Its hilarious because of the ridiculousness of the situations from talking cats showering Haru with gifts that only cats like and wanting Haru to marry the cat prince just for saving one of their cats and the dialogue that the cats engage in with Haru and each other  Its like My Neighbor Totoro with a lot of unintentional humor of the sobaditsgood type but it also has lots of intentional humor which is all good as well  The way they did the English dub wasnt half bad  It actually sounded like the way people would speak in English  The visual style was good too looking colorful the outlines being thin and the characters looking almost realistic  The storys plot wasnt too complex but it was still good  I was able to identify a clear threeact structure but it was fast paced and always funny  The characters are good  Theres the grumpy fat cat Muta the outofhismind Cat King the fish out of water Haru and many others  The story is good but the real standout is the humor  You have to see this movie to believe how good it is  One last thing Why is this movie called The Cat Returns When was the first time the cat came But thats just the title not the movie itself  Why did Common Sense give this movie a 10 rating Its perfectly fine for kids,22
217236,627번,The Cat Returns,7,The cat returns is a fantasy adventure film in the classic studio ghibli mold  It has great characters and has a positive message about believing in yourself and helping others  There is some fantasy violence and mild peril but nothing too scary  If you like cats youll love this film,4
217237,627번,The Cat Returns,7,The Cat Returns is a heartwarming epic adventure  There is a little bit of fighting a few cats are thrown out a window and muta  is shown stuck in a big bowl of catnip jelly  Haru talks about a crush on a boy and falls in love with Baron  Language is not a problem just some words like idiot and fatso,4

217636,643번,The Croods,6,Its my favorite movie in the whole entire universe  I love it the most  I think its funny,3
218448,684번,The Founder,8,At first I really despised the ending  The ending showed how if you have perserverance you can crush other peoples dreams  I didnt like that because I thought they were celebrating it  But if you look at it like a cautionary tale its a mighty fun ride,4
218449,684번,The Founder,8,I personally really liked this movie although it had words like F   KS   T and ass it had a strong message of persevere  and love,1
218450,684번,The Founder,8,The movie The Founder is a very well made film about the coming of McDonalds  It is not the most charming story as the main character steals ideas and breaks contracts to get ahead and beat other people  Although it displays a message that you can do anything you can dream of at any age,3
218451,684번,The Founder,8,Howit starts put as ray just selling his invention to him becoming more of a villian in the movie  He divorces his wife and puts the original mcdonalda out of business  Definitely puts a different eye on why not to go to mc donalds ontop of that its fake and unhealthy foods,3
218452,684번,The Founder,8,I really enjoyed this movie  Though somewhat selfish and not a great role model Ray Kroc does show tremendous work ethic and perseverance and keeps fighting for his vision until it is realized  Overall the movie highlights the importance of hard work and never giving up,3
218453,684번,The Founder,8,The reviews call it an ad for McDonalds not at all This movie shows the story of the founder of McDonalds a sleazy dirtbag who stole the company from the real founders and screwed them over in the process  SPOILERS,3
218454,684번,The Founder,8,This is a real story about a guy that owns McDonalds,1

218757,696번,The Good Dinosaur,7,Admiring dino learns positive messages,1
218758,696번,The Good Dinosaur,7,BOO It was very boring dark and depressing nothing like the original Pixar movies  Arlo is a Wimp whining and asking his parents permission for every little thing  Spot cant Hulk out  Thunderclap is the worst villain ever  And the only thing that he loved was himself so throwing Arlos dad off a cliff to a river would do nothing  This scene is stolen from Mufasas death  You do not throw some one you truly love off a cliff It was and remains to this very day the worst movie I have ever seen  The only good part was the end,10
218759,696번,The Good Dinosaur,7,Scared the snot out of me when I was little I would leave the room during the pterodactyls part  Scared me so bad  I literally would start crying when one of my family members put on this  movie,3

218761,696번,The Good Dinosaur,7,Ive never watched this movie but this is my least favorite Pixar movie It is boring childish emotional and a waste of time Maybe little kids are probably like it and teens are probably get bored  Okay the scene of Arlos dad dying stolen from Mufasas death in The Lion King The plot which is not good at all The pterodactyl IDR what is name was is a weakest Pixar villain ever And Arlo is quite not a good role model  Hes probably arrogant and annoying as possible  He was in the second place for the least good Pixar hero first being Merida  I only like is the animation because its beautiful releastic and its quite topnotch but this movie is trash And Spot which is a likable character  I really painful to look at is Arlo and Spot getting drunk  Its so weird I only watched this scene  When I was 9 saw the good Dinosaur for the first time merchandises and commercial I quite dont like it because its boring  Dont watch this movie because it is a waste of time and this Pixar movie is so unlikeable If you liked The Good Dinosaur your opinion will be respect so I understand  Edit For response to my supporter Dogcat  Thank you I really appreciate that you reviewed WALLE But youve never watched this  You saw this movie a little bit in elementary school but not remembered anything that much  I remembered this movie when I was a toddler seeing an advertisement in the theater but I thought it was childish  At 9 I only watched this scene of WALLE and EVE dancing in space  I thought EVE is a boy and a best friend and I dont know what her name is  I mistaken that EVE is WALLEs girlfriend Now since 13 I love it Not childish anymore Its awesome family film WALLE is one of my favorite Pixar movies ever and Im a fan I know all of the scenes I think youve never watched all of Pixar movies except Finding Dory Cars 3 and Inside Out  I think these movies youve never watched Up WALLE like you said before Finding Nemo Monsters Inc and amp Monsters University Toy Story movies A Bugs Life Coco The Incredibles Nadia Clouds favorite Pixar movie Ratatouille Brave Cars 1 and 2 and Soul  I would like to let me know if you watched or never watched these Pixar movies And have seen these movies before but never watched these  Thank you See ya ,38
218762,696번,The Good Dinosaur,7,a lot of you said this movie was sad or scary but I was 8 when I saw this and I was so bored  I knew what death is and all that but I was so bored I couldnt focus on the violent parts or the story  Now that Im 13 contrary to what the bottom of my review might say I might rewatch this movie and possibly be able to focus on the story  If you or your kid friend parent or whoever wanted to see this film out of curiosity in terms of the trailer I would not reccomend watching this  This is kind of offtopic but I had the same reaction to big hero 6 but I was 6 at the time and like I said my reaction was same but I whined and complained things like waa and mommy Im not having fun  I didnt know boredom is a word And that movie might be better if there was a better explanation on what was going on to the kids  btw I did not understand what death is at age 6,6
218763,696번,The Good Dinosaur,7,I saw this when I was seven  I adored dinosaurs so I was like Oh my goodness a dinosaur movie thats animated I need to see this So when we went on a holiday to Perth to see some of my family I thought that would be a perfect time it was still in cinemas So we booked in a time and then we arrived  Long story short I was slightly sick at the time so a lot more emotional  I pretty much never cry at movies and I didnt usually even way back then so yes you know where this is going I CRYED THROUGH THE LITERAL WHOLE ENTIRE MOVIE LITERALLY EVERY SCENE WAS DARK AND DEPRESSING AND IT DIDNT EVEN HAVE A HAPPY ENDING,7
218764,696번,The Good Dinosaur,7,Well all and all this is a great movie to watch with your family   There are a couple scenes that are sad like a scene where he loses his dad in a flood  And in one scene a character rips a cute bugs head off  soo l would make this a pretty good movie,4
218908,699번,The Goonies,6,I personally love this movie  Its one of the first 80s movies I saw and its very funny and the characters grow on you,2
218909,699번,The Goonies,6,This movie is a bit scary but not terryifiying my 6 your old brother was a bit scared but liked it I rate this movie 7,1
218910,699번,The Goonies,6,Great movie ok for tweens though there is a lot of bad language but it is funny but also is action becuase a boy is on a hunt for one eyed willies treasure a few scares though there are some good messages and is a fun family movie,1
218911,699번,The Goonies,6,This film is a must see 80s classic the humour the thrills the iconic quotes  this film has it all made mostly for kids though there is some language and scary scenes,1
218912,699번,The Goonies,6,I wanted this film when I was 11 and I was in Secondary school  I already know every word that they said and I understood everything  A character does pretend to hang himself in the beginning but nothing really happened  One of the main characters does trick a lady who isnt English that the family keep drugs and she will be locked up with cockroaches with no food or water but nothing happens And there is a bit of swearing and a statues penis gets broken and they try to glue it back on But the film shows friendship and loyalty to each other  It shows you cant get by in life if you dont have people looking out for you  Even if they annoy you all the time,6
218913,699번,The Goonies,6,Great movie with great messages and role models I bit of swearing some kissing and one scene with a naked statue the criminals smoke a little and scary at some times,2
218914,699번,The Goonies,6,its ok,1
218915,699번,The Goonies,6,halarius and some language,1
218916,699번,The Goonies,6,I watched this movie when I was about 8  I was an absolute wuss so Sloth is the only thing that scared me  Obviously it was made in the 80s so it should be rated PG13 because of swearing and sexual references  I dont think the swearing or innuendos are a problem because if they are young it will go over their heads and if they are older they are probably hearing it anyway  In the beginning there is a faked hanging and later a dead body and skeletons  Nothing really that I would say is supper worrisome,6
218917,699번,The Goonies,6,This movie is so good but it has bad words like st andbullst and Andy kisses Brand ,1
218942,699번,The Goonies,7,This Movie had talk of drugs in the beginning but also had swearing  I liked this Movie because it was funny to watch in 2018  The only complaint I have is you cant understand one of the kids  The kids name is Data,4
218943,699번,The Goonies,7,Its an 80s movie and rating systems were different back then  Kids do inappropriate things and has mature themes  I like the adventure and the story  I just believe its more for older audiences,3
218944,699번,The Goonies,7,This movie is awesome  I saw this movie when I was seven and my older sister was eight  I remember at the end of the movie her saying it was scary and yes it can be  If kids have a fear of strangers chasing them they might want to wait until they get older  Also there are a lot of scaring words so if you have an elevenyearold that is very immature wait until heshe is older and knows not to repeat them but there are no really bad words  There are a few kisses and scary scenes too  Recommended for mature tweens,7
218945,699번,The Goonies,7,I havent seen this movie in a few years but when I was 6 years old all I remembered was that I was so obsessed with The Goonies after I watched it  Some reviews state that situations are inappropriate but from what I recall this was a brilliant adventure made for kids  Go watch this classic,3
218946,699번,The Goonies,7,I watched this when I was 6 didnt understand some stuff,1
218947,699번,The Goonies,7,A great movie to watch with the whole  family Beware  some language  All the main character are fighting for the right to keep there homes,2
218948,699번,The Goonies,7,The Goonies was OK but there is swearing   Words used include shi and dam  There was a lot of editing mistakes I noticed as well  Also there were a few sexual scenes,4
218949,699번,The Goonies,7,Curious to see the reviews on this movie I read a couple of them  I think the parents are overreacting   My mom bought this movie for us and we all had some good laughs They say sht 19 times but thats what every kid will here in the real world do dont make them live under a rock My mom was very glad she bought this movie because not many kids movies make me laugh This would probably be a PG13 movie nowadays but nonetheless a great funny movie the whole family can enjoy Many kids in my class love this movie For little kids most of the sex jokes and bad words just fly right over their heads usually its not clear what they mean and could be easily interpreted as something else that is not bad  Enjoy watching,9
218950,699번,The Goonies,7,its a good movie,1
219007,700번,The Grandmaster,8,My rating PG13 some intense violence,1
220533,730번,The Hunger Games,7,,2
220534,730번,The Hunger Games,7,I was OBSESSED with this movie It has quite a bit of violence but its not horrible  There is not that much swearing  The reason why I give 10 and up is because theres nothing horrible in this movie  If you like the series divergent you would like this movie A LOT,5
220535,730번,The Hunger Games,7,The movie tells the story of Katniss Everdeen in a competition with 24 other contestants and only 1 can live  There is not much blood but some scenes are very violent and somewhat suspenseful  Katniss is a strong role model too,3
220536,730번,The Hunger Games,7,Parents Katniss is one of the best role models I have ever seen   The movie is pretty violent though it is not afraid to show some blood  Critical This film is a thought provoking adventure about a future world which celebrates a battle to the death disguised as a reality show known only as the Hunger Games  The second hour is very intense THIS PART WAS RETARDED My only complaint is that it is too long before the titular conflict starts  Overall 4 65,5
220537,730번,The Hunger Games,7,This is REALLY violent You better read the book or see the 2nd movie You see a LOT of blood and its more for like a 11 year old or a MATURE 10 YEAR OLD if you really LOVE your  9 year old  up kids dont watch this Its VERY scary but the Second movie is good 10 up can see catching fire D D,7
220538,730번,The Hunger Games,7,I liked it when I watched it then I went to go see catching fire and now I hate this film along with Catching fire  The dumbest movies I have ever witnessed  Too violent sad and WAY too intense  But is there anything good about this movie Well I like the soundtrack and I can tell that it was very well edited and they did a great job on it  I just dont like it,6
220539,730번,The Hunger Games,7,Its a great book full of emotions and struggles  I wouldnt recommend this for younger kids since its got mature themes,2
220540,730번,The Hunger Games,7,There is a lot of violence  This is something to look into because the movie is really all about an event that is all out violence  There is some swearing and not too much but a bit of sexual content  There is also drinking  So before letting a 10yearold see this movie see what they can and cant handle,5
220541,730번,The Hunger Games,7,The movie was as good as the book and almost have the same scenes as the book  You should really watch the movie first then read the book because when i try reading the book at age 10 it was kind of hard to understand so i decided to wait for the movie to come out and see what happens  I understand way better after seeing the movie so i read the book and now i understand everything But readers i dont recommend this movie to anyone under 15 because of the violence and the gore,4
220542,730번,The Hunger Games,7,The movie is fine except at the beginning its really boring  There is some violence I dont really remember most of it but it wasnt too bad  Oh ya at one part the creepy dogs were scary  I think most kids would be ok with it if they can skip the kissing There is some kissing  I didnt have nightmares or anything from the movie  Its no worse than Iron Man and those movies  Almost the same for violence and action  I guess you just have to know if your kid would be ok with it  My mom and dad knew I would be ok,10
221378,740번,The Incredibles,7,Yes I consider this a superhero movie because IRON MAN 3 a big name Marvel movie STEALS the plot point   Look at how much that made and youll know what Im talking about   It has some adult stuff in it but it will probably fly over the kids heads   Also your kid WILL BE addicted to superheros after this GUARANTEE,4
221379,740번,The Incredibles,7,a really good cartoon,1
221380,740번,The Incredibles,7,Cool,1
221381,740번,The Incredibles,7,really good some sex and violence but this is one of not Pixars not little kids movies,2
221382,740번,The Incredibles,7,The Incredibles is definitely worth your time  The plot and storyline is good the CGI is wonderful and the movie itself is just EPIC If youre a fan of action packed films or CGI youll probably love this,3
221383,740번,The Incredibles,7,its good,1
221384,740번,The Incredibles,7,Yep its incredible alright  I love this film  Great CGI perfect acting amazing writing and the plot is super creative and just VERY wellexucted sorry if I spelt that wrong,3
221385,740번,The Incredibles,7,My favorite movie as a kid still to this day a huge superhero fan I have to warn u the robot will scare young kids  scared me but that didnt stop me from watching it   my only problem is the powers werent creative  they are the same as fantastic 4s,6
221386,740번,The Incredibles,7,perfect,1
221568,746번,The Iron Giant,7,Seriously CSM my 2yr old cousin watches this like every day and he loves it  Also what the hell is inappropriate about laxitives all it does is give you diarrhea and help with diets  What Im saying is that this movie is so great and appropriate that even the youngest children will probably love this,3
221569,746번,The Iron Giant,7,Good and funny movie with happy and sad bits   Nice style of cartoons   Happy ending,3
221570,746번,The Iron Giant,7,This movie is an absolute masterpiece  But it is quite dark but thats just one of the things that make it so good  It definitely stays true to its 1957 setting but it might not be appropriate for younger kids  The main protagonist is a 9 year old boy named Hogarth Hughes who befriends a giant robot from outer space  Although the robot is friendly the main antagonist a U S  government official named Kent Mansley is paranoid of him possibly due to the Cold War  There is a scene where Hogarth secretly slips chocolateflavored laxatives into Mansleys smoothie I think this was to ditch him   There is also another scene where a deer is shot and even a scene where Mansley uses Chloroform in Hogarth  The film also uses words like Hell and Damn  However there are also positive messages  For example Hogarth tells the Iron Giant things like Killing is Bad Guns Kill You are who you choose to be and Souls dont die  At the end Mansleys paranoia causes him to launch a missile that he later finds out spells certain doom on the whole town  As the town looks up in the sky knowing they are just mere minutes from death the Iron Giant decides to sacrifice himself by flying into the missile before its even close to the ground in a very emotional scene saving the town  6 months later the Iron Giant is revealed to be starting to be selfrebuilt right before the movie cuts to black  Its an amazing film but might not be suitable for little kids  Its also a perfect illustration of 1957 USA,15
221571,746번,The Iron Giant,7,A boy finds this creature from outer space teaches it about the world tries but fails to convince anyone about his discovery and later the government attempts to hunt down the creature  E T  the ExtraTerrestrial right Yes and no  Though very similar and a lot less content worries The Iron Giant set in the 1950s when the Russians had just deployed the Sputnik into space distinguishes itself from E T  by one 100 ft  metal man,6
221572,746번,The Iron Giant,7,Huh  I seem to have a very long pattern of liking cartoons on the front where the animation can seemingly cover up the plot holes bad voice acting generic storyline e t c  When you start to put aside the animation and put a supreme focus on pure quality you may relook at youre favorite movies and go Wow  This has gotten a LOT worse  I mean a LOT worse  This seems to be somewhat of a normality among todays audiences and this is 2015 so maybe as much as everyone loves it they will relook at Inside Out and say   Okay maybe thats a bit too much  There are some cartoons however that are so dated that its much much easier to look at the very apparent flaws in the movie and not love it in the first place  At this point this is where The Iron Giant is doomed  Sure it may have lasted a little to make enough money for the Warner Bros to continue and such whereas even the current movies will be looked down at eventually but old movies such as Citizen Kane have so much to fall back on even if it is outdated the smart acting stellar storyline fantastic directing I could go on forever  These arent the movies that become outdated but The Iron Giant really doesnt have that to fall back on  The characters are rather traditional and really pushes it to see how moral they can go before it becomes something of a school project to induce good morals which isnt a good thing in movies where the adults have been over that and want to see quality  So youngsters may enjoy it and that alone would be a fair reason to go out and see it but there are even more primary flaws to come The voice acting is also the cheesy moral thing and the animation is very choppy not detailed and supremely 2Dish  The storyline also doesnt do anything creative  Its a lot easier to look over the flaws of a movie if the cartoon aspect doesnt affect you so maybe I should start rewatching as well  But although not too quality the young children maybe five or six adding to the fact that only a bit of peril will not bother them might not be as affected by the issues that make this movie as problematic as it is  Itll actually be one of their favorites if the parents are open to a bit of peril and notatallbadviolence which they probably will be  Movies0000,18
221573,746번,The Iron Giant,7,It was a lot different from the usual movies either princesses or super heroes always are the majority of the viewers  This movie was a very interesting one and teaches good lessons to children,2
221574,746번,The Iron Giant,7,I think its a really sweet touching story that the whole family will enjoy and it is very funny in some parts  I definitely recommend it  Its awesome,3
221575,746번,The Iron Giant,7,this is a very good movie but the end is sad and used to make me cry when i was little,1
221576,746번,The Iron Giant,7,I am 7 years old and I really really did not I repeat did not like it at all   beucause I think that it was incredibly sad a specially beucause of the end and the scene with the deer,2
221671,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,This film nails it right on the head as far as quality goes and even though its not a musical they do homage to a few of the songs e g  Bare neccities I wanna be like you Trust in me   Unlike the animated classic it is more entertaining and has more of a plot  And the CGI is beautiful as well  Share Khan was AWESOME Oh and he was quite intimidating as well and kills at least one character  Kaa is kind of creepy but her scene was awesome no WinneThePooh voice instead Scarlett Johansten  Overall very fun film,8
221672,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,The actor who played Mowgli is so talented and telling from the fact that he was the only human actor shown on screen he did absolutely amazing  The special effects are terrific to    You can barely tell on most animals that they are not real In some scenes it is very quiet but then something very surprising happens which can make you jump  Thats why I think that kids 9 and up would enjoy it better since they are used to movies that may be a little more intense,4
221673,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,The Jungle Book is about how Mowgli Neel Sethi has to find his way back to the man village as a fearsome tiger named Shere Khan Idris Elba is on the hunt for him  The Jungle Book is a film that I feel is  too charming and joyful to not like  There are some moments where i was on the edge of my seat or biting my nails or jumping when Shere Khan is on screen popping up everywhere  The voice talents are amazing my personal favorite being Idris Elba as Shere Khan,4
221674,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,I recently watched this at the theaters on a special outing with my grandparents  Though it is targeted toward a younger audience I thought it was a excellent movie for any age full of excitement fun and a lesson on learning to be who you are  Standalone actor Neel Sethi the young lead protagonist took it all on himself and surprisingly did a amazing job  I say at least four stars,4
221675,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,You can really tell that its just a kid in a green room the whole time because the acting is really weak  None of the reactions from Mowgli feel genuine and why would they Special effects are stunning of course  Bill Murray was Bill Murray and Christopher Walken was great as the enormous fleshy orangutan king,4
221676,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,This movie is really fun and the graphics are really cool   The panther bear and wolves looked so cuddly    There is no language that I remember hearing   There are a few parts that are scary when the giant monkey chases him and captures him and when Sheer Khan the tiger is chasing him and threatening to kill him   It would scare a younger audience but when I went there with my 11 year old friend she loved it   I did not like the monkey because his singing was really annoying   There are two songs in the movie   The monkey sings a song and then Bear Necessities is sang   There is a lot of clean humor that much younger kids would not understand but I thought it was funny   There are a few parts that are intense and make you jump but all in all it was a great movie,10
221677,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,A word of advice if youre seeing this film  dont be holding anything that could spill  You will jump out of your seat  I promise  The movie isnt all that bad though  It had some gorgeous animation and a really sweet story,5
221678,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with this one  The trailer looked gorgeous but of course theres always the chance that the movie doesnt live up to the advertisement I couldnt be more wrong  The very first scene begins with a chasetraining of some sort and it immediately captured my attention  I didnt particularly love the young actor who portrayed Mowgli at first but he eventually began to grow on me  The cinematography is beautiful the animals are realistic the battles scenes between the animals keep you wonderfully sitting on the edge of your seat  Even if you arent familiar with the story of The Jungle Book classic you can still enjoy this film  Theres quite a bit of violence throughout the film such as the animals attacking each other but I wouldnt consider it an unnecessary to the movie  Its a film both children and adults will love and the high ratings that its received is by no means an overstatement  I would encourage you to go see it  Its probably the best film Ive seen this year,9
221679,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,Parents should be aware that this version of The Jungle Book is darker more intense and scarier than the original 1967 picture  It is an amazing visual experience the CGI is incredibly realistic and the green screen is flawless  This enhances the viewing but also makes the fight scenes scarier  A very minor amount of blood can be seen just a few cuts and bruises and the fight between animals feature loud sound effects clawing biting but no blood  One death will hit hard as it happens very quickly and has a jump scare  Speaking of jump scares there are three or four of them in The Jungle Book  Children under 8 wont be able to handle them  The film has some serious gritty moments but also some very fun and joyful moments songs jokes etc   It is an amazing experience with Oscar worthy visual effects stellar voice acting Ben Kingsley Scarlett Johanson Idris Elba and humour  Children under 8 may need to cover their eyes for 1 or 2 scenes but not often,10
221680,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,ModarateViolencescary scenesperilupsetting scenes  Very mild language  However the film is about friends and teamwork but the are explained through emotional moments,3
221891,758번,The Karate Kid,8,I think that most kids can definitely watch this although younger kids might find it boring  It does have some fight scenes so if your child is sensitive to violence this may not be a good pick  It really just depends on your child  I think its a great movie,4
221892,758번,The Karate Kid,8,i think this is awesome,1
221893,758번,The Karate Kid,8,Great movie with lots of positive messages  The violence in this movie is not too much for kids to tolerate  Daniel is a great role mode though this movie has some faults  Like the movie writer seems to think that girls are weak and cant defend themselves  One example of this is when Mr  Miygi said to Daniel that he was Punching like a girl  Over all a great movie that has some flaws,6
221894,758번,The Karate Kid,8,Mr Myagi teaches Daniel Kung Fu so he can defend himself the next time he gets bullied at school  Then Daniel goes to a karate competition and gets hurt really badly in the knee but gets back up  Then in the final round Daniel goes up against the one who shows no mercy for Daniel  His name is Johnny  Daniel does what Mr Myagi taught him and wins,5
221895,758번,The Karate Kid,8,The Karate Kid is an amazing movie that the whole family  from little kids to grandparents  can enjoy  The violence is little and is used in the Karate scenes and one bullying scene in which you see a little blood  Swearing is also little with only a few bad words such as damn and basterd  The racist term slope is also used  One of our villains Johnny is rolling a joint in one scene but that will fly right over kids heads  There is nothing sexual in the film except for a lengthy kiss  The message in this film is also great and Mr Miyagi is a huge role model,7
221896,758번,The Karate Kid,8,Ok soooo the actual movie is rated 15 England because of drugs and violence some sexual stuff but highschool era,1
221897,758번,The Karate Kid,8,A classic movie that is appropriate  for kids This website tends to stretch its reviews so basically most kids can hardly watch anything  I that the goal anyway I think this movie is awesome and any kid can see it maybe not really little kids but otherwise everybody,4
221898,758번,The Karate Kid,8,I think this is a great movie  But it is still best for older kids  The violence is generally mild but there are bruises on faces a small amount of suggestive themes as well as some use of mild language and less inappropriate insults such as bullst the GD word the D word frigging and bastd  But one thing parents and kids can talk about is not everything is the way it seems  Anyway this is a great movie that I would highly recommend for martial arts fans,4
221899,758번,The Karate Kid,8,This film has heartwarming moments as the main character Daniel bonds with an unlikely friend and mentor mr Miyagi  Mr Miyagi works as a janitor but he can pull a punch  Having found out that mr Miyagi is a karate master Daniel requests training after numerous beatings by Johnny the school bully who has a black belt in karate  Meanwhile he develops a relationship with Johnnys exgirlfreind Ali  All in all I think this is a suitable film for most ages and in my view the best movie ive ever seen,5
222965,791번,The Lion King (1994),6,I was watching this movie a little while ago and i said i think i might rewind and watch it again  i think in my life i have watched this movie over 4000 times its soooo good     i would reremend this movie to 5,3
222966,791번,The Lion King (1994),6,Extremely good yet sad and scary for young kids,1
222967,791번,The Lion King (1994),6,this movie was really good in 3D but some parts would be too scary for younger kids   like near the end there is some fighting which was kind of scary but it was really good,2
222968,791번,The Lion King (1994),6,I think its absurd that any parent would find this movie inappropriate for kids above 4  I watched Lord of The Rings when i was 6 and I wasnt scarred for life  I definitely didnt need therapy,3
222969,791번,The Lion King (1994),6,I think the original Lion King is great,1
222970,791번,The Lion King (1994),6,The film is good quite a bit of violence and lots of scary scenes but note this film was NOT released 2011  It was released far before that  Its only been rereleased in cinemas  Please get your classics right,4
222971,791번,The Lion King (1994),6,This is my favorite movieand I  think it is fairly educational because of the animals and naturejust as long your kids are able to understand it,1
222972,791번,The Lion King (1994),6,I give it a G,1
222973,791번,The Lion King (1994),6,I like this movie,1
223032,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,Yall really need to lighten up on this movie  Ariel has cleavage but guess what Its barely any its not explicit and shes a 16 year old wearing a shell bra  She has a chest  Grow up  Shes not really a good role model given the whole you need to be pretty to get the guy thing but this is a classic Disney movie made with the classic Disney formula  Cinderella doesnt get the guy until she transforms but I dont see anyone talking bad about her  Anyway the only genuinely iffy thing is basically Ursulas character  She eats live sea creatures in  a scene keep in mind this is basically cannibalism in this world Ursula calls Ariel a tramp when she Ariel is successfully impressing Eric and Ursulas death is actually pretty dark for a Disney movie but nothing your kids probably cant handle  Theres also a scene with a shark at the beginning of the movie  Overall this movie is fine for kids and the parents on this site are honestly ridiculous,11

223034,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,The movie that relaunched Disney and started the Disney Renaissance a period where some of the best Disney films are considered to have been made is none other than The Little Mermaid one of the most beloved Disney films made   The story of a young but rebellious teenage mermaid who strikes a deal with an evil sea witch to   ah youll find out   Just make sure you see this one if youre a Disney fan,3
223035,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,This is such a good movie Im probably older than I should be to watch Disney princess movies but nothing will ever beat the Little Mermaid  I wasnt going to write a review but some of the ones I saw  from  overly sensitive parents are ridiculous  There is no way that I would ever want to raise my child in a world where The Little Mermaid is,4
223036,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,one of my favorite Disney movies to date  Great soundtrack some humor and great animation totally worth watching,2
223037,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,I love this movie From the songs to the loveable characters to the hopeless romantics out there  I adored this movie,3
223038,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,Teaches kids to explore the world and there is a lot out there  But there is some innuendo,2
223039,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,This is an AWESOME movie Ariel is a positive role model for everyoneeven boys  She teaches us to stand up for what we believe in  Eric is a positive role model because 1 He is not full of himself 2 During the firebirthday scene he shows that he LOVES his dog Max  He went back into the fire and he risked his life just so he could save Max,5
223040,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,this disney movie has AWFULL role models and a DISGUSTING message  The movie shows ariel disrespecting her father never listening to him and causing trouble she changes herself to be with a prince come on is that really a lesson we want kids to see  and just so you know in the original book where the little mermaid was based on for the movie ariel DIES so this movie is bad please dont show it to your kids changing your body is not a lesson we want to give them,3
223041,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,very scery ursula is very scery i didint even finish it,1
223060,793번,The Little Mermaid,4,Honestly some of you parents need to calm down  Those who say shes not wearing enough clothes really Shes a mermaid do you expect her to wear a T shirt And as for she liked Eric just for his looks 1  She saw he had a passion for music like she did and 2  When he recieved a statue of himself for his birthday he made a disgusted face showing he wasnt vain or full of himself  The music is absolutely stunning and in no way sexual like some of you freak parents are saying  One of Disneys best movies that I love even though Im almost 13,8
223061,793번,The Little Mermaid,4,This is one of the fine movies ever  Ariel is good  She reminds me of the time I was swimming during August  Ursula is the witch who has won the lottery  She has Ariels voice for good which is bad for infants  Eric is beautiful He loves Ariel  Flounder is a comedy fish who teases on Scuttle  Fine movie,9
223062,793번,The Little Mermaid,4,This film sends out a great message that if you set your mind to something you will succeed,1
223063,793번,The Little Mermaid,4,My fav movie of all time  I watch it all the time and it never gets old  Those kids who think that her outfit has to much cleavage then u should watch ballroom dancing cause that is too much cleavage not Ariels dresses  They are just normal outfits  And this movie is one of the best classics out there  I know her songs by heart and know all the lines  I say this movie should be for all ages because it has a lesson learn some risk in life are worth taken that is the real moral and that what the creators of the little mermaid was going for  Unlike mordern Disney movies The Little Mermaid touches hearts of ppl of all ages  It has that sort of spark to it please let your kids see the movie  They would love it  I know I did when I first saw it and I still love it,11
223064,793번,The Little Mermaid,4,The Little Mermaid is like a SAW cartoon,1
223065,793번,The Little Mermaid,4,I LOVE the Little Mermaid But when I was reading the reviews I noticed that some parents find that Ariels clothing choice isnt good  I mean really Do you want her to go around in a turtle neck I think you all are over protective of your kids they have to grow up sometime  You probably dont even let them watch Elmo  They probably have to watch the movie on ABCs all the time  Come on This is a great movie Ariel is a strong young woman who inspires girls to do what they believe in  Its either this or what they will find out online  Disney wouldnt make any movies too scary,12
223066,793번,The Little Mermaid,4,why does everyone thinks its inappropiate 17 and older really this movie is for 6 year olds it does not teach girls to show off their bodies shes a mermaid what else is she going to wear a Tshirt this is a good movie for little kids if your daughter watches this its not like theyll what their belly button showing and what to wear tight clothes parents are to picky about what there child watches,1
223067,793번,The Little Mermaid,4,this is a great movie for kids but my daughter always want to be like ariel lol,1

223126,804번,The Man from Snowy River,8,Review The Man from Snowy River,1
223127,804번,The Man from Snowy River,8,I recall watching this with my family multiple times as a child and loving the idea that this movie presents  There is some swearing which was a little unnecessary but I never picked up on it as a kid and only realized the cussing when I last rewatched it  There are a few kisses Three I think which never bothered me or my family but it may others  A few of the characters get drunk but are so tipsy that they only made a fool of themselves and the main character Jim looks down on them so it is not seen as a good thing  another character smokes a cigarrete but the result is having horse dung thrown on his shoe and is also shown as a bad thing and Jim tells him something smart about how stupid the choice to smoke was,5

223617,821번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,Other reviewers have already given a good overview but I have a few notes to add,1
223618,821번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,This is a FANTASTIC movie to watch as a family it really shows deeply people need to unplug from media and is well made  Some of the song choices are    odd and also ONE ANNOYING THING THE KIDS VOICE SOUNDS LIKE AN ADULT  THIS LITTLE BOY SOUNDS LIKE HE IS 30,4
223619,821번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,It uses a basic premise and mixes it with an innovative animation style a few character dynamics and tropes that arent seen in cinema often and a realistic family conflict,1
223620,821번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,I lovee this movie  Its very funny  A few tears of laughter may escape you  It is perfect to see with the family,4
223621,821번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,First off this movie has great representation of LGBTQ people with the main character being hinted as lesbian through the movie finally revealing at the end of the movie Also Autism representation The son is likely to be autistic although it is never actually said  with extreme obsessions with dinosaurs and misunderstanding social cues  Also the movie critiques consumerism and capitalism in the digital age through hilarious gags,4
223622,821번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,When I thought about watching this I was sorta like OMG this is going to be 35 stars  BUT I was WRONG This thrilling animated adventure about a family surviving through the robot appocalypse is a beautiful example of teamwork scifi and comedy  Buckle your seat belt for hilarious actionsequences and one crazy family as they drive across the country to save the world,4
223623,821번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,The Mitchells vs the Machines was a really amazing animated film  It had great characters and the animation was absolutely refined  Surprisingly the film was made by the same studio that made The Emoji Movie  I recommend this for ages 10 and up because some scenes can be frightening to some viewers  Just wow,5
223624,821번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,Well for a movie enthusiast who loves watching all sorts of films would say this TRULY is one best movies Ive Seen In Years The Mitchells vs the Machines is a Great Funny Family Film that would be great for all AGES  I think even as a 14 year old I find this film better than most of the Pixar Movies  It truly is a MustSee Film to Watch,4
223870,836번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,I watched this since I was like 5 but it scared me until I was 12  I was seriously horrified and couldnt watch this is Halloween without having nightmares for weeks  Now as a 14 year old I love all the tim burton movies with my whole heart,3
223871,836번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,its fine   I like how its stopmotion and that its directed by henrey selik who also directed Coraline aka the greatest most amazing beautiful emotional fantastic masterpeice which im watching right now   In other words go watch Coraline instead,3
223872,836번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,The Nightmare before Christmas is such a great Tim Burton movie and for those who says its scary inappropriate and creepy youre crazy  Rebecca Spark is Crazybutt This film has the incredible luxury of being a holiday film that is viewable for TWO different holidays or year round if you desire  It is shown on TV during October and December and occasionally November as well  Been heard of Henry Selick directed this movie he also directed Coraline  I saw it since when I was 7 watching Haunted Mansion holiday and I watched both Henry Selick films  Even I watched Corpse Bride I drew both Emily and Sally and both are Tim Burton  Holly R have been a fan of watching this movie since she was 5 and it was still newish  It takes a special kind of smaller child to not feel scared of everything in todays world but this has just the right amount of scares and humor  Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King and a mascot for Halloween who is becoming tired of the same old Halloween stuff every year  He stumbles across the world of Christmas and becomes intrigued by Santa and all the happiness that is in Christmas so he decides that he wants to be Santa  Its a fun spooky and jolly holiday movie with a Oogie Boogie Man who isnt really scary because he is just a sackbag that has eyes and a mouth  He has bugs inside his body  He might scare very sensitive children but if your kids are not sensitive and can handle similar movies like Corpse Bride then by all means this is for them  The stopmotion animation is great good plot great music cool ghoul characters and some characters are good role models especially Sally  I like when he explains Christmas  My favorite scene is when Fanfavorite Jack disguises as Sandy Claus and pranks all children for presents  Its funny Though Disney plus have parental guidance when you played the movie  I have a art teacher who is a fan of Tim Burton  I recommend for ages 7 because of some scenes can be frightening for sensitive younger viewers but older can handle it  Great Tim Burton,22
223873,836번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,This movie has a great story and great animation  It has a tad bit of violence but other than that it is a wonderful film  The characters are great and the story is perfect  This is one of Disneys best films  No language or anything inappropriate  Great film over all,6
223874,836번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,Parents need to know that unlike most Tim Burton films this movie is for kids  Some stuff that might creep out kids such as ripping off arms spiders bats and monsters  One character opens up his head  Wonderful family movie,4
223875,836번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,There is nothing wrong with it and the claymation is beautiful  the main character does try to steal christmas but sees the error of his ways   The people in halloween town are all monsters but none of them are scary  the main character is a skeleton and he takes off his head once or twice,4
223876,836번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,Really good movie,1
223877,836번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,This is a great movie but kinda gross  Theres a song at the start the shows a load of creepy deformed monsters singing about Halloween  Good movie but 5 and below need to wait one or two years for some of it,3
223878,836번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,Good thing it was rated PG   It was scarier than I thought   Kids should be 8 to watch it alone 7 to watch it with an adult   If kids dont like scary stuff then dont watch this movie,4
224262,845번,The Office,7,This show is possibly the best comedy ever There is light cursing damn hell bitch ass crap and there are a few drug references Dwight finds a joint in the parking lot Ryan gets addicted to cocaine both are played for laughs lots of sex references and talk of genitals and finally a small amount of violence  Its all played for laughs but some younger kids could imitate some of the dumb stuff Michael Dwight and Andy do  Jump off a building into a box throw scissors at each other throw watermelon at cars off the top of a building  The show is hilarious and I would 100 recommend it to anyone,5
224263,845번,The Office,7,often offensive show that holds up in some areas and plunges head first in others  your child has to be mature enough to understand the weight of some of the jokes and has to know that many of the jokes are offensive and that some of the actual beliefs behind the jokes are dangerous to actually believe in,2
224264,845번,The Office,7,The Office is a great show  There are a fair number of inappropriate jokes and references so if you were going to watch solo I would recommend for 12  However if an adult will watch with you I would okay it for 1011 year olds as well  My 10 year old sister and I watched it with our mom and it was fine  However before letting your 10 year old watch it you should know that there are several thats what she said jokes as well as a few about race and sex there are several references to sex and having sex one of the characters Meredith is an alcoholic some characters smoke and there is some language  Anything too inappropriate is bleeped out but there are damns and dammits as well as a few other not so nice words  If none of the above is an issue for you then great let your kid watch The Office,7
224265,845번,The Office,7,My brother used to watch The office before after it leaves Netflix USA at the end of the year and its available on peacock now  I watched it because its not that badly after they talk about sex theres swearing like sort of st nor maybe some dirty stuff words but some F bombs may be use in this show right now  OK for 14 or 15 should be watchin this,3
224266,845번,The Office,7,I love this show and think that it is totally appropriate to kids 13 and up  But it is a bit awkward to watch with parents,2
224267,845번,The Office,7,Most mature jokes just go over your head  Some episodes are inappropriate with sx jokes and racy jokes but overall its an amazing comedy romance and family show,2
224268,845번,The Office,7,I love this show but there are some not safe for work  jokes however Evan though my rating says 12 but it really depends if your child has been through 7th grade health  education,1
224269,845번,The Office,7,This is the absolute funniest show Ive ever seen the characters are relatable yet hilarious great plotlines for a comedy lots of  great improvision starts to decline once sabre purchases Dunder Mifflin still hilarious ending was great,1
224270,845번,The Office,7,iffy but funny and good,1
225477,874번,The Polar Express,6,This was not a good movie  I watched it as a teenager and even found it too creepy I would think little kids would be terrified  It is very unrealistic the conductor is mean and irresponsible and it included many unnecessarily scary sceens ghost on roof puppet room train out of control lost ticket even the beginning with the shaking as the train arrives  Our family watched it thinking it would be a cheerful and holiday movie for young children but it was creepy   Not even the elves were cute The only thing that was relatively sweet about the movie was the friendship between the three kids and the messages of kindness and friendship  I wasnt scared but I would imaging young children would be quite scared its not a good movie for little kids  I would recommend that nobody regardless of age watch the movie,8
225478,874번,The Polar Express,6,This movie is a great movie for all ages it shows all the importance in christmas than  just getting gifts  and santa  Christmas is jesuss birthday and should teach you the importance in family life,2
225479,874번,The Polar Express,6,in the boys house there is never light just dark and the train is way too loud  Please dude gimme a better movie,2
225480,874번,The Polar Express,6,This film contains positive messages role models  THE POLAR EXPRESS is a fun movie for kids aged 6 and up,2
225481,874번,The Polar Express,6,You shouldnt be worried about this AT all no bad language no other stuff and any intended scariness is just yelling with anger  This was the first movie I watched when I was 2 and I still love it Great role models and messages of the right thing to do not only for yourself but to help other people too,3
225482,874번,The Polar Express,6,I love the positive message and the roles that family play in this film   I loved the characters and the story about traveling on an express train to the north pole and going through some twist and turns just to be the first kid ever to receive the first gift,2
225483,874번,The Polar Express,6,My all time favorite christmas movie,2
225484,874번,The Polar Express,6,This is the best Christmas movie ever Me and my family watch this every year  I always feel like I am on Christmas Eve night when I watch this movie and it makes every kid ready for the night before Christmas  It teaches a lesson about how you do not need to see something to believe in it  You should believe in something because you feel it is right  It also teaches the true meaning of Christmas and shows the time spent with family and all the Christmas activities  This is my favorite movie ever I would recommend this to everyone Please give yourself a great Christmas treat and go watch it right now,9
225485,874번,The Polar Express,6,greatest movie ever great christmas film for little kids  five stars up but only at christmastime,4
225908,880번,The Princess Bride,7,This movie is not remotely bad  The stakes are always high and Wesley the protagonist befriends many previous enemies including Inigo Montoya who is out for revenge  His father was killed by a man with six fingers on one hand  He practices a phrase every day  Wesley also befriends Fezzick a giant man who helps Wesley in every way possible  Princess Buttercup is being forced to marry against her will so Wesley Inigo and Fezzick go on a long quest to rescue her from Prince Humperdink and the six fingered man  There is no swearing but there is a small amount of drinking,7
225909,880번,The Princess Bride,7,I will say  I get scared easily by movies  But I think that this movie has too much violence  Bad people put a good man into a torture machine the princess is planning to commit suicide a man sticks a knife into anothers stomach This movie gave me nightmares for a while after I saw it   Not a bad movie unless youre too young when you watch it and then its just awful,4
225910,880번,The Princess Bride,7,This movie is one of my favorites Its not to violent and its great Barely to little sex a man makes a comment about a princesss breasts will go over kids heads the swearing is very mild Jesuss name is misused once briefly    Son of a btch used once  I would say WITH PARENTS a six year old could watch it  Keep in mind its rated PG,7
225911,880번,The Princess Bride,7,Very entertaining and funny  Quite a lot of kissing though,2
225912,880번,The Princess Bride,7,This is one of the best movies of all time Cary Elwes is the BEST in this movie  Other than men in tights If anything I would say its kind of violent  In the Fire Swamp the princess dress gets on fire but it is quickly put out with nobody injured  In the same scene Wesley Cary Elwes is attacked by an ROUSRodent of unusual size and bit twice by a giant rat that might seem a little scarey  Once in the arm and another time in the shoulder  He screams in pain and eventually sets the rat on fire  It moans and Wesley stabs it three times to put it out of its misery  Wesley and the princess share quite a few passionate kisses  A bad guy is poisoned but it is very silly   Lots of talk of torture  One reference to the princess breasts  Iningo Montoya gets stabbed at least three times  Then he stabs his enemy at least three times and kills him  Two torture scenes in the pit of despair  Son of a btch is used once  God a few times  All of this may sound bad but its not  Its also a FANTASTIC  MOVIE,20
225913,880번,The Princess Bride,7,Many people have told me that The Princess Bride was perfect the best film of all time and a classic  Did it live up to the hype For me it did not  On a technical basis it could have been improved  One of the biggest problems I had with this film was the pacing  By that I mean how elaborate it was  When Buttercup and Wesley were reunited we get to see more of their relationship but that quickly ends and kinds of sabotages the romance which is not good since this is kind of a romance film  The next problem I had with the movie was the consistency of tone  At one point of the movie it was very kidfriendly then towards the end it got bloody  I questioned if I was still watching the same movie and this problem was one of my biggest issues with the movie Hook  I might be coming off as a hater of The Princess Bride but I assure you I dont hate this movie  I really enjoyed the comedy the movie had some solid performances and characters the movie had a cool story of rescuing and the swordfights were choreographed really well  Ill give The Princess Bride a 6 510  I was underwhelmed by this movie and I was hoping to give the movie an 1010  This kind of thing happens from time to time  I recommend The Princess Bride to children mostly,16
225914,880번,The Princess Bride,7,This is an unbelievable movie and so good  However there are two sword fights one which involves quite a few cuts and stabs and the eels might scare some young children  Some of the humor is a little adult and there are a few instances of mild swearing  Allinall though it is an amazing movie that anyone over 8 will absolutely love,4
225915,880번,The Princess Bride,7,This was a pretty good movie  It was REALLY funny at some parts  It was strange because some parts felt to fast and others to slow  The romance was nice but it was definitely fairytale Not real  I didnt really feel or see any personality in the characters  buttercup was a damsel in distress who sort was just there to be rescued  Westley had personality and I liked him well enough  the three bad guys two who werent really bad were fun  I didnt really see the point in the prince wanting to kill buttercup I think it was another part of the damsel in distress thing  But I really did like the movie,10
225916,880번,The Princess Bride,7,Great film that is a different kind of princess story but still so much fun to watch  Funny and exciting I recommend this movie to all children 6 and up,2
225927,880번,The Princess Bride,7,Princess Bride was one of those movies I kept hearing about and it seems you arent a real movie buff unless you watch it  I can tell its infinitely quotable to those who grew up watching it but the enormous rats even scared me so kids above 10 should have no problem seeing it  Very clever especially with the hilarious Andre the Giant,3
225928,880번,The Princess Bride,7,The Princess Bride is an 80s classic for good reason   its nearly perfect  Our protagnist is Buttercup a young woman who loves to torment her farm boy Westley   who only replies As you wish to her every command  Later she realizes he loves her and she loves him too  When Westley is sent to war and killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts Buttercup grieves  An evil prince takes advantage of this by choosing her for his bride  However shes kidnappedand a villain named Vizzini attempts to murder her but the Dread Pirate Roberts saves her  Buttercup is annoyed because of what happened to Westley but why does he seem so familiarThere is lots of sword fighting and the scene in the fire swamp might be intense for the youngest viewers  A use of son of a b is used and as Buttercup contemplates suicide Westely mentions her perfect breasts  The comedy in this movie along with the action the romance and the fantays make it a big success  I particulary enjoy Billy Crystal as the wizard Andre the Giant as Fezzik the giant and Wallace Shawn as the evil Vizini,10
225929,880번,The Princess Bride,7,I thought it wasnt a very good movie but it had a good plot line  Although it would be a great movie for children there was a couple of moments in the movie where there was some language and really spoiled the movie  Therefore I think that you should not be allowed to watch this if you are 7 or under and should think about the person if they are under 10,3
225930,880번,The Princess Bride,7,Respect for the classics,1
225931,880번,The Princess Bride,7,I absolutely loved this movie I recommend for anyone to watch it,1
225932,880번,The Princess Bride,7,This is my favorite movie I love it because there is mostly harmless sword fighting a giant R O U S s rodents of unusual size lots of humorous and quotable one liners,3
225933,880번,The Princess Bride,7,I think this movie is very good but in the end there is some blood and violenceand there are some rodents of unusual size wich attack Wesley,1
225934,880번,The Princess Bride,7,I love this movie and i think it is great for anyone of any age that are not to scared of giant rats,1
225935,880번,The Princess Bride,7,As stated at the title  There are a few things I like better about the movie than the book is that you can actually hear what the priest sounds like  Dont mark this as inappropriate but he sounds like hes been kicked in the groan I dont know what else to call that,3
225936,880번,The Princess Bride,7,I really like the princess bride  its fun and adventurous  And I also like Westly and Buttercup   its very funny to me   ALERT  caution this movie is awesome   Why I think you should only watch this movie if your 10 or over is because when I watch it I have to skip a few parts because I am not allowed to see them  But one time I saw a few parts that I can not see by accident,7
226119,885번,The Proposal,6,I personally loved this movie  There are lots of curs words and rude words but a young child wouldnt understand that  At first i was worried it would be inapropriette but it wasnt   There is one seen when are stars collide because one is getting out of shower and one in to the shower  Biut i still all around LOVE this movie,6
226120,885번,The Proposal,6,This hilarious romcom is perfect and funny for teens of all ages,1
226121,885번,The Proposal,6,The problem with The Proposal is on its story and plot  Its just plain predictable  You can figure out how the movie is gonna end right in the first minutes,3
226122,885번,The Proposal,6,Haha I like this comedy movie This is not for kids   it shows naked woman and man bumped each other on the side  There are kissing    but very funny,4
226123,885번,The Proposal,6,i watched this and laughed soo hard and just loved the movie the only thing wz i wz watching it with my boy cuzzin who is as old as me and in the scene where they fall accidentally on each other naked was too awkward but overall a rlly good romanceCOMEDY,2
226124,885번,The Proposal,6,The movie is greatandvery interesting  I enjoyed it however the crash though unnessacary showed no sensitive body parts so younger children probably wouldnt even understand it  Overall a brilliant movie,3
226125,885번,The Proposal,6,WOW This movie is awesome There is a bit of nudity but nothing sensitive is shown  The woods scene with the grandmother is hilarious and it was super funny  I liked the movie any mature 12 year old would love this movie,5
226126,885번,The Proposal,6,Not for kids,1
226127,885번,The Proposal,6,This is a great and funny movie  It made me laugh all the way through it even at sad parts because they made it seem awkwardly funny  It had great characters and a very good story line  Might be inappropriate for some viewers though,4
226953,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,I liked this movie  Its funny and has funny stuff about pets  I liked how the main character had flaws and they all learned stuff,3
226954,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,I was expecting to watch a great movie for kids  What I actually saw was trash  This movie was so boring and the characters were really stupid and annoying,3
226955,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,The movie awesome and most kids likely elementary  up should handle it  There are a few dark messages about death and killing the rabbit character has the personality of murder but it doesnt get to intense  One scary scene most kids may be scared of is when the viper tries to bite Max  Duke Gidget has a serious crush on max but it isnt sexual A bird tries to kill Gidget but they becomes friends shortly afterward overall the movie is good,3
226956,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,The movie has good scenery and animation and teaches kids what others have been through  The story is great itself and has good characters,2
226957,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,If you have seen the trailer youve seen everything  The beginning starts of well and interesting but as it carries on you sit there feeling like you are wasting your time  So many stupid and unconvincing things occur  Very disappointed only the beginning is funny  The good bits are all in the trailer,5
226958,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,Several bad language uses    for older kids it is awesome,1
226959,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,This is the best movie ever with amazing characters and lots and lots and lots and lots of humor   This adventure would be best for kids who like animals and adventurous tales,2
226960,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,Its quite entertaining  I loved seeing this movie the first time it was released,2
226961,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,It is awesome especially if you are a pet lover I enjoyed it very much,1
226962,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,I heard words like shut up and  loser  The story was just rescue something,2
227874,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,I watched this when I was 9  It was funny  ,3
227875,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,I have seen this movie and we have it but this movie is very inappropriate lots of sex language and drinking and smoking  Barts private area is shown and of course bad language  Bart is the most main offender in this movie  Violence as well Lisa punches him  The most beautiful I saw in this movie was the wedding video there was this once scene that Homer and Marge not seen have a sex reference not in their bed being naked having no clothes on  Otherwise concerning film,6
227876,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,GREAT MOVIE But is inappropriate at most times and its mostly because of violence and sex,2
227877,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,Very good better than the orignial tv show  The only really bad thing is the penis shot shown for 3 and a half secondsI tracked and the rest is fine,2
227878,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,The Simpsons Movie as funny as it is is not for some kids  There is offensive stuff but make sure your kid can ignore the bad stuff  There is fighting but no blood beside Itchy and Scratchy cartoonish  Homer as normal loves beer  There are sexual references and a scene which implies sex  But nothing is graphic  There is language D A S B  There is some gun use  In the end Homer becomes a hero after learning to be less selfish and a better father to Bart,9
227879,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,homer is a positive role model drinking in a bar       your kids will look up to him and bart when he skateboards naked,1
227880,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,I really like this movie  Its very funny and entertaining  But there are stuff to watch out for  Bart can be seen skateboarding naked Bart also drinks later in the movie there is mild use of bad language and there is evidence of violence as seen during the angry mob scene  Its good but it is more explicit than the cartoon,5
227881,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,| and ,1
227882,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,The Simpsons Movie is a pretty awsome film for comical people aged 10  above  If your child is under that age some parts are a little unsuitable with some cheeky humour  Is it suitable for kids mostly yes  But like I said not all of it is perfectly suitable,4
227883,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,Swears only come every once in a while in the show but overall its usually only says B but not that often  Anyway it is a suitable show for kids 9 and up,2
228542,941번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,I watched this movie alone  I really enjoyed it even if im 14  I think this movie is OK to watch with kids though there are some scary moments and some of them may get scared  It has great messages,4
228543,941번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,I watched this movie when I was 7 or 8 and I do not recommend doing so  For what it was rated I think that it definitely should of been at least m pg13 great to watch with older kids,2
228544,941번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,Sword Fights people getting hit by cars an evil ogre threatening someones family kidnapping a character gets a bloody injury on their knee which requires medical attention that they dont have but it miraculously turns out better  Otherwise good fantasy movie for 9 and 10 yearolds which positive messages,2
228545,941번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,I loved this movie when I watched it as a kid it has some heavy fantasy themes and some creepy undertones  Some parts of the movie could be distressing for younger viewers ex  Bloody bites and scratches fighting off comical goblins with knives and tomato soup ect  But most intense things that do happen are kind of ridiculous  Things  do take a dark turn at the end though with the main character having to make peace with the death of his father by stabbing a monster that has taken on the form of his father in order to make him let his guard down  Overall I think The Spiderwick Chronicles is a great movie for older audiences or more mature kids,6
228546,941번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,The violence is honestly not a problem  Its all just animated stuff and any kid above 10 can take it,2
228547,941번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,I just went back and watched this movie Im 15 now but back when I first watched it age 7 it was amazing and introduced me to the Fae and Faeries  I think its very cool that there is a movie about the Fae  It even includes tons of facts about them  Now for the kids as long as your not coddling them then it should be fine,4
228548,941번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,Look first up the rumor about the dad getting stabbed in the chest was not true but I wont deny he got stabbed in the hand  Now comes the blood there was barely any blood in it except wounds similar to the ones that kids get every week by playing outside  Of course if you plan on letting a kid younger that 9 watch then make sure hell be able to handle it there is a a little bit of fear the goblins are trying to break the circle and the twin is taken away getting pulled by the legs if you watch the full movie kids will get the idea that its never too late to make things right Jared Grace was rude to his mother but in the end apologized  That also when people seem like they are lying they are right so not to judge or jump to conclusions Jared discovered the world and no one believed him which put his family in potential danger  It also gives the trust your gut message because while the decisions he made could have involved pain and scariness and a lot of risk his gut said he was right and he was,5
228549,941번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,pretty violent  my sister ran out of the house screaming because of the blood and screaming when they got scratched,2
228550,941번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,There is a giant goblin and he would definitely scare little kids he is in a lot of scenes and they have a big fight and he stabs the goblin,1
229901,1031번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,This movie isnt as good as Japanese Futa,1
229902,1031번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,This film first caught my eye when I was watching the preview of the movie on the 2012 Diamond Edition DVD of Cinderella 1950 at my friends cabin  I saw this magical film for the first time in 2020 and loved it This fourth installment is about Tinker Bell meeting her fraternal twin sister Periwinkle even though they cant meet each other because the Winter Woods is too cold for warm fairies and the warmer seasons of Pixie Hollow are too hot for winter fairies  Preschoolers could be in suspense when Queen Clarion says that if the freeze spreads around Pixie Hollow Life there would change forever and no fairy would ever fly again  Anyway I love this movie Its basically Frozen with fairies instead of humans released a year earlier Secret Of The Wings was released in 2012 and Frozen was released in 2013 This film is one of the best ones Ive seen of all time theres no scary moments at all so little kids wont complain,6
229903,1031번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,This movie is appropiate for all ages,1
229904,1031번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,You grow out by three years old Ive seen that in younger kids,1
229905,1031번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,It is a very good movie about sisters  Any kid can watch it  No scary parts AT ALL and I am very sensitive It got kind of boring after watching it seven times though  I am more into watching Planes and PlanesFire and Rescue,5
229906,1031번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,This installment in the benign Tinker Bell movie series shows off some serious Disneystar talent as the McClain sisters sing a new song  The reason for the 6 and up rating is only because the storyline is much more indepth than the others so a better attention span is needed to fully grasp this movie,2
229907,1031번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,This movie is better for younger kids   It wasnt very interesting for a 10 year old  The Winterland is very pretty  It teaches one not to give up and to have persistence  It also show that somebody can make a mistake and fix it,5
229908,1031번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,Hi I am M9PIXARs friend,1
229909,1031번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,I am 7 years old and when I saw this movie I really liked it because it shows that family should be together and that sometimes you half to follow your dreams,1
231253,1053번,Toy Story 3,6,The funniest jokes out of all three Toy Story movies Greatest quality animation out of all threebest scripts out of all threeect PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT,4
231254,1053번,Toy Story 3,6,Even though this is my least favorite in the Toy Story franchise this one is still 5star worthy  It is hilarious  The reason I rated this on for 2 or older is because anyone of any age should watch this  If your child cant handle the scary scenes just cover their eyes so they can enjoy the rest of the movie  Overall great movie,5
231255,1053번,Toy Story 3,6,This was an absolutely amazing movie with lots of connections to the real world and very inspiring  However its also pretty scary and sad and some younger viewers might find it hard to understand hidden meanings beneath the character developments  All in all great movie but not for everyone,3
231256,1053번,Toy Story 3,6,Some moments of gambling one very scary scene where a baby twists its head around graphically The most scariest toy story yet Should be a PG,3
231257,1053번,Toy Story 3,6,Third Toy Story is the best but the most intense,1
231258,1053번,Toy Story 3,6,For ages 5 and up,1
231259,1053번,Toy Story 3,6,It touched my heart  Best toy story movie ever made I feel any age is the right age for this  There is comedy thats age appropriate and even my dad loved the film  I even have the it on DVD  The only thing you may consider inappropriate is romance between Buzz light year and Jessie and ken in one scene is in nothing but his underwear,6
231260,1053번,Toy Story 3,6,This movie rocks There are a lot of funny moments and colorful animation If you want to see some of the best stuff in movie history than this is the movie for you,3
231261,1053번,Toy Story 3,6,This is a really good movie  It is also a good family movie  I love toy story  Ther isnt anything bad in it that kids shouldnt see,4
231527,1054번,Toy Story 4,8,Its about demons taking over toys  Its anti jesus,2
231528,1054번,Toy Story 4,8,its a good movie but   THEY BETTER MAKE TOY STORY 5 WHERE WOODY AND BO PEEP GO LIVE WITH BONNIE AND DUKE CA BOOM GETS TO BE WITH HIS OWNER AND DUCKY AND BUNNY GET TO CONKER THE WORLD,2
231529,1054번,Toy Story 4,8,this is a good movie though the only bad thing about is that creepy ventriloqist dummy he creeps me out,1
231530,1054번,Toy Story 4,8,Some people are saying that the dummies are creepy but I love old time creepy stuff please dont judge me  The movie is good but might scare some people  Read the other reviews,3
231531,1054번,Toy Story 4,8,Its okay but I like how number 3 ends  It also is scary  Who would put slappy in a small kids movie,4
231532,1054번,Toy Story 4,8,The movie ended with the toys separating which is unacceptable   I have watched all the movies as a kid to now and that just should not have happened  Im an beyond irrated that this decision was made  If there is ever a toy story 5 it better be all the toys meeting up AND STAYING TOGETHER  Thank you,5
231533,1054번,Toy Story 4,8,The movie is heartwarming and I love it  Forky is consistent saying he is trash and wants to go to a garbage dump which could be portrayed as suicidal  Forky ends up staying and is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO funny Bo Peep is strong and the movie is funny Gabby Gabby ends up being really really sweet the dummies arent THAT scary  I apoligize for the review I first wrote This movie is INCREDIBLE,4
231534,1054번,Toy Story 4,8,Oh my mercy,1
231535,1054번,Toy Story 4,8,,1
231788,1063번,Trolls,8,This movie was fine a little bit of pretty OK humor but what really gets me is the MARKETING Its gone a little a LOT overboard,2
231789,1063번,Trolls,8,Too much sugarcoated scenes but violence lined within the scenes  Good for little kids But boring for older ones,2
231790,1063번,Trolls,8,Personally I think that this movie was a hit  Point dreamworks The main character Poppy is a strong passionate motivated character Now Ive read a lot of other comments about how Bridget and King Gristle make quote on quote Sexual Comments towards each other  But the thing is that dreamworks knew that  there would be multiple parents that would be dragged into the theaters as the price of their young childs happiness So of course they are going to add something  like that into the movie I mean yes there are jokes like that in this movie but they are so stupid that they just fly over little kids head And as for the poses Bridget makes being sexual  I just want to make the point clear that they were trying to make the characters do funny things because its not like youre 5 year old is going to walk up to you the day after and ask Mommy why was that character making sexual poses towards the other,5
231791,1063번,Trolls,8,I think this movie is one of the most kid friendly things Ive ever seen and I mean this in a bad way because some things kind of have to be inappropriate but not to much in order to make kids laugh  And these songs just keep going and I hate them so much  The end of the movie is just so stupid  All the trolls do at the end is make the Bergens happy instead of putting them under arrest for almost eating all of the annoying trolls  I know that a lot of people like this movie but I hate it and I do not recommend it,5
231792,1063번,Trolls,8,I think that some parents should explain to their child what is real and what is not real before going to see a kids movie So i really think that the parents should stop complaining about their child being so scared,1
231793,1063번,Trolls,8,I was surprised to see that someone had rated it 18  I mean the trolls world is colorful and the scenes are very creative  I think it would appeal to a little kid  Yes the bergen  eating trolls stuff can be a bit scary to a younger kid but its not really that scary  My friends little sister watched it and loved it  I wouldnt show it too the sensitive child though  There are fun lighthearted songs and catchy tunes  It also gives great messages  Like why you should stay on the bright side  And that you shouldnt pretend to be someone else Just to get somebodys attention like Bridget did   The only thing I didnt really like about this movie was how rude branch was to Poppy  After she finished singing he threw her guitar into a fire  But in the very ending they become pals  Branch also said mean things to poppy but I think kids would know not too repeat what he said  Other than that the movie is a fast paced fun loving musical  thats colorful and cute,15
231794,1063번,Trolls,8,This movie has great songs funny moments that would make kid teen or adult laugh   I dont get the too much violents thing everyone is talking about but its wrong  the movie it funny and makes you want to get up and dance to the song,2
231795,1063번,Trolls,8,this is a good family movie ,1
231796,1063번,Trolls,8,TROLLS is a energetic and exuberant adventure,1
231797,1063번,Trolls,8,its bad i mean why so bland i cant believe how bland the story is so is another bad dream works movie so you know what to expect,1
232713,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,The movie added shadow magic that is so creepy  Norys best friend uses shadow magic to cheat on a  test  They unnecessarily had romance between Nory and Andres  Pepper was super mean and snooty  If you are sensitive to evil characters you might not like this movie,5
232714,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,I havent read the books but Im pretty sure that based on some of the reviews they were better  This movie seems so much like Harry Potter  The magic school and the different groups in Harry Potter they are called different Houses and in Upside Down Magic they are pretty much the same exact thing  Dont bother with this movie  I gave it two stars because I liked the singing teacher,5
232715,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,This movie was a waste of my time  Good gracious Ill never get that 5760 seconds back into my life  I was never down for watching this but ended up watching to see if it got any betterto be frank it didnt  Best part of this movie is that there are no laugh tracks if there was I may have just passed out  Tons of horrible humor and cringe  At one point she said Thats cool as heck I will never recover from that,7
232716,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,the movie is great because a girl is very confedeint  The headmaster isnt very nice tho  It was scary for a little but if it didnt have that it would be sappy,3
232717,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,I have never read the book but I realize everyone comments mentions how its nothing similar  Nory in the movie is just trying everything to fit in and the whole movie is about that making it dumb  All the the other characters seem to be just thrown in there  Norys best friend the hoy Black magic Its all just thrown in there and has no point in the movie whatsoever  And that girl that introduced that magic stuff to both best friend was stupid  Like what does she have to do with it  So please do not waste ur time watching it,10
232718,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,I think its the best,1
232719,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,This movie is a straight ripoff of avatar the last air bender or the legend of Korra this really offended as avatar is one of the best shows to ever exist Rios off the fireearthairand water thing just makes me mad,1
232720,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,The first part was great It was pretty different from the book though    But it was still fun to see all the magic and characters  The teachers are kind of mean but overall it was great Until Reina got possessed by shadow magic and became a freaky looking shadow monster I went into another room when this happened  I was in the other room plugging my ears when I heard my sister crying  All of a sudden my mom yelled Get in here and turn the TV off right now When I came in to turn the TV off I saw a huge dementor looking thing terrorizing kids on the screen  I am 10 and it scared me to tears  Not the Disney movie I want to see and not the Disney I knew,11
232721,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,The move isnt at all like the books  In the books Reina isnt a character flickers turn stuff invisible Pepper in an upsidedown fuzzie Elliot is friends with Nory and also freezes things instead of making smoke Sage students dont live at Sage they live in their own house in the town of Dunwinddle for example Nory moved to her aunts house so she could go to Sage Academy Sage isnt some closedoff school in the middle of a forest its in the town of Dunwinddle Pepper is nicer shes also shy in the books shadow magic doent exist they added a introsoundtrack to the movie and thats all the things the move changed and made worse  I wouldt bother watching the movie  Oh and in the videos on Disney Channels Youtube channel they NEVER ONCE credit  the makers of the books,4
232722,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,I love the movie  so do my friends  I recognized all the actors and the movie is a little bit scary at the end but thats 1 reason why its fun  whatch on disney now youtube tv ect,4
233706,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,the movie was a  2 hour garbage about some girl trying to save heros and is a bad movieSo in the first few frames of this movie you  see a marvel ripoff where a guy gets 2 swords flying toward him like thor and heros look like iron man and  mt lady from my hero academia Theres even a character named all power who is a ripoff of all might from my hero academia   In the next frames you see a girl being bullied  by a 5 year old becuase she doesnt have powers though she wants to be a superhero  which is an obvuis ripoff to my hero academia then they go  in a ugly base which has the students of ua high school just tweeked by there gender  a girl named guppy has a power of fire and ice and obvuis ripoff of shoto todoroki  and then theres a guy with a power to  get whichever power he wants which would be a ripoff of yayororuz and bakugo from my hero academia another girl who can sing is a ripoff of two charactersuraraka and jiro  a kid who bends his neck is a ripoff of a guy named sero Another kid who is slo mo but is seen digestig an exxesive amount of food is a ripoff of a guy named rikido the start of the movie is basically avengers and a 2hour waste movie  The movie and the ending made no sense and the spaceships were balls of foams with strings on  as if not frustrating enough the ending is just a kid discovering  the aliens were nice and THE END THE WORST MOVIE IN THE PLANET netflix gave robert rodriquez 2 hours to make a movie and 100 dollars I want to point out robert rodriquez is a good filmmaker its just this movie that should be erased from existence,9
233707,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Pretty disappointing   if you havent see the for I guess you can sit down and enjoy it,1
233708,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Its okay I mean I hated it but my little sister seemed to love it I think its really predictable but my sis loves it basically Im saying if your older you wont like it as much as your children,1
233709,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,It sucked  No point   At first when I started watching with my brother it seemed like a normal movie  But then when she was taken from her school to the heroics lab    The CGI sucked  Personally I dont watch movies where kids get tortured where at the end they find out they were only being tested  DONT WASTE 2 HOURS WATCHING,7
233710,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,watch with family members this would be the best movie for movie night ,2
233711,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,I LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED IT It has many good voices and infuces,1
233712,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Cool movie with positive messages all the way through  Its actionpacked and never bores you  It has a good plot and no big disappointments  Violence is very small and wouldnt scare most kids  Though the acting was lacking at times like when the girl starts singing its almost laughable just so ridiculous  Also there is some consumerism as some characters always use iPads apple stuff,6
233713,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Dont watch horrible worse then my sisters nursery rhymes CGI horrible acting sucks and it was so boring I didnt watch the full movie I watched a YouTube review and the plot is horrible this is not some kid version of the avengers it mickey mouse and his friends as superheros and horrible powers dont watch the jokes are so cringey and cheesy,1
233714,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Fine to watch on a family night wont scare kids,1
233715,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,I really liked it  and it was amazing,1
234219,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,This movies great  I feel like this movie is more accurate with the book than the new one  Its a very cute movie with some very interesting scenes  It can be kind of scary times for younger kids but overall its a sweet family movie  Definitely consider this for Friday night,5
234220,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,This movie is better than its successor Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  It shows good messages because they sing songs about what you should and should not do  My little brother likes to watch this movie and he was not frightened by the scary images  I used to watch this movie with my cousins every time they came over for Christmas,4
234221,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,This is a great movie overall  I love the book and the movie but one thing for parents  It only contains one scary scene but other than that great movie,3
234222,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,its not bad my 4 year old sister saw this and she was calm she did not say she was scared and besides its telling us kids to be honest not lie,1
234223,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,1971 Willy Wonka was great I prefer the 1971 version over the 2005 one  Any parentkid that says 1971 WONKA HAS BAD BAD BOTE SCENE11 1 STERS EITENPLUS are just too much of a fing py  I love to reenact the boat scene sometimes,5
234224,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,I was shocked to see this movie was G  G ratings are for pure family movies  This was not pure  Kids are almost killed their is a disturbing scene where the group rides a boat down a tunnel with scary imagery flashing on the walls Willy Wonka is just creepy and more  It was also weird  I liked the Tim Burton version but this was just bad,5
234225,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,I loved this movie so much it is my childhood  This is darker though than I remember I mean the boat ride a kids film A girl almost explodes and a girl falls into a furnace  There probably is nothing your kids wont understand like I did but Willy Wonka knew what he was doing where was Agusuts Gloops seat in the boat  I think 7 and up can watch,5
234226,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,Good movie I watched this when I was seven and did not have any nightmares the night after it  However a couple of scary parts such as loud music and dark scenes but aside from that no violence and fun movie to watch as a family and do not worry it will not give your children nightmares from the scary parts,2
234227,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,Willy Wonka is a family classic its colorful creative whimsical and funny  The songs are amazing the plot is entertaining the characters are full of variety the backgrounds are a pleasure to behold it is just an incredible movie Even Charlie Bucket is a positive role model  It has good message about caring  An only bad role is Veruca Salt because she is a rich girl who wants everything and being spoiled but nothing an issue  These kids doing stuff who was going into a bad game show  Gene Wilders Willy Wonka is way better than Johnny Depps because hes more like a stranger than Genes  Well I like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as well  Yes it is based on Roald Dahls classic book  When I was a fifth grader my teacher let do Violet Beauregard assignment and amp me and my classmates can plot it  Yes she becomes blue and fat  I really wish there was a school play and I watched several videos  The only iffy things about the movie are The implications of Grampa Joe doing tobacco Wonkas dark humor especially regarding what will happen to the children after they break the rules Charlie and Grandpa Joe drinks soap And of course the deranged boat ride  We all remember that and what was going on but for those who do not well Wonka takes everyone on a boat ride a calm quiet Wonkastyle boat ride   which soon enters a dark tunnel which shows images of a worm entering a guys mouth a chicken getting its head chopped off something gross involving a bug or lizard and I dont think I wanna find out what it is and also Wonka starts singing and he sounds progressively more psychotic as the song goes on and by the end he is screaming the lyrics as most of the guests on the boat are terrified  Ok well that went insane very quickly  Though never scared me but these characters especially casts get scared  Nothing sexy stuff but when you look for inflammation like Violet then you may find it inappropriate by Deviantart users because they looked thicc and very fat  I really liked to see the candy garden and there is filled with candy  But aside from those aspects overall a wonderful family film I recommended for ages 7,20
234228,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,Its really nice but there are some scary scenes,1
235122,1194번,Zombies 2,8,This movie is the best Awesome songs and a great plot YOU REALLY SHOULD WATCH,3
235123,1194번,Zombies 2,8,This movie is a masterpiece The actors are absolutely brilliant  Meg donnelly has definitely improved her acting to be one of the best on the film too Milo manheim was as good as ever  All the actors from zombies 1 were as amazing as ever  The new actors were absolutely fantastic Chandler kinney as willa had the seriousness and sarcasm  Pearce Joza as wyatt had the seriousness and the comedy  Ariel Martin Aka Baby Ariel had the comedy and the adorableness The plot was amazing  I dont know why people are saying it was rushed and they didnt know what was going on  I understood all of it  They were probably just on their phones not paying attention  The characters even had character development from the first film The songs are much better too I have had them in my haed ever since it came out The dances are amazing too  There is one kiss ate the end between zed and addison but you cant really see it  zed kinda covered addisons face with his heads so it wasnt explicit or any thing  There was no sexualised dancing or movements like there was in descendants 3  It was still a bit cheesy but its from Disney channel what do you expect The breaking of the fourth wall was a bit weird but if you look past that it is amazing It might be a bit scary for 4 and below ages when the werewolves wolf out their eyes light up and they bare their fangs and claws but it depends on the child  There are no bad role models either so if your child looks up the actors in interviews and YouTube in general they will see amazing young people that are kind funny and good people  Overall film is epic and I definitely recommend it to you,24
235124,1194번,Zombies 2,8,I love this movie I liked this first movie a lot but I think this is even better  The songs are really catchy and I like them  There is some mildly freighting scenes but I really like the plot You will want to watch the first one first or else it wont make much sense  The effort put in to the speech songs and scenery are amazing  A mustwatch for me,7
235125,1194번,Zombies 2,8,Zombies 2 is a pretty lukewarm movie  Its not awful but the acting is just not my favorite and the plot is kind of all over the place  Also theres so many things about this movie that dont make sense like if the mayor reinstated all monster segregation laws then why were the zombies and werewolves still at school,3
235126,1194번,Zombies 2,8,It has quality acting and I loved it  It has a few songs that are really catchy and it has a clever layout and ideas  I LOVED when Addison thinks shes a werewolf but she isnt and in the end her hair glows in her sleep so it implies that she really is a werewolf and in the background its a full moon  I think that the necklace only worked in the moonlight  Very good film and even some parents will enjoy it  All kids should see it but I think mostly 9 year olds like it more,6
235127,1194번,Zombies 2,8,this is my favorite one so far i know there is only 2 i think its cool how Addison is so accepting of all creatures a definite stuck at home watch need,1
235128,1194번,Zombies 2,8,These people needs to learn the definition of zombies  They are dead eating humans that eat other humans not nice zombies  Also there isnt a bracelet to control zombies  Thats so dumb,4
235129,1194번,Zombies 2,8,Zombies 2  the film is amazing  I loved the dancing and the songs they were really good and I cant decide which song is my favourite Flesh and Bone We own the night or The call to the  wild I especially love the wolves and also Addisonwho wants to find where she  belongs its a mystery,3
235130,1194번,Zombies 2,8,I think it is a great movies for kids  Some parts may be a little scary for younger kids,2
235131,1194번,Zombies 2,8,it is better than zombies but i hate that addison just goes with the wolves when shes not one also zed steals addisons necklace bucky is offensive he treats zombies horibly and everyone is scared of werewolves,1
235335,1196번,Zootopia,7,Zootopia is a a awesome disney movie for families it has just about everything you would want in a animated movie mystery action great charecters and it has a great plot  I would really recommend watching this movie,1
235336,1196번,Zootopia,7,Wonderful film Judys personality is a WONDERFUL role model  Interesting and humorous Judys right try your best,4
235337,1196번,Zootopia,7,This moving story tells you about how we should be open to all races and I totally agree  Amazing,2
235338,1196번,Zootopia,7,A classic underdog story Judy a bunny in a world full of animals wants to become a police officer but she instead is a meter maid  After she is told to resign she instead takes on a missing persons case and after solving it she is seen as a hero  There are some sex jokes and there are even a  few references to Breaking Bad but no one under 12 would even notice them,3
235339,1196번,Zootopia,7,From the creators of Frozen and Big Hero 6 comes an allnew original story that brings us laughs love and adventure in this new original film  Judy Hopps is a young bunny with the dream of becoming a police officer despite constant reminders that a bunny cop is a crazy idea  Her wish is granted when she is dubbed the very first rabbit police officer and heads off to Zootopia a multimammal paradise where predator and prey seemingly live in peace and harmony  With the weight of a new case on her shoulders Judy must race against time to solve the mystery and prove that she is more than your average dumb bunny  However in the midst of a shifty fox named Nick her job is about to get a whole lot harder  Disney has brought us a remarkable production that defies stereotypes embraces friendship and shows us the true outcome of perseverance  And after all whats not to like The animation is beautiful the voice cast is spot on and the script is brilliant  Judy Hopps is far from your average dumb bunny  Shes clever witty determined and encouraging  Nick Wilde starts out as a shifty scam artist fox but with the help of Judy he learns the error of his ways and looks past his own stereotypes while assisting her  While this movie has numerous positive messages and role models it has a fair amount of peril and language  SPOILER ALERTS Predators go savage and chase Judy and Nick  There is a jumpscare when a tiger jumps from out of the darkness in its cage  Early in the movie 9yearold Judy is pushed and clawed across the face by a bully fox and later in the movie Nick has a flashback to when he was bullied by other animals  Theres an explosion a train crash and falling from heights  Mr  Big threatens to ice Nick and Judy or drown them in icy water but he changes his mind at the last minute  In one scene it appears that Nick has turned savage and he bites Judy  Aside from all of the violence there is frequent namecalling with insults such as jerk stupid dumb loser and at least three uses of oh my God  At one point it seems as though someone has said hell but they really didnt  The only sex is an animal naturalist club where mammals meet together without clothes its extremely awkward for Judy but audience members probably wont be rattled  Amidst all of this theres a good amount of humor in the movie  Some references such as the DMV or The Godfather probably wont be as obvious to the kids but theres still plenty of laughs in there for young viewers too  There are also great messages about teamwork friendship perseverance antibullying following your dreams and looking beyond stereotypes  All in all this is probably one of 2016s greatest films quite honestly being the 24highestgrossing film of all time and it is definitely worth seeing,25
235340,1196번,Zootopia,7,Good to watch once,1
235341,1196번,Zootopia,7,At first before I saw this I thought it would be a lame animated kiddie movie but in the end it was pretty cute  It has great messages for kids like not to give up  The trailer might turn you off from seeing the movie because it doesnt really show what the movie is about but any little kids will probably enjoy  There is one or two dark scenes where animals are locked in cages that kids who get scared easily might not like  This is a great movie to watch as a family with younger kids,5
235342,1196번,Zootopia,7,Im ticked at these parent reviews  Our 10 yearold couldnt sleep at night  What Your child was scared at a playful acting scene between two characters acting to fight I dont know what kids these days fantasize about but Jesus only knows  This movie is phenomenal best animated movie in history   It shows you that the blacks shouldnt be against whites or vice versa  Were all in this together as America  If youre gonna get aggressive to be aggressive the cops are coming  This is a great movie with all the anticop BLM bullcrap going on  Great message adorable characters,11
235343,1196번,Zootopia,7,Honestly this movie is very good  I thought it was MUCH better than The Secret Life of Pets  Well at least older kids my age might think so  Take your kids to see Secret Life of Pets because for a kid movie this movie is pretty mature  I am nine years old and thought this movie was VERY scary  The animals go savage and act like theyre drunk  Theres a scary black jaguar part when he goes crazy and a animal almost purposely drowns the main characters in cold water BUTTTTT on the good side this movie has really good messages and awesome likeable role models  So before letting your preschoolers see this movie think about my reveiw  But if your a parent of  a preschooler than I recommend you watch this,10
235431,1196번,Zootopia,8,Zootopia was a very good movie  It was funny beautiful and heartwarming  But dont be fooled Adults can enjoy this movie just as much as kids can  Theres even a notsosubtle Breaking Bad reference  This movie deals with subjects such as bullying and racism A big part of the plot revolves around making predators look bad and making people treat them differently  Some animals go savage and there is some jumpscare scenes with these savage animals  Overall this movie promotes friendship and equality,7
235432,1196번,Zootopia,8,There are some good and funny moments and some bad and scary moments  But what really freaked me out was the Savage animal part with the panther and the otter  Seriously I was really scared  I had trouble sleeping  There was no hint of the violence in the trailer  But the rest was awesome and funny,6
235433,1196번,Zootopia,8,I went to the theater with my 8yearold brother and he was really scared because of the violence  I dont think 9yearolds can handle too much violence but 10yearolds yeah  They have the ESRB rating E10 which is similar to PG with mild violence  So it is suitable for those 10 and up  There could be some good messages there,5
235434,1196번,Zootopia,8,It is an awesome movie I saw it just a couple of days ago,2
235435,1196번,Zootopia,8,Note Spoiler,1
235436,1196번,Zootopia,8,Took my 6 yr old girls to this and I really wish I would have checked this website before hand because it was too scary for my sensitive girls   They were frightened most of the movie and cried a little too   The movie is fast paced and its about 90 scary parts   There wasnt enough light hearted or sweet or funny parts to balance out the scary   Over all it was a good movie with lots of great messages especially for what is going socially right now and the spectacle that this election has turned out to be     Its just not appropriate  for anyone under 8 or 9,6
235437,1196번,Zootopia,8,Before I saw it I thought that it wouldnt be great but I was wrong  There are great role models but there are some sort of intense chase scenes and towards the end Judy gets a cut that I had to look away from  although Im a  hemophobe   Overall it has good characters good lessons and awesome music,2
235438,1196번,Zootopia,8,This movie was amazing I want to be a director when I grow up and Im also type 1 diabetic if you dont know what that is PLEASE look it up so Judy inspired me a lot I loved the messages of prejudice and anyone can be anything  However there are a couple uses of darn one use of Oh My God and a couple uses of heck me and my family werent offended but other families might be  Also there were some families with toddlers and preschoolers who came to the theater  I didnt think they shouldve came because there were a couple scenes of savage animals going crazy  cough cough not rating Frozen G cough cough I was comfortable but there was one scene where the whole theater jumped out of their seats but I noticed at least 5 little kids leaving the theater early and 1 kid who made it to the end was crying and screaming Mama Papa in the parking lot  Dont send your little kids to this movie  Any kids who are 9 and older maybe mature 8 year olds teenagers and adults should go to this movie Me and my mom are planning on going to see it again and preordering it on Apple TV,12
235439,1196번,Zootopia,8,I saw Zootopia in the movie theater and the kids there were TERRIFIED  There was a scary for them jump scare in a scary setting  Also there was a lot of adult references but they would probably go over your kids head,3
235440,1196번,Zootopia,8,I saw it at the drivein  My brother totally SCREAMED HIS HEAD OFF and we had to leave early,3
235441,1196번,Zootopia,7,This is an excellent movie for older kids  There are references to drugs and Breaking Bad a tv show for adults,2
235442,1196번,Zootopia,7,Everything was great about this,1
235443,1196번,Zootopia,7,Ok so I suppose you may think Gazelle may dress a LITTLE skimpily but cmon it wasnt really revealing and kids probably wont think much of it  As for the scene where the animals are doing yoga sure they arent wearing anything but theyre ANIMALS for goodness sake   Most kids in the theatre just found it funny  The trailers are kind of misleading I suppose but the movie isnt too violent  Younger children and sensitive older children may be frightened by scenes such as SPOILER when Judy and Nick are chased by the panther but that isnt too scary to cause nightmares  There are also great messages like you can be what you want and it also encourages your children to fight stereotypes and prejudice  It also has many funny parts and the story is quite interesting and engaging  Although there are several frightening bits it is mostly light hearted humour  Overall a great movie for teens and older children about 10 and up as they are probably this movies target audience and also for adults I guess younger children about 7 to 10 may not get some parts but they should still enjoy the movie,9
235444,1196번,Zootopia,7,That was THE BEST movie EVER,1
235445,1196번,Zootopia,7,Zootopia is one of the best disney movies yet  it has great role models and good messages  You should really watch this one its one of the best,3
235446,1196번,Zootopia,7,I came to see Zootopia with my friends thinking it was going to be a goofy little kids movie    I was wrong Zootopia was absolutely amazing and beautiful  It really seemed to capture themes of following your dreams and standing up against bullies it was a very inspiring movie  HOWEVER  I would NOT recommend taking a child under the age of 8 to this movie  The trailers are extremely misleading there are plenty of scenes I can think of that are pretty violent and scary  During a particular scene that was supposed to be funny at the beginning many small children started crying and it was not a pleasant experience for them  The movie was more or less a crimedrama full of action and some comedy for adults  But if your child is mature welcome to Zootopia,9
235447,1196번,Zootopia,7,This was a beautiful movie full of lighthearted witty humor and plenty of sweet and poignant moments  Those saying that this is too scary or violent and sexual need to to put it bluntly get a thicker skin  This was an excellent film about tolerance I could have seen it at age five but gave it a 7 rating because of a jumpscare or two  I wholeheartedly recommend this for the entire family,4
235448,1196번,Zootopia,7,Good movie  Very creative  Sometimes a little scary  A little sad sort of  Liked it very much  My parents and 7 year old sister liked it to  Funny  Heart warming  Definitely worth seeing,9
235449,1196번,Zootopia,7,I think this movie is good for ages 10 and up because it was very intense and scary but it teaches you a lesson  I was very scared when the panther attacked the bunny and the fox  My little sister was so scared that she followed my mom all around the house,3
235471,1번,Mars Attacks!,8,Great cast but strange thing to watch,1
235472,1번,Mars Attacks!,8,there is a lot of violence characters are set on fire blown up aliens head explodes with green blood but it is all done digitally and very easy to tell its fake5,1
235473,1번,Mars Attacks!,8,Some really strong violence in this film Characters are burned by lazar guns to the bone a talking human head is scene of the body with blood the president is stabbed through the back Aliens heads splatter with green goo  Some language to like St AssAhole Prick and Crap  Some sexual stuff to like scantily clad women and rumbling camper van which implies there having rough sex  Also some scenes at a casino Social drinking and cigar puffing,4
235474,1번,Mars Attacks!,8,Trash,1
235475,1번,Mars Attacks!,8,This is a good movie with some intense scary moments and funny moments  I think kids under 8 will be hurt cause of these scenes,2
235476,1번,Mars Attacks!,8,This film is funny as hell  The Martians killing everyone may be abnoxious but Funny at the same time  Features an all star cast starring Batmans Jack Nicholson as President James Dale and also plays some person in Vegas  Other cast members include Glenn Cosse and Back To The Futures Micheal J Fox  And of course Tom Jones appears  Sadly it Bombed at the Box Office,6
235477,1번,Mars Attacks!,8,This is the movie that scifi horror comedy and Tim Burton classic that are all bunched together to make an action packed film that anyone will love  The movie has a COUPLE swear words in it   Also the martians and what they do may as well be kinda creepy this is a great alien movie that anyone would love,3
235478,1번,Mars Attacks!,8,I watched it when I was 14   I understand why my parents wouldnt let me watch it before that   It is because of the scene where the President gets stabbed   That bit is a bit gruesome and may have freaked me out when I was about 10   I loved the whole movie and has replaced Dispicable Me as my all time favourite movie,5
235479,1번,Mars Attacks!,8,Occasional cigarettes are seen  2 characters flirt on a TV show very infrequent moderate sex  Horror is too scary for under 8s  Frequent moderate violence and bloodshed e g  A alien in disguise bites someones fingers off and heads explode  At different times in the movie  A peaceful woman refers to being an alcoholic and stopping her addiction  A crucial seen is a casino in Vegas and a husband tells his wife to  play for there anversary   A man refers to aliens as S word heads  Consumerism wise again gambling occurs and the majority of people are rich  However the film is about teamwork to find a plane this is at the end and a woman is purely trying to make peace in her life,10

235565,9번,Mary Poppins,5,Great classic childrens movie  I had to write a film analysis essay for this movie there are lots of things to praise  Catchy songs and nice character development,3
235566,9번,Mary Poppins,5,Mary Poppins is an instant classic I first watched this movie in March 2020 with my mom when I was sick  I loved it It took me a few tries for me to understand the plot and stuff  I even have the 50th anniversary DVD of Mary Poppins Its just as good as the sequel that came out 54 years later But I like the first movie better  Mr  Banks can be a little stern Mrs  Banks sings a song about the right for women to vote Sister Suffragette Ellen and Mrs  Brill are supporting characters  Bert is a peppy chimney sweep and the 1960s version of Jack The Lamplighter from Mary Poppins Returns  Mary Poppins is everyones favorite flying and singing British nanny thats always prim and proper and is practically perfect in every way  Anyway if you like fantasies from the 60s Id recommend this one for sure,10
235567,9번,Mary Poppins,5,when I was younger I would constantly watch this amazing movie it wonderful even though I do not watch this movie on a regular basis anymore whenever I hear someone talking about it it still brings a smile to my face every time  its definitely a must watch,3
235568,9번,Mary Poppins,5,I saw it for the first time when I was 5 years old it enchanted me right away,1
235569,9번,Mary Poppins,5,Mary Poppins is a great Disney classic  Many people dub it as Disneys crowning achievement or Disneys ultimate classic and its not hard to see why  Ever since its release in 1964 it has enchanted generations of people  Adding to that this film may be one of the more memorable movies of all time  Fun fact I had only seen this movie once or twice beforehand about 5 or 6 years ago and so many songs and so much of the story stuck with me,5
235732,12번,Max,8,Max delivers a great message to all viewers  Really hits you in the feel in some scenes,2
235733,12번,Max,8,This was a really good movie Max was a great touching story There were some sad and violent parts that will make you cry but there are a lot of happy parts too some of those parts make you cry happy tears  If you do not like to cry dont watch this movie if you diced not to for that reason or any other reasons you will regret i  The adventure that this movie takes you on is truly amazing It is also a bit racist and definitly for older kids,7
235734,12번,Max,8,I am not giving 5 stars because it is sad  It has mild violence action and peril just one kiss and language like friggin one sht damn and hell  Just one part a man offers someone a beer  My rating PG mild violence action peril some language and sexuality and brief language,4
235735,12번,Max,8,For a PG movie it was pretty violent  But lets talk about the movie  I loved it  Me and my mom really dont see that many movies together because I mean we like Bourne thrillers but this movie was great  I didnt think it was bad at all  Violence was pretty heavy for a PG movie lol  There was gun fights punching kidnapping tense senses were dogs are being shot villain killed by dog RPGS firing at kids no joke and some language such as D words  But other than that it was ok for kids  This girl beside was surprised at the PG rating  But I had fun with it  Good movie ,11
235736,12번,Max,8,Max is the story of a military dog of the same name  When his owner was killed in Afganistan and comes back home  At first Justin wants nothing to do with the dog until he takes the responsability of caring for it   Max changed him from a bratty teenager to someone who takes responsibility for the things around him,4

235739,13번,Maya the Bee Movie,8,This is a really good movie Its a little scarydramatic but most kids can probably handle this drama  I really love this movie at first I was too scared to watch but it was very funny and good Great message to care about others no matter what other people say,4
235740,13번,Maya the Bee Movie,8,It is a very cute movie  I loved it when I watched it when I was little  It teaches us great life lessons such as bee youself get it   its not a spelling errorand it doesnt matter what you are and how you look on the outside but it is on the inside that really counts The movie has a lot of adventures in it and Im sure your kids will like it too,2
235741,13번,Maya the Bee Movie,8,I think it is for kids 4 to 7,1
236709,51번,Mirror Mirror,3,I loved this movie but it is definitely a PreTeen movie,1
236710,51번,Mirror Mirror,3,I didnt really like this movie  I mean the love story was cute and everything but the plot seems very plain and simple  Al least to me  Fine for kids there is  nothing confusing about the plot  Its very simple  One thing I found annoying was the dialogue for some reason it seemed very very cheesy to me,7
236711,51번,Mirror Mirror,3,It is a great movie although it has a little bit of violence in it  That is the only reason i chose 8 and up,2
236712,51번,Mirror Mirror,3,i tried to watch this movie and couldnt even sit though it all  its so cliche that its disturbing,2
236713,51번,Mirror Mirror,3,Contins some fantasy action and mild rude humor,1
236714,51번,Mirror Mirror,3,This film sends out an importanat message that judging someone by their appearence is not OK and that greed and beeing vain wont get you very far in life,1
236715,51번,Mirror Mirror,3,I love this film Its great that snow white gets to be the fighter for once Snow white is really pretty  ,4
236716,51번,Mirror Mirror,3,It wasnt very good I was definitely dissappointed  It was boring for older kids and adults yet contained lots of dirty humor that was not appropriate for younger ages  Not even worth a dollar at Redbox,3
236717,51번,Mirror Mirror,3,in one point the prince pounces on the queen and licks her facealso the dwarfs will start trying to kill each other with weapons drunk  the 5 year old i was babysitting seemed to like it  this is a very good movie at the end the prince and snow white seal there love with a kiss good for kids 5 and up probaly,3
236718,51번,Mirror Mirror,3,I think it was a little violent but Im a girl and 10 and to me it was fine  I reccomend being 9 to watch  Just because it might be hard to understand,3
236795,52번,Misery,8,I think Misery was a great movie but there is too much profanity  LANGUAGE There are several uses of St  one use of Fk and words like dirty bird from Annie  Paul writes fk in a type writer about 6 times  Paul also flips Annie the bird once   DRINKING DRUGS AND SMOKING Annie consistently drugs Paul and there is several scenes with smoking  Wine is drank in 1 scene  VIOLENCE There is a lot of violence in this film  The movie starts out with a car crash  At the end there is a pretty brutal fight scene they are hitting each other with anvil type things The movie is pretty creepy overall  Annie shows up standing up by his bed when he is sleeping  She breaks both of his ankles  Overall this movie is great and I think a mature 1112 year old can handle it,13
236796,52번,Misery,8,I watched this movie a while ago and I did find it to be a little disturbing and pretty dang unsettling but it wasnt that bad  There was some language as well like a middle finger and one spoken f word and c sucker is said once as well  The sledgehammer scene was also very disturbing and had unsettling music in the background but I say that 13 and up can see this movie and maybe a mature 12 year old,3
236797,52번,Misery,8,Sex 210,1
236798,52번,Misery,8,It was very well written a chilling movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat but be warned this movie WILL give you nightmares,1
236799,52번,Misery,8,This movie is definatly not appropriate for any children under 15 or 14  It is not as much scary as violent  Paul Sheldon as the bones in his feet broken and one of them is onscreen he screams and the ending fight is very violent  Their is also some language and 1 finger but like I said this is not for kids  Reviews on here say its okay for 10 year olds  Definatly not  As far as how good the movie itself is it is good but not as good as the book which kids shouldnt read eathir but Kathy Bates preforms her role very well and plays Annie Wilkes great,7
236800,52번,Misery,8,I watched this movie when i was 11 and i was fine but i was also watching slashers at that age,1
236801,52번,Misery,8,Brief strong violence with some swearing  Nowhere near as violent and profanity filled as most of his other movies  This is an amazing movie thats good for kids 12 and up or younger if violence doesnt disturb them and they dont repeat some of the words because this is one many Stephen King movies that isnt scary,3
236802,52번,Misery,8,This movie was fine but not my favorite  It had some language but it was pretty mild R with only a few F words  The movie does have a few scenes of violence mostly towards the end but there is one scene in the middle that is extremely tough to watch and not for the squeamish  In this scene a woman puts a wooden block in between his legs next to his ankles and breaks them with a sledge hammer and this is the most hard to watch scene  This whole movie is very intense and scary but I think a mature ten cold handle it if they dont see the ankle scene,5
236803,52번,Misery,8,I watched this movie last night and Im 9 some parts are violent but its suitable for 9 and up  The hammer scene was a bit graphic though,2
236908,59번,Moana,5,Moana is an excellent movie There are strong positive role models and even the negative ones I mean Maui become good role models and make up for their mistakes towards the end  This movie has some scares but kids ages 6 or 7 and up should be able to handle it  There is some potty language typical for kids movies but it doesnt go beyond appropriate  The music here is also wonderful  This is a great movie for kids and I recommend watching it,6
236909,59번,Moana,5,To much singing if you hate it when ur kids sing the song for ages the dont watch if not then 10 out of 10 would lemur again,1
236910,59번,Moana,5,I loved Moana  It is very beautiful and entertaining  I recommend for ages 6 and older because some scenes can be potentially frightening for younger viewers  However it is very wonderful,4
236911,59번,Moana,5,I put 4 and up because there really isnt a reason a four year old shouldnt watch this  Honestly I think even if you have a kid that is three or younger itd be fine  I just wasnt sure because there is a part with kind of like a lava fire monster lady thing  She didnt come off as too scary to me although I am 15 so I have no idea how your 2 year old would react to someone throwing fireballs and being made out of lava and rock  Other than that the movie is great Moana is such a wholesome Disney princess Shes got a great attitude and for once I love where the storyline isnt about finding a prince  Great movie and the songs are beautiful  Oh also I wouldnt show your kids this no matter their age if someone in the family just passed  In this movie Moanas grandmother dies sorry spoiler and it is sad  Moanas grandmother dies peacefully though,11
236912,59번,Moana,5,Moana is a movie about a young woman who ventures outside of her island in order to restore the heart to a goddess  It has great messages because it shows how you sometimes have to have courage to do what is right even if everybody else is doing wrong  The great role models are Moana and Maui  Moana is a couragous and brave leader who goes on a daring quest to restore peace  Maui helps Moana along her quest even though he is the one that caused everything to be destroyed in the first place  It has some violence and some creatures and monsters that could be frightening for young kids  There is a lava monster who eventually turns into the goddess as well as a giant crab and coconut pirates with weapons  There are some thunderstorms and lightening that happen while Moana is out on the ocean which could also be scary  It is worth noting that while Moana is a kidfriendly movie most of the female characters wear skirts and a bikini top and all of the males wear just skirts  The women who arent wearing skirts and bikini tops are wearing revealing dresses so you might want to consider that  Some mild language is used but nothing that would be extremely inappropraite for a tenyearold as long as they know not to repeat it  There are a few scenes where Maui tells Moana that she is going to get killed and one where he says that the entrance to the crabs palace wont appear unless he makes a human sacrafice  Moana also says inappropriate things throughout the movie some nearswearwords but no actual swear words  Moanas grandmother dies in the beginning of the movie though it is not shown onscreen  It is also shown how Moanas fathers friend drowned in the ocean when he was a young man  There is also a scene at the beginning of the movie that shows a man being forced to get a painful tattoo  Another thing is that all of the adult characters have tattoos and I wasnt a huge fan of how it promoted tattoos especially in that first scene  Maui also goes to the bathroom in the water and leaves Moana to feel the water afterwards and that part was very gross  If there wasnt as much violence or innappropriate content I would reccommend this movie for ages six and up  No consumerism or innappropriate substances are present  Overall Moana is a great animated movie and is one of my favorite animated movies of all time  but I would highly reccommend it for ages ten and older only  It was marketed as a kidfriendly movie but I see it as a movie more for tweens and older kids,22
236913,59번,Moana,5,Good  Some funny parts like the dart put in Mauis pottyprivate part  And positive models  You have to see this  You might even give it 5 stars Really good movie  Id probably rate it 5,7
236914,59번,Moana,5,Well it is good but I saw a bit of disqusting things but it was only one,1
236915,59번,Moana,5,He was heralded as the first and only WWE member and it turned out he was actually a Hawaiian demigod  His name was Maui and he got his powers from a magic hook  He gave humans many gifts and decided to steal life magic from the island lady  It turns out that was a bad idea and he was attacked by the lava guy  Oops  But then he meets Moan who is a princess from a village and shes like give the life thing back to the island lady  So Mauis like No but then hes like ok so its gucci  But Maui doesnt have the life thingy so they have to get it from a shiny crab man named Tomato  They almost die but then Moan gets the life thingy  Oh yeah theres also an immortal chicken  Then they  go to fight the lava guy but Mauis hook gets broke  Then Maui is like Im sad  Moan is like I am Moan  Then she goes to fight the lava guy again  Oh and the ocean is sentient so anyway she goes to fight the lava guy again  Maui comes back and helps DONT READ AHEAD IF U DONT WANT SPOILERS Then ooo plot twist the lava guy is the island girl but without the life thingy  The the island girl gives maui a new hook cuz he broke his  Moans village gets saved and they become seatravelers again  The end  Or is it  Moan 2 coming to theaters in 1995,22
236916,59번,Moana,5,I liked this film because of the courage this film shows  The music was good in the film and it is very entertaining but the movie is kind of violent so I think it is ok for People 8 and up,2
236917,59번,Moana,5,Moana is great   I liked the singing   There are some parts that are scary  Its a funny movie because of Hehe and Pua theyre so great,4
236976,59번,Moana,8,Took the 3yo goddaughter to see this today at PimmiPlayHouse a place that plays movies that have already left the theater  She was alarmed by the sea crab and asked to leave  I had already seen the movie and obliged to leave because she was crying   I think she was just too young for it  Maybe in a couple of years well try this movie again,5
236977,59번,Moana,8,Moana is really good for any children wanting an adventurous movie with a female main character  There are lots of great songs and I really think Moana and Maui are good role models for little children  They dont give up or at least they come back to face the problem  It was a little scary foy my younger brother but otherwise it is great in every way,4
236978,59번,Moana,8,I thought that it was very predictable but over all it was pretty sweet,1
236979,59번,Moana,8,the movie is ok but on here you cant watch it,1
236980,59번,Moana,8,Moana is an awesome movie Moana Maui and other characters show role models that other people should follow  Also children can get a feel for ancient Polynesian culture  Other than that the movie is curious thrilling and just hilarious,4
236981,59번,Moana,8,your kids will drown in boredom  Oh ya ps the star actor is World Wrestling Championthe rock,2
236982,59번,Moana,8,This is a Disney movie that is filled with bravery   A young girl named Moana sets off on a boat to save her island    She meets a demigod named Maui and they journey and they meet a craband a huge lava monster   They are fun catchy songs that are appropriate for kids   The language is not bad at all but they are some violent scenes Hope this review was good,5
236983,59번,Moana,8,so good great for families,2
236984,59번,Moana,8,Great animation film about a heroic girl who seeks for adventure  Its perfect for kids and families  has great music and good visual  Has some scary moments but nothing too intense   Its one of the best animation films of the year and its nominated for two Oscars,4

237407,69번,"Monsters, Inc.",5,Before reading Id like you to know that I tried not to put any spoilers in my review  Happy reading I recently watched this movie for the first time  I didnt think Id like it as much as I did  The visuals are pretty good  Everything looks pretty realistic  I think it was kind of funny  The monsters may scare young children  There were some insults though  There are some great messages families can have talks about  Same with the great rolemodels  I hope you see this movie and thank you for reading,12

237411,69번,"Monsters, Inc.",5,I enjoyed watching Mike and Sully  go to new places communicate with different characters and  fight off the main baddies,1
237412,69번,"Monsters, Inc.",5,Sorry about commensense media forgot things,1
237413,69번,"Monsters, Inc.",5,The movie is about monsters  Theyre trying to make electricity  The movie was about getting the baby home,3
237968,95번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,I was traumatized when I first saw it and it still creeps me out for some reason,1
237969,95번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,Its a very funny movie that does not need to be rated PG13  I watched it when I was 10 and my sister who is 9 saw it at 8  It has a good message and good acting  There are some swear words and a few mildly inappropriate references but its not that bad and it will easily go over younger peoples head  Its very funny and I recommender for families,5
237970,95번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,This is a great movie for everyone to watch whether or not they have gone through a divorce because it is absolutely hilarious and lets the kids know that even if the parents dont love each other anymore they still love them  I say 10 for language some sexual jokes and brief arguingyelling,2
237971,95번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,This film is really good Im being honest its my 3rd favorite movie behind Schindlers List and Jurassic Park  But just like with those other two films Mrs  Doubtfire is one of the greatest films of 1993 and it does a good job on setting you up in an emotional place  For example there are some times throughout the film where you are probably laughing so hard where you cant breath or some times where you cry feeling emotional due to how the characters feel  Because the plot of the story is emotional which shows a couple being divorced and the dad disguises himself thanks to his brother and its actually a good idea for a comedydrama film  However I can not let this movie go without adding some critique to it OK so lets start with the fact that there is a few sexual references throughout the movie but thats why its got the PG13 rating and a majority of them will probably go over kids heads  Also for a Robin Williams comedy there is a lot of language the website says that there was an F word in the film but I watched the movie twice and I did not hear any F bombs in it  This is a very good movie its understandable of making 2nd place at the box office during the time it was released and this is a good movie for 11 but anyone under than that should definitely have a parent or guardian with them,7
237972,95번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,This movie is hilarious  I couldnt stop laughing  The father of 3 kids dresses up as a nanny to be with his kids  He faces many obstacles that are very funny to watch  A Great  family pick for some good laughs,5
237973,95번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,Every kid of every age will find this movie funny though kids of 11 will probably get the jokes  it is a delightful look at what happens when a divorced father pretends to be a prim English nurse  Some inexplicably vulgar sexual content when he overtly quizzes the mother on her sex life and warns Stu Pierce Brosnan about some of her sex life  Occasional sex jokes but mostly a family movie  Robin Williams is cute and very good at imitations Harvey Fierstein is consistently entertaining and Sally Field provides a relieving gravitas  Definitely recommended,6
237974,95번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,Great movie for families very very very funny  I highly recommend it,2
237975,95번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,I remember when i first watched this movie didnt really understand it but i watched it again a few years later and loved it,1
237976,95번,Mrs. Doubtfire,8,This movie was hallarious but did have words such as motherf  kers  tassand much more,1
238100,99번,Mulan,6,My favourite film of all time been watching it since I was 5 years old,1
238101,99번,Mulan,6,This movie is wayyyyyy better then the remake watch this one instead,1
238102,99번,Mulan,6,Honestly this movie is just amazing all around  Great messages for kids great characters actual drama and emotion and great music  It does get a bit dark at points but doesnt have anything too graphic,3
238103,99번,Mulan,6,The only thing I would object to in this film is the nudity when Mulan is bathing but the men come there too  Otherwise a great film with great role models,2
238104,99번,Mulan,6,Mulan is one of my favorite movies  It shows a strong independent woman who helps fight for her country  I think its great for 5 because it has a happy ending and I personally dont think the fight scenes are very intense  AWESOME MOVIE GO WATCH IT,5
238105,99번,Mulan,6,Its a great Disney movie but its story is misleading as like Pocahontas before it it suffers from being very inaccurate  But I dont blame Disney for sugar coating this movie as the real Mulan committed suicide after her service because she was going to be made a concubine  I will say that other than being watered down into a fantasy adventure film is really good and there is comic relief  Thats a story about Asian people  Mulan is a one of the great role models for children and she is worth for fighting for  She doesnt want her father to go to war like a military and she becomes strong  She takes her fathers place  Also a 16 year old girl like other Disney Princesses such as Aurora Moana Ariel and Merida  Mulan is the first place most good Disney Princess  Though it has war violence like theres too many Hun army to destroy Shangs in the mountains  We have 2000 Huns 4000 of them in real life  I dont know why there is so many Hun soldiers who want to take over China  There is a village called Tung Shao Pass that was destroyed by the Huns  There is high body count you can see dead soldiers and horses especially the poor little girl who lost her Lilo doll  A main antagonist ShanYu invades Chinese castle and he passed away in the fireworks bomb  ShanYu is one of the underrated Disney Villains but Mulans a Disney masterpiece  Some people are not allowed to coloring their scleras because its really painful for your eyes  ShanYu has black ink on his eyes that makes him scary and looks like hes having a night vision  I forgot that he has sith eyes  I have sensitive eyes but I couldnt stop thinking about him when I was 9 and I wish I had to change my eye color with powers  Im so obsessed with Mulan at the age of 9 and I really want to try to watch it  Okay also worth noting that theres some sexual jokes in the movie and a very akward skinny dippingbathing scene in which you see Yao standing up on a rock in front of Mulan  The viewer doesnt see anything but its implied that Mulan did as she tells Mushu that she never wants to see a naked guy ever again at which point a bunch of nude men run past  Has plenty of jokes that might go over the kids heads but will keep grown ups laughing  Even LiShangs back is shown and Mulan gets stunned  LiShang looks so hot though  Lets get down to business to defeat the Huns is going to be acronym for LGBT and some theorists think that Shang is gay or Bisexual  It has funny scenes like the Matchmakers butt becomes fire fart Mushu is being Batman and some scenes are funny  I have an only problem that Mulan is having a big ears and thats too funny for the Disney Princess films  There is also ShanYu is thicc I bet that he may be thicc as Thanos you Mulan fans may find it funny  I couldnt stop laughing Some fans may complain that ShanYu being attractive I dont think so So anyways The Animation is great and stunning great characters and amazing plot  Thats a historical inaccurate but the Disney movie made the original legend even better I recommend for ages 5 or 6  Great job Disney Though I will be 15 to see a release date of live action Mulan it has different characters different plot and it will release Aug 21 2020  Maybe fans of animated Mulan will might be disappointed,40
238106,99번,Mulan,6,So I LOVEEE this movie but there is a LOTTA  VIOLENCE,1

238201,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,This was the first muppets movie I ever watched and I loved it The muppets are one of my favorite movie franchises,2
238202,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,Really Good  Not Much to Say  No Content  Does have positve messages and role models though,4
238203,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,Its such a good Muppet movie as they all are  One of the best,2
238204,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,This sequel is certainly more intense and has a lot more action and suggestive moments then the first  Kids should be older and it will not appeal to crowds older then 13,2
238205,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,For longtime Muppet fans this movie will entertain and excite  For younger children they may be frightened by some scenes but the action is more entertaining than straightup horrorstyle,2
238206,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,It is super good but there are some loud scenes where they are breaking in  and it is a really good movie,1
238207,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,I watched this when it came out a long time ago and it was SUPER scary  I think I can handle it now though ,2
238208,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,This is the worst movie I have seen in ages  Way to scary for muppet loving kids  The person who came up with the idea of this Horror yes I said it  Horror  movie is nuts  Mad,6
238209,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,This is what you get if you mixed who framed roger rabbit with the great muppet caper  Oh its too dark did you read the plot before seeing this movie  My then 3 year old cousin now 5 saw this with me on opening day and she actually enjoyed it  This movie delivers a message about honesty Kermit tries to tell the truth that hes not Constantine,4
238210,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,8,My ratingPG for violence,1
238211,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Mild violence,1
238212,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,This Muppet sequel doesnt reach its high standards as the 2011 film but it is great just the way it is  This movie brings a lot of heart and gags that I am sure are capable of entertaining people of all ages  This movie is good for all ages even little ones,3
238213,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Hilarious Perfect for all kids but some may not understand all the jokes  The reason I didnt give it a higher rating was because I almost fell asleep during the film,3
238214,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,i wanted to see this movie when it came out  i liked the first one a little better,2
238215,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,While not without its flaws this muppet film is a great one with a nice caper plot and some great writting  Though some of the characters are off with Fozzie being dumb the gang not recognizing the difference between a frog and their friend of four decades and a in your face moral followindg the climax it still manages to hold up with some great songs a really good plot and the pairing of Sam the Eagle and Ty Burrell is one of the films strong points  For kids there are some violent scenes including explosions and bombs that might scare them and not much else that would be inappropriate for kids  Overal great film and an improvement on its more human focused predecessor,4
238216,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,My mother took me and my two younger brothers 10 and 8 despite my refusals  The advertisements seemed to bore me and really didnt grab my attention  It wasnt worth the eight dollars per ticket  I understood the humor but I still didnt like the movie  Maybe it is just me but talking muppets really dont grab the attention of an adolescent,5
238217,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,This movie is not as great as the first and money wasting,1
238218,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Not as good as The Muppets which I really adore but still worth watching  It has some funny scenes  The cameo appearances was a surprise  Ricky Gervais was good Tina Fey was funny but for me Ty Burrell stole the show with Sam The Eagle  They were hilarious  At least the songs were catchy,6
238219,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Truly I thought it was good   It has a lesson in it dont judge a book by its cover because Kermit was taken to jail because he looked like the bad frog in the movie also there were great messages in the movie but only a few bad words like butt stupid ect   So truly in think you and your family should watch this movie together   Its great for family movie night,4
238220,102번,Muppets Most Wanted,7,Do you like unpredictable movies Do you like movie that makes  you jump If so you would  love the muppets most wanted  I rate it 4 stars it is good for 6 year olds and up There is some parts in the movie that makes you jump If you are looking for a quiet movie this is not right movie to go to  There is lot of famous characters like for  example Ross Lynch from Austin and Ally and a ton more that you might know   It is a pg movie once again I rate it 4 stars out of 5 star,8
238401,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,I LOVED this movie when I was little and I still do  Its great for young and sensitive kids because the violence is minimal and most of the story revolves around the Totoro and his friends,2
238402,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This is an adorable movie that me and my younger sister loved Totoro is super nice he tries to cheer up the girls when their mom doesnt come home from the hospital and he stands with them in the rain while the girls wait for their dad to come home  Satski goes looking everywhere for her sister showing positive roll models and good messages  There are some little ghost things called soot sprites which maybe be sort of creepy for kids under the age of 3  But otherwise I loved it Didnt know Dakota Fanning was in it either,7
238403,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Despite the popularity of the movie I didnt find it very good  The plot wasnt super interesting but I find its more for younger viewers,2
238404,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Was a bit bored for the first 20 minutes but I ended up really enjoying it,1
238405,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,its awsome but people always say the bath scene inappropriate should not be in movie NO LIKE SHUT UR MOUTH PEOPLE back then people did not have a hot water so they had to heat it up and that took long and was a lot of work thats why,2
238406,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Every time I see chubby bunny rat it scares me  Especially on the cover the way its eyes are opened wide and its half way in the shade And the MOUTH AHHH so scary would CERTAINLY freak out little kids,4
238407,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is a Japanese film for kids and doesnt contain anything bad,1
238408,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,I and all my family LOVE this movie It is great I think its awesome because it has a great positive message and it shows two girls that are sisters that moved to a different place and only with their dad because Their mom is in the hospital  It doesnt show anything scary about the mom being in the hospital because shes just a little sick  Though I do think parents should know is that theres one part where the older sister is afraid her mom will get really sick and something will happen to her and shell die but its appropriate and not scary at all even for little kids,5
238409,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,I feel that this movie is a whimsical introduction to Studio Ghibli along with Kikis Delivery Service and The Cat Returns  It tells a heartwarming story and the main characters are beyond relatable to a pair of siblings  However there is the plot point of Satsuki and Meis mother Yasuko  In the movie Yasuko has tuberculosis and when her condition becomes more critical Mei runs away from home  Some say this scene is a gives the movie a deceptive twist that scared their children and ruined the movie  You know what else is deceptive Tuberculosis terminal illness  You need to explain what is going on if your child asks and ask them if they understand  If you keep this information from them theyll learn further in the future and it would be much more traumatic  You shouldnt lie to your kids because if they wholly believe your lies youll come off as untrustworthy to your kids and it would mess them up further later  So teach your kid whats going on if they need to know  Itll work better eventually  Knowledge is power,13
238410,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,its very very very verygreat its the best movie ever,1
238447,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Very good movie for babies kids tweens teens and adults,1
238448,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Well Spirited Away it looks like youre finally off the hook I have now seen seven Hayao Miyazaki movies with widely varying degrees of enjoyment  Princess Mononoke and Porco Rosso are legitimately fantastic films animation or otherwise  Castle in the Sky is a largely enjoyable movie bogged down with a weak 3rd act and a bloated runtime  Nausica of the Valley of the Wind and Howls Moving Castle both had interesting parts but were ultimately too scattershot and tedious to be fully enjoyable  And Spirited Away was easily the most overrated and unsatisfying of the whole bunch     until I saw My Neighbor Totoro,6
238449,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This used to be my favroute movie when I was little now I still love it many of the characters are kind and warmhearted,1
238450,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This film is most defiantly one of Miyazakis best productions  A great famliy movie experience  Good for all audiences  Spectacular artwork  A beautiful film   Mostly recommended for younger kids  A must for Young anime fans,7
238451,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,I absolutely love this movie  Its a cute story with a deep meaning behind it  Once I figured out the meaning it kind of freaked me out  Still it was an amazing movie with imaginative characters and beautiful animation  Spoiler It had me thinking that the mother was about to die and I was close to crying through it thinking of what would happen if she died in the movie  It was so sad how Mei was  bringing the corn all the way just to give it to her mother  Overall its a really good movie and you should see it,7
238452,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This Movie is The 5th Miyazaki Film I Have Watched Out of 9 It Was Such a Cute Movie With an Amazing Story and Plot  With Breathtaking Animation I Think My Neighbor Totoro should be in the Top 5 Best Movies Ever Made,2
238453,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,Great movie,2
238454,112번,My Neighbor Totoro,8,This a amazing film for everyone Its funny in parts and really enjoyable  Its very creative and almost like a dream the artdrawing is very good too,3

238500,114번,My Octopus Teacher,8,Beautiful docu  Thats all I can say,2
238501,114번,My Octopus Teacher,8,Gorgeous film Really inspirational  I usually dont like documentaries Except for the Taylor Swift one of course but this one is amazing,3
238502,114번,My Octopus Teacher,8,This is an emotional entertaining documentary about a man going through depression who visits an octopus every day and eventually befriends it  Some kids wont find it interesting enough to keep watching but older kids will likely be drawn in  Theres almost nothing wrong with this movie except the depression aspect might confuse some younger kids  Watch it,4
238503,114번,My Octopus Teacher,8,i think the movie comes out special but for someone the movie can be boaring it got one sad part but the rest is him telling about the octopus he have seen  the movie is special and i do recommend it  wow    i learned alot,3
238504,114번,My Octopus Teacher,8,I loved this movie It was fun and more of a documentary but overall really good  My whole family loved it and its usually very hard for us to figure out what to watch,3
238505,114번,My Octopus Teacher,8,My octopus teacher  What a life  I mean you always hear Long live the king  But have you heard Long live the octopus Have you Ok I didnt mean to threaten you  Oh yes I did im sorry not really   Im actually very nice you know    can I break your Ps4 Sooo    I regard this movie more like a documentary  It is pretty tear jerking at most times  It looks like a 1 hour long ad but like one of the BEST ads ever you know  If your going watch this your going to want to become an  scuba diver  For real  Enjoy  Its sad  And sad  And sadder  Enjoy again  No really  What are you reading  I said go  Enjoy  Oh wait  I need to,24
238506,114번,My Octopus Teacher,8,Great movie  For kids interested in underwater life about forests under the water learning about octopuses and how they live their life under the sea  This movie also shows about how octopuses protect themselves from enemies and has zero violence except for one sad part in the movie With sharks But aside from that the movie is really fun and really interesting and will not give any kids nightmares,3
238507,114번,My Octopus Teacher,8,Heartfelt though you have to be pretty rich to literally do nothing but visit an octopus for a year and a half  He has a nice house on the beach front etc  Very good docco for kids,3
238508,114번,My Octopus Teacher,8,My Octopus Teacher is a really coolamazing movie but it gets really scarysad at the end my favorite part is where the octopus got on him   My mom cried  But instead of crying I was laughing inside myself while she was crying  But overall it is a pretty good movie  It was really sweet but also stressful especially at the end like when there was a shark chasing the octopus   But watch it if you can,6
238518,115번,My Spy,7,Theres a lot of violence just heads up theres kicking punching stabbing exploding killing throwing fire heads getting chopped off  Violence 1010 language 810 theres ss btch st dk gruesome things 610 a little gross from vomiting and blood and some mean and good messages but thats all,2
238519,115번,My Spy,7,I loved the movie a lot Even though there were swearing  in the movie it didnt bother me  My parents let me watch this movie With them  Still its the best spy movie Ive ever seen  So Id say give the movie a shot There is violence though like punching and kicking and pushing a truck down a big clif,6
238520,115번,My Spy,7,It was great  A couple iffy things though including how JJ threatens to kill a nine year old and said nine year old is manipulative and curses plus the overall language and violence gosh I make it sound bad but I really liked it   I feel though that if they toned it down a notch it could have been PG but oh well,3
238521,115번,My Spy,7,Parents are overreacting about this movie  This is a spy movie and any movie that involves the government and spies and a big burly man in a serious way is not an ok way to spent your kids time  If a parent watches the trailer checks the common sense review and still thinks Oh a man gets decapitated and a kid calls an adult a dk Well Im going to 100 show that to my 9yearold Then thats just bad parenting  I get it if some parents didnt check how old you need to be to watch this movie but if you actually took the time afterward to write a review on this site and KNEW ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND then dont blame the movie for being aimed at tweens blame yourself for not reading about this movie before you show it to your kids  Again Im not blaming parents who didnt get a good opinion but really man be more careful  Im not gonna do an I hope this review helped Thing I normally do because I am writing this review at 1030 at night and I am very tired  So goodnight commonsense See ya tomorrow,9
238522,115번,My Spy,7,This was a really fun movie  Based on the ratings I was a little worried but it was pretty good  The language wasnt the best but most mature children will be able to handle it  There is a gay couple so make sure that your kids understand that  Overall good movie,5
238523,115번,My Spy,7,It has violence but not that that much I watched it with a friend and her younger brother it has some language but its pretty appropriate if you dont like violence dont watch it,1
238524,115번,My Spy,7,This Movie is honestly a great one I loved seeing a big guy like Drax teaming up with a Little girl  They have shanking stabbing shooting punching and other violence but if your 1011 that wont bother you too much  There is too much swearing for a movie supposedly for 10 year olds  There is uses of Bith Sht Jesus and more but if you watch Action movies it wont be such a big deal If your 10 in my opinion it would be fine,4
238525,115번,My Spy,7,A lot of bad language and a lot of bad fist fights that might scare your younger kids  Also some kissy stuff and flirting and gross stuff like that  Overall there are some good messages like team work and family  There are some scary weapons plus a main character throws a knife at another character and barfs on accident  Although the action might be scary it is actually super sick  Very funny Great movie,7
238835,127번,Need for Speed,8,Not bad but pretty predictable and kinda corny at times  Aaron Pauls performance is great but overall its not the best action film out there,2
238836,127번,Need for Speed,8,Aaron Paul is brilliant in this it was good seeing him not cooking meth with a 50 year old man lmao the movie is a fun pretty good movie I like how there is no CGI used which is great And what CSM forgot to put under positive messages is SPOILERS the bad guy manslaughters his friend and leaves him there and at the end a similar situation happens at the end with the bad guy in the car and Toby Aaron Paul takes him out of the car to make sure hes alright,3
238837,127번,Need for Speed,8,Need for Speed the movie has to be one of the better gamebased movies out there  It has charming characters intense but mostly grounded action and some pretty great moments,2
238838,127번,Need for Speed,8,This movie is fine for younger teens,1
238839,127번,Need for Speed,8,It was a really good movie  Very good story the racing was amazing,2
238840,127번,Need for Speed,8,Good car movie,1
238841,127번,Need for Speed,8,I think this movie is recommended for a 12 but the nudity is not bad just a butt shown only,1
238842,127번,Need for Speed,8,My ratingPG13 for intense sequences of crashes and actionsome languageracy contentand brief nudity,1
238852,128번,Never Been Kissed,8,This movie was fantastic I loved the plot it was invigorating and engaging  Movie does include a scene that takes place in a sexed classroom diagrams are present as well as the classic bananacondom learning activity  I recommend this movie to kids 13 and older due to that one scene as well as a few sexual comments throughout the movie  Any kids younger should either watch with a parent or not watch at all but the movie has got great lessons and can teach kids some good values  There is also some mild drug taking pot brownie but its nothing serious shouldnt be a problem  Also do be aware that there is some flirtation between a teacher and an undercover student the student is actually 25 but pretending to be 17  Id make sure your child is aware that studentteacher relationships are definitely not okay because while this is a great movie its from the 90s so its a bit more lack on that kind of thing than we are today  Overall Id definitely recommend it just know your child and be ready to explain whats okay and whats not,9
238853,128번,Never Been Kissed,8,Overall this movie didnt wow me  I definitely didnt hate it but it didnt really pack the punch i was hoping for  One of the most problematic themes is the flirting between the teacher and a perceived student  Although the student is actually an adult my mom and I were still very concerned by this,4
238854,128번,Never Been Kissed,8,This movie was very entertaining but it has a lot of sex references  Definitely 13 or 12 with a parent,2
238855,128번,Never Been Kissed,8,It a good movie but  there is some drinking  and sx in the movie  I think kids who are under 13 years old should watch it with a parent,3
238856,128번,Never Been Kissed,8,This movie has a great lesson and theme and is very good  The only thing some parents might have to worry about is a few uses of drugs and two people making out,2
238857,128번,Never Been Kissed,8,The main character goes undercover as a high school student and she and a teacher clearly both are attracted to each other even though he believes shes a student  When she announces that she is actually an adult the teacher seems really conflicted and upset  But he was fine with it when he thought she was a minor Gross,4
238858,128번,Never Been Kissed,8,I have to say this is one of my all time favorite rom coms  Some scenes could be a lil iffy for younger viewers like when they put condoms on bananas etc  Language is mild   couple of shts once in a while  Also Micheal Varton is effing hot ,5
238859,128번,Never Been Kissed,8,this movie was both funnyboringinappropriate and just your normal romcom     I liked it and agree that it is a must see but    i dunno     if you are looking for a really great romcom watch Love actually soooooo much better It wasnt as inappropriate as I thought it would be unlike four weddings and a funeral but it is still a bit racy   Id say watch it before you let your kids see it then decide what you think,3
238860,128번,Never Been Kissed,8,My ratingR for mature racy content throughoutgraphic nuditydrug useand language,1
238878,130번,Night at the Museum,7,Nobody,1
238879,130번,Night at the Museum,7,Its a funny film with a few stereotypes about  Sacajawea and Attila the Hun also some mild peril and Larry is chased by Attila the Hun with swords two little guys crash a car into a rock and they presumably died  Also some language like kick ass hell and dum dum,2
238880,130번,Night at the Museum,7,Pros Yay Im glad I watched this movie Now I know more about history the only 2 things I dont like are,4
238881,130번,Night at the Museum,7,This is a really good movie  It has an awesome plot and was surprisingly based off of a childrens picture book that had less then twenty pages,2
238882,130번,Night at the Museum,7,This movie has lots of adventure And a lot of comedy It  might be a little scary for little kids though,2
238883,130번,Night at the Museum,7,This movie was great It was actionpacked and funny and taught you a few facts throughout history in a fun way  Definitely a mustwatch,3
238884,130번,Night at the Museum,7,Seriously CSM Three stars This movie is so underrated  My entire family loves it  It has great characters a great plot and that twist at the end is amazing  SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT,6
238885,130번,Night at the Museum,7,Mild infrequent swearing  A few subtextual references that would go over most kids heads  Some scenes including a scene where a wax figurine is run over and another where a mummy is unwrapped may be frightening to younger viewers,3
238886,130번,Night at the Museum,7,this movie seems a bit scary at first for little ones but it all comes together as a really fun and hilarious movie   It is fun for all ages 7 and up,2
238887,130번,Night at the Museum,7,Night at the Museum is not the best film but fun and good for kids  Warning the Civil war guys have masks on and may be a little creepy  This film is great but not for under seven  The old men disguise as goodies so can be quite scary,4
239241,157번,Oliver & Company,8,I grew up watching this movie  I have lived in a very diverse area all of my life and this movie was always something  I could relate to   As a child I would get done with dinner and beg on my hands and knees to watch this movie   It got to the point that the movie just had to stay in the DVD player  I have seen a lot of bad reviews about this movie  I am wracking my brain as to why  It could be the scary themes represented but I cannot understand why it is such a big deal  A lot of movies have scary themes throughout  I also grew up loving Pocahontas and that is a terribly rated movie  If we allowed are children to watch movies with REAL LIFE SCENARIOS maybe our kids wouldnt be asshole or serial killers  Thank you very much,11
239242,157번,Oliver & Company,8,Oliver and company was phenomenal     one of my favorite Disney movies of all time tied with the great mouse detective there are some kinda extreme scenes for little kids  one where desoto one of the evil Rottweilersgets hurt another where dodger main character puppy gets beaten up in a dog fight    and the adult human is told hes going to die if he doesnt pay his debts,1
239243,157번,Oliver & Company,8,Love the music Oliver and Rita and dodger are my favorites Jenny is great to so is Winston and gorgette is kinda annoying bill sykes AWESOME,2
239244,157번,Oliver & Company,8,I have LOVED this movie since I was pretty little  The plot is a little bit unoriginal and there are some bad role models Georgette is a conniving jealous diva  Fagan kidnaps a girls cherished pet kitten to pay off a debt  Dodger is kind of rude and uncaring at times but changes later  The villain in addition to being a total jerk smokes constantly But just so long as kids know not to mimic that behavior theyll be good  I think the main reason I love this movie so much is the music especially Why Should I Worry and Perfect isnt easy,6
239245,157번,Oliver & Company,8,This movie has emotional elements including a kitten who is alone in the earlier scenes and some scary sequences including two meanacing dogs and an intenseviolent death of a certain character  There is even some mild consumerism including an image of the CocaCola logo some insults suggestive content messages and brief smoking  So its on for ages 9 iffy for ages 8 and off for ages 5,3
239246,157번,Oliver & Company,8,Oliver and Company is an amazing movie Its so underrated everyone forgets about it but its really good  Its funny and it has good songs obviously because Billy Joel is in it it paved the way for the Disney Renaissance  which in my opinion are better than the classics Oliver and Company is not to be pushed aside,3
239247,157번,Oliver & Company,8,Ive loved Disney films since I was born  No really  I was born in 93 and the first film I saw in a theater was The Lion King  I think of all the films I saw in the theater during the first few years of my life The Lion King and Oliver and Company hold the most special place in my heart  Ive seen TLK and other Disney classics many times over but Ive only recently rediscovered Oliver  The status of the film is a bit like its central character  this was originally a very popular film back when it was released in 1988 and even got a rerelease in 1996 where I was first exposed to its greatness but it took 7 years for it to get on home video had mostly mixedtonegative reviews and went from popular to criminally overlooked  In the 80s the dark period of Disney history Oliver and Company was the light at the end of the tunnel and it helped pave the way for the best films to come out of Disney since the Golden Age period that began with Snow White 1937 and ended with The Rescuers 1977  The Little Mermaid Beauty and the Beast Aladdin The Lion King and other films of the Disney Renaissance period the 90s were all created by the artists who started with Oliver and Company  But it doesnt give off the impression of being an experimental film it ends up being a true classic  Oliver is an orphaned kitten living on the streets of New York City  He fights to survive until he meets Dodger a dog voiced by the alwayscool Billy Joel who is initially resistant to Oliver but ends up liking him quite a bit  So much in fact that he introduces the kitten to his group of ragtag stray dogs including the dumb Einstein the smart Brit Francis the sassy Rita and the hilarious Tito  All of them help out a homeless man named Fagin who owns a large debt to a loan shark named Sykes one of the scariest villains in Disneys history  He owns two intimidating Dobermans and theyre both hostile towards Fagins gang  Then when Oliver learns how to survive hes adopted by a little rich girl named Jenny whose poodle Georgette is anything but pleased about  It all ends up becoming a tale of friendship and loyalty thats on par with anything Disney did during the Disney Renaissance  But the tone of this one is very gritty and realistic at points  a shock for Disney but still counterbalanced with happy songs and what not  For example the opening few minutes will make even the most hardhearted cry at least a little when Oliver is simply left alone in a dark and scary New York at night  But the song playing during this scene Huey Lewis Once Upon a Time in New York City is sad yet uplifting pointing towards better things that are yet to come  And that they do  The only other things to worry about are some mildly scary scenes when Jenny gets kidnapped by Sykes when the characters are threatened by Sykes Dobermans and the intense chase scene in the New York subway  Overall though CSM is wrong theyve got the same biased opinion on this as the film critics who havent appreciated it for what it is one of Disneys best classics  The music is awesome the animation is awesome the humor is awesome the voice acting is awesome   so yeah  In only a little bit over an hour Disney accomplishes more than most films of three hours can Just see this one You wont regret it,26
239248,157번,Oliver & Company,8,If you dont know when you see Bill Sykes evil smirk with  sitting on the chair and holding his cigar that expression that looks like Shan Yu says how many men does it to deliver a message That is all I can say However Oliver And The War is the best crossover movie ever created  But I recommended for ages 18 and up because of lot of violence and Elmo is very thicc,3
239249,157번,Oliver & Company,8,I like this movie  Its old cute got catchy music and has an interesting storyline  Alright so the interactions between two dogs was fine to a point then one wanted to talk to the other alone and he it took as    something else  The two dobbermans can seem intimidating  In conclusion a fun movie but children may need to be accompanied if they are sensitive,5
239250,157번,Oliver & Company,8,The movie is awesome and I loved the songs streets of gold,1
239299,167번,One Crazy Cruise,8,With only some mild teen kissing and flirting to worry about kids are perfectly fine to watch One Crazy Cruise  Expect a silly story along with messages about embracing change and coming together as a family,2
239300,167번,One Crazy Cruise,8,This Movie is amazing Cody Simpson in this movie dating Ellie that  was how I thought it would end with a romantic ending LiarLiar Vampire was really badso after I watched it I binge watched One Crazy Cruise I saw Good Ratings on it on Imdb I wish it was on DVD So I could watch as many times I want  Nick Good Job,3
239301,167번,One Crazy Cruise,8,It is a very nice movie one of my favorites,1
239302,167번,One Crazy Cruise,8,My ratingPG for rude humor throughout,1
239381,171번,Onward,6,This movie is about magic and how theres always a little magic inside you  I saw the movie on the TV and it was great  Its about 2 boys going on an adventure to try to bring their dad back in 24 hours  Theyll introduce more characters and events  There are hard obstacles they have to overcome great backup and heartful messages and not too much violence  There is some but not much  Overall this movie is great  DisneyPixar collaborations are great,8
239382,171번,Onward,6,A really sweet story with just the right amount of adventure,1
239383,171번,Onward,6,it was well done funny and had no language or sex  mild action  a iffy comment about a female officers girlfriend  an awesome familyfriendly flick,4
239384,171번,Onward,6,Onward is the best movie of 2020 so far  Though the story is a bit lackluster generic rescue story they managed to make it work somehow  I almost cried 3 times which 1 time it succeeded  One time was when Ian was listening to his dad using the cassette boombox the time where I actually did cry was when Ian was sitting with dads halfbody realizing that Barley was just like a father figure to him and the last time when Barley hugged Ian at the end,4
239385,171번,Onward,6,Its a good movie and I recommend it,1
239386,171번,Onward,6,A lighthearted fantasy story with wonderful characters and powerful messages about family and selflessness  There is some combat but its not gory at all  I would recommend this to everyone,3
239387,171번,Onward,6,I enjoyed Onward like I enjoyed many other Pixar films  Onward follows two boys who go on a journey to bring back their dad for a day  The stakes are high and the movie is interesting,3
239388,171번,Onward,6,Its a mustwatch amazing movie that really surprised me  Its very heartwarming and I recommend it,2
239452,172번,Open Season,8,Natureset animated comedy with scenes that spoof,1
239453,172번,Open Season,8,Id recommend it  Its not every day you see computergenerated characters trampling computergenerated grass as they walk through it,2
239454,172번,Open Season,8,Good but crude some positive messages,1
239455,172번,Open Season,8,Unlike Tarzan 2 This film is not appropiate for ages 26 at all there is lots of profanity like Get off my tree you Fing squirrel and there is the word ass in the film but its hard to see Overall This film is not appropiate for ages 26 at all due to all of the bad language,1
239456,172번,Open Season,8,This movie is watchable  But it has its bits of badnessbut overallthis movie is worth watching,2
239457,172번,Open Season,8,This movie has everything the word CP fart jokes peeing jokes poop jokes horrible voice acting animation story characters everything  Pretty much this movie sucked  The only interesting part was the psychotic huntsman who has a gun and likes to go PEW PEW and tries to kill our notsobeloved heroes  For once I was on the antaganists side  This is an awful example to younger viewers  Oh DEER  See what I did there Because one of the main characters is a DEER Or DOE you not know what Im talking about ,10
239458,172번,Open Season,8,This movie is kinda funny and I think it is a good family movie to watch  The only part that you want to know is that Shaw uses a gun to try to hunt the animals  Other than that I recommend you watch it,3
239459,172번,Open Season,8,Personally I think it has a good story line and that little kids will laugh at the content  the only bit I may find a bit worrying is that they are being hunted and that when I was little it made me a bit afraid  It it OK though in my opinion as it ticked a lot of boxes but is was sad as the bear was separated from his mother and got PUT TO SLEEP  Be careful with your child as you would do with another p g,4
239460,172번,Open Season,8,It was sooo boring Also one use of the C word  Im glad other users caught that  Heres the scene  Boog is sitting on some sort of haylike thing and Elliot is trying to convince him to poop  Then he says Come on start crappin   After that I changed it to The Spongebob Movie  Watch that movie instead,8
239492,175번,"Our Friend, Martin",8,This movie was educational enough but there definitely was some iffy language   Also is this just me or did they draw a six grader like an eighteen yr old  I dunno if its just the drawing style but Maria seems a tad bit sexualized,3
239493,175번,"Our Friend, Martin",8,There was some violence like old reallife videos of police assaulting protesters bullying and an offscreen shooting  A house is bombed as well and black kids are being called racial slurs  Along with drinking drugs and smoking a dad smokes in the car  The language is brief some mean words being called to people and a dad in a car yelling mean things to other cars in front of him,4
239494,175번,"Our Friend, Martin",8,In some of them middle of the movie someones dad is smokeing,1
239814,186번,Paddington,7,funny family friendly,1
239815,186번,Paddington,7,This movie was pretty good But my 7 year old sister started freaking out at the crazy lady  She ran to the theater bathroom and stayed there for most of the duration of the movie  This was AWESOME  But the second movie was better,4
239816,186번,Paddington,7,I really enjoyed this flimbut I think if you are under 8 you might get nightmares because theres a bit of violence in it which could scare little ones But its still a good flim,1
239817,186번,Paddington,7,Beartastic  sorry about the pun it is amazing and heartfelt movie that has funny scenes   It is a movie that all ages can laugh at   Yes there is an evil woman that is trying to turn Paddington into a stuffed bear but there are so many other great scenes that are more memorable than that,4
239818,186번,Paddington,7,Paddington is a fun family film at times but at other times you feel like it doesnt fit that description  I believe this is more of a scare than the sequel that came out recently  Millicent the main antagonist wants to stuff Paddington since he is part of a rare species and she wants him for her collection  This theme is believed by me to only go well with kids eight or older  There was an iffy word as well that probably isnt the best for a kidsfamily film  The word sexy is spoken in a scene where Mr  Brown dresses up as a lady  Paddington does bring a few good things like how Mr  Brown eventually got on board with the idea of having Paddington and the rest of the Brown family consider Paddington true family,7
239819,186번,Paddington,7,This movie is really well done,2
239820,186번,Paddington,7,PADDINGTON is a really positive movie about a family that find a bear and look after it  There may be scenes that are scary for young children but it is a very good movie,2
239821,186번,Paddington,7,The movie kind of freaked me out and made me want to run screaming from the movie theatre,1
239822,186번,Paddington,7,Why is it for six year olds I watched it with my little brother who is three and he seemed to like it  The best part is when Paddington did all those weird things in the bathroom,3
239823,186번,Paddington,7,In this movie there is nothing to worry about  I just love the good messages that the all the good role models,2
239843,186번,Paddington,7,The only parts i think were bad was when the women was flirting with the neighbor,1
239844,186번,Paddington,7,Paddington is a great movie  The only thing I may worn is that even though Milicentnot telling who she is is not meant to be scary she may seem to be a little intence for kids younger then 8  Of course its a meant for family movie  There is nothing inapprocriate at all  This is from a kids point of view so adults may have a different opinion  Great movie overall though,6
239845,186번,Paddington,7,I loved it  Ben Whishaw and the rest of the cast were excellent especially Whishaw as the voice of Paddington  One of the best family films I have ever seen,3
239846,186번,Paddington,7,I think  that kids under 10 should NOT pay to watch this movie There is an evil animal and people murderer who is after Paddington mostly the whole movie  But it is still pretty sweet NO WAY so all I am trying to say is it is too violent and stressful for kids under ten,3
239847,186번,Paddington,7,I think it is great  but there is mild violence so I rated it eight and up,1
239848,186번,Paddington,7,Great Movie 4 Paddington rated PG 5 OF 5 STARS ON Review SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Good,2
239849,186번,Paddington,7,Great movie funny and family friendly  A few funny references to the mission impossible series which young kids may not get  fine for children but Paddington himself is put in a lot of peril being shot at getting stuck in an incinerator and being put in a taxidermy van  The family itself has gret messages and paddington is a funny charecter their is a scene where Ms byrd is in a drinking contest and appears drunk even though they are never shown drinking alcohol  I also think your kids might be tempted to buy paddington books and stuffed animals,4
239850,186번,Paddington,7,I think it was really good because it had lots of good messageshumor and great role models  Kids between the ages of 10  12 may not like it as much although,2
239851,186번,Paddington,7,This movie was great What an awesome story everyone should watch this  There is some stuff sensitive parents may feel is not appropriate for younger children like the fact that the main antagonist is trying to stuff paddington  But nothing violent is shown so its fine for ages 6 and up and iffy for ages 5 and under,4
239852,186번,Paddington,7,Funny funny funny  Cant escape from funnyland  When Paddington went on his bathtub boat was my favorite part,3
239936,193번,Paper Planes,7,Can be a bit sad but it is good,1
239937,193번,Paper Planes,7,Paper planes is a really good film but its sad at times  Kimi and Dylan pretty nice,2
239938,193번,Paper Planes,7,Pretty cool,1
239939,193번,Paper Planes,7,paper planes is the best movie ever,2
239940,193번,Paper Planes,7,The movie is ok but a bit with acupuncture might be scary for young kids  There isnt any blood,2
239941,193번,Paper Planes,7,PAPER PLANES is nearly overflowed with positive messages  I think it is a great film for families,2
239942,193번,Paper Planes,7,Im using this film for a film study at school so I watched the movie for the first time not some thing I usually watch but surprisingly overall I loved this movie now one of my favourite movies it show cases that bullys can turn into friends and your family can be once again your rock if you give them time to heal from their scares,1
239943,193번,Paper Planes,7,Its amazing but it is  sad in some parts  Its inspired  me to make my own paper planes and to give things a go,2
240667,224번,Pitch Perfect,8,This is a great musical movie  I know people as young as 7 watch this but I think waiting till 13 is a better idea,2
240668,224번,Pitch Perfect,8,Pitch Perfect is a great movie that cuts right to the heart but it also has a lot of swearing consumerism and a bit of sex  Very good messages about never giving up  but kids under 11  might want to think twice about it,2
240669,224번,Pitch Perfect,8,Enough said,1
240670,224번,Pitch Perfect,8,This movie has to be my favorite movie of all time  I have seen it over 10 times and it never gets old   The singing and acting is amazing and the movie is over all hilarious,3
240671,224번,Pitch Perfect,8,I loved this movie so much I watched it in the plane and I needed up laughing out loud at so many parts  I feel like the other passengers on the plane thought I was a little weird  The music and dancing is also really amazing  It makes me just want to get up and start grooving   I defiantly recommend this movie for teens,6
240672,224번,Pitch Perfect,8,I am 13 and I loved this movie you have to be kinda mature to  see it there is some language issues but it didnt bother me any   There is at least 2 or 3 scenes were she throws up  But again that didnt bother me  I absolutely loved it and think other kids my age would to,4
240673,224번,Pitch Perfect,8,This movie is halarious and great for a mature 11 year old  Some inappropriate things were said like bich and sit  In the beginning a girl introduce herself to Becca the main character and tells her where her room and gives her a whistle and says This is your official Bardon university rapist whistle  Do blow it unless its really happening  Also there were a bunch of college kids at a party drinking and one girl says that she needs her jiggle juice  One girl admits to having lots of sx  One point in an a cepella riff offa battle between a Capella groups they have categories and one of them was songs about sx and then they started singing about it  That was a little awkward when watching it  Overallthis movie was entertaining and fun to watch other than the bad stuff  I loved it and Im still waiting to see the second one,10
240674,224번,Pitch Perfect,8,This movie fallows Beca a girl in collage who is a DJ  At the school there a five acapella groups and one of then is the Barden Bellas the best acapella group there is the troubles  Then beca gets invited to join the Bellas after they lost a conniption because on of the Bellas threw up on everyone  So then Beca decideds to join and try to them good again  This movie is extremely vulgar and racy there is tons of gay and lesbian jokes implied racy content a scene in a show with breasts visible extremely crass and explicit references about racy content some kissing and some inappropriate gestures  There is also tons of constant vulgar language including 30 uses of st fk sltbags dk py ps  etc  There is lots of underage drinking partying and drug use throughout  There is no violence at all but its suspenseful if ether going to win or not  This movie is fantastic amazing hilarious fun and enjoyable but to racy for teens  My ratingR for strong racy contentnudity throughout pervasive language graphic nudity strong alcohol and drug use and vulgar references,10
240842,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Great comedy has only one bad scene when a man says the FWord about 30 times in a row  The rest is either a light PG13 or a strong PG,2
240843,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Good but smoking and language,1
240844,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Although this movie  has an iconic tirade with fk repeatedly just about everything else is PGappropriate  It is a great thanksgiving movie for somewhat older kids and a very funny movie anytime,2
240845,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Funny comedy just has a brief scene of strong language okay for kids 11 and up,1
240846,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,One of the best comedies,1
240847,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Planes  trains and automobiles is a funny yet sad comedy about two strangers whos flight is delayed and they share a room together and go on an adventure  Ther is a scene with a lot of uses of the f word and more language   through the whole movie  It is not sexual or crude  Must watch,4
240848,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Sure theres some bad language but its not horrible and its very funny and great for kids 10 if you are younger than 10 I recommend you have a parent approval  Enjoy the movie,2
240849,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,As far as I can say this is a very good movie although I did see some adultish jokes I think this is perfectly suitable for kids 13,1
240850,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,Honestly this movie is fine for 13 year olds if you skip the scene in which Steve Martin uses the dreaded Fbomb  this actually would have been a pg movie if they would have removed this scene  The only major issue here is the language,3
240851,228번,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",8,I like how two friends stay together to get to the guys house  It shows how you should stay together no matter what  Thats just what you do,3
240964,235번,Poltergeist,7,This movie is good but has a one minute sequence of flashing lights in the beginning and a really long sequence of flashing lights 1520 minutes near the end  So this movie contains a lot of sequences of flashing lights that may affect viewers with epilepsy or any other photosensitivity,2
240965,235번,Poltergeist,7,I think this movie is great for youngsters who like scarygory stuff,1
240966,235번,Poltergeist,7,Poltergeist has not aged well  It also isnt that scary  The tree coming to life and the goofy clown doll dont just scare like they should  Some scenes work well though  The nightmarish scene when the man tears his face in the mirror is truly great stuff  Overall though not particularly frightening,6
240967,235번,Poltergeist,7,If you can watch Harry Potter it is fine for you,1
240968,235번,Poltergeist,7,Aside from the face peeling scene  in which the effects are quite outdated  this movie has no blood and gore and leaves the scares to the supernatural happenings throughout the film  It is definitely not however for any kids under 1011 as it brings the kids beloved toy into the evil action with the  already creepy  toy clown  It is scary but the parents set great examples because they are very committed to saving their family  A few swear words are included but overall there isnt too much profanity,4
240969,235번,Poltergeist,7,This is the cheesiest trippiest ghost film ever   I know it was original when it came out but now everything in it is clich and poorly executed compared to its followers  A small amount of violence and the parents do drugs but nothing much else inappropriate  Dont watch this film for entertainment  I guess its worth watching if you want to see the inspiration behind better ghost films such as insidious and the conjuring  25 stars,6
240970,235번,Poltergeist,7,Poltergeist is a family horror movie that is fairly scary  The violence isnt too bad but in one particularly gross scene a man rips his face off and reveals his bloody skull  The scene is in the mans head which could make it a little less frightening  The family is fearless and strong in the face of danger and will stop at nothing to bring back their daughter from the Other Side  They can teach kids to always work for what you want and dont give up  The swearing is fairly moderate with a few cases of btch st damn and hell  Overall this movie should be suitable for a 10 yo child,7
240971,235번,Poltergeist,7,Steven Spielberg classic   Good but scary,2
241165,239번,Ponyo,6,I just watched this movie with my little sister today  We both loved it and Im 14 It was really cute and I love Miyazakis movies  Studio Ghiblis artwork and animation is beautiful and amazing  Even if you think youre too old for it go see it anyway you wont be disappointed,5
241166,239번,Ponyo,6,This Movie is My Fav Movie Ever It Made Me Love Anime Now I Watch Fruits Basket Toradora and Other Animes all Because of This Movie and I Watched When I Was 6 and Became an Instant Miyazaki Fan  I Really Love This Movie,3
241167,239번,Ponyo,6,A great movie Mostly for younger kids but your older ids can still watch it and I dont now how they couldnt love it,2
241168,239번,Ponyo,6,I am a huge fan of Studio Ghiblis films  The animation is fantastic and the plot is very cute  I dont know why people are having a cow over the breastfeeding line though because THATS WHAT THEYRE FOR  Its better for kids to learn here instead of school right Anyways yeah I love all of Mizayakis works and this is definatley a good movie,5
241169,239번,Ponyo,6,Firstly let me get one thing clear this wasnt a bad film  I actually think its a good opportunity for family members to come together and watch a friendly film with the kids  Its cute and strange definitely  visually breathtaking  These are all very good things that keep kids enlightened and entertained But for the most part Ponyo is simply a story about a little fish girl who falls in love with a human boy and they spend the entire movie acting cute while the world ends  There are two points I need to address here one being the storyline is just fine for kids but for adults it could get boring  I mean all it really is is this adorable fiveyearold love story which to be honest with you isnt overwhelming  But what about the world ending you ask isnt that overwhelming That is what I am going to address in my second point  The whole issue with the world ending I think that was just Hayao Miyazakis attempt to throw some massive adventure in there and to tell you the truth I think he COULD have done better  The end of the world as we all now is a major deal  However the people in the movie treat it as a minor inconvenience as if they hadnt just lost all their homes and possessions  Also nobody even questions why all this is happening or why there are frightening ancient fish underwater  They simply go along with it which I gotta say is the very thing that makes this movie underwhelming  Its underwhelming people put in and overwhelming situation and when that happens you KNOW the situation is going to be a whole lot more bland than before  So in itself Ponyo is a memorable film mostly for its quirkiness and nonstop adorableness  Seriously the cutsey moments in this movie are too much to bare  This paired with the fantastic animation is why most people tend to see Ponyo as a masterpiece  With all this in mind Pony now seems a bit overrated to me  I mean sure its a pretty good movie except for the story and it did its job well as a kids film  But theres allot of waiting and once I saw Ponyo the second time I fell asleep halfway through  Some things parents need to know This movie is perfect for kids  Its not scary or spooky its just different and strange but sometimes people mix up the two  Ponyo is a good film for all ages Most of the time,24
241170,239번,Ponyo,6,I love this movie to death I remember going to theaters watching this with my mom in the summer time  This is a great movie for little kids but they might get a funny feeling watching the kind of animation  I suggest this for 9yrs and up but you can let your children watch it  When I was 5 I liked anime a little bit  But now Im a lover of anime Watch this with your kids its a must see In the summer time when it is raining outside I go watch some anime movies or some shows and if my big brother isnt busyhe watches anime too  Me and my brother are freaks of anime movies and shows  Try and do that with your family,10
241171,239번,Ponyo,6,great movie,1
241391,254번,Princess Mononoke,8,I would say that the creepiest things in the movie were the demons  both were covered in wormssnakes  there is lots of violence even though the main character kind of uses violence as a last resort  2 peoples heads are shot off of their bodys using arrows  and there is lots of blood  there is some profanity I completely loved the movie,6
241392,254번,Princess Mononoke,8,Beauty meets violence in this gorgeously crafted anime movie  Ashitaka is a young prince in a faroff village protecting his people with his life along with his trusty elk Yakul  When he is inflicted with a terrible demons curse he sets out on an epic adventure to find his true self lift the curse and save the forest  But into his midst comes a mysterious princess known as Princess Mononoke  This is probably one of Hayao Miyazakis greatest  and more violent  movies  The animation is absolutely breathtaking Miyazaki can craft anything from an agile red elk to a sparkling tranquil forest to a demongod larger than an elephant  But watch out for graphic violence  SPOILER ALERTS At the beginning of the movie Ashitaka and his friend are attacked by a horrible demon that appears to be a boar covered in swirling worms  When Ashitaka kills it the flesh disappears from its body and the bloody skeleton is left behind  However Ashitaka is left with a steaming wound that the elders say is destined to kill him  Kids might be upset when Ashitaka has to leave the only home hes ever known to lift the curse upon him  At another village Ashitaka witnesses a bloody massacre in which his wounded arm swells and seems to has a mind of its own it causes him to accidentally cut off someones arms and another persons entire head  In a heavy rainstorm Lady Eboshi and her men fight a wolf one person shoots the wolf and sets it on fire briefly and it falls off a cliff  Later we see Princess Mononoke usually called San come into the story for the first time she finds the old wolf on the banks of a river and she sucks and spits out the blood from the wolfs bullet wound her mouth becomes covered in blood  After Ashitaka arrives in Irontown the central village of the story San attacks the citizens of Irontown along with her two wolfs there is a sword fight between San Ashitaka and Lady Eboshi  When Ashitaka knocks Lady Eboshi unconscious he is shot through the stomach but continues to advance through the village without any apparent struggle  An ancient boar called Okkoto becomes covered in the same swirling worms as the boar at the beginning of the movie and San becomes trapped within the worms on his face Okkoto appears to become a demon and San almost becomes one too  One of the main conflicts of the story is based on the keeping of the peace between the humans and the forest  However not all want it to be that way  Lady Eboshi strives to kill the Forest Spirit and give the head of the creature to a man named Jigo who says he will help her people in return  She succeeds in cutting off the head of the spirit of the forest the rest of the spirits body turns into a creature made of dark lifelike ooze that kills a living thing instantly upon contact  Lady Eboshis arm is then bitten off by a wolf  These are just a portion of the many violent scenes of this movie all of which are fairly bloody and gory but are still amazing and entrancing to watch  Language includes damn piss and bastard but there is really no sex  For those who are afraid of blood or watching peoples limbs get ripped from their bodies this will be too scary andor violent  But for those who are huge Miyazaki fans and are okay with the violence bloody and all it will be an actionpacked joyride that they wont soon forget,26
241393,254번,Princess Mononoke,8,OK first off this movie is violent  People are killed and peoples limbs fall off  The PG13 rating is right,3
241394,254번,Princess Mononoke,8,What you need to know is I hate gory movies although this movie did have some gore All the violence in the beginning is pretty quick and at some parts comical  near the end it gets pretty gory but is still manageable  There are a lot of people on hear saying they showed it to their six year old Its rated pg13 so you dont show it to youngsters I mean really cmon people the front has a picture of a girl with blood on her face and guy with a sword and scar  If you cannot handle gore whatsoever dont watch this  If you can handle some and not get scared watch it right now it is so good,5
241395,254번,Princess Mononoke,8,It is violent but not too violent  when i first watched it i was 8 and i loved it,2
241396,254번,Princess Mononoke,8,An absolutely amazing movie with intense action fair amounts of blood an amazing soundtrack and an amazing story that you wont forget anytime soon  This movie is amazing and a great choice for families that enjoy Japanese movies and anime,2
241397,254번,Princess Mononoke,8,The animation and story is very unique and focuses on the story of a teenage boy trying to lift a curse caused by a hateful demon  It discusses how violence and hatred brings trouble to people and how humans are destroying the environment with their greed  A more mature and significantly better animated Fern Gully  I would NOT recommend this to anyone who doesnt like blood or body gore there is only 23 scenes with this but I found it uncomfortable to watch  I also noticed a few cuss words ass a few times damn 34 times and bastard once,5
241398,254번,Princess Mononoke,8,This is the sequel to the 1995s hit The Flying Castle but this 1 adds more gory violence and graphic killing with lots of gore  This drama has tons of bloodygraphicdisturbing and shocking violence characters are slicedstabbedshotblown to bits etc  There are also lots of gory images including a girl eating a wolf and spitting the blood from her mouthblood is seen splatteringlots of pools blood and some very graphic woundssome disturbing and very gory content  There is no swearing or racy content but there is some drinking and flirting  This sequel is epic and very thrilling but due to strong bloody violence its and iffy choice for teens  My ratingR for bloody and graphic violence throughoutdisturbing contentimagesand intense sequences of gruesome and bloody images,6
241671,264번,Puss in Boots,7,Its a swashbuckling adventure that features the irresistible warrior cat,1
241672,264번,Puss in Boots,7,It is hilarious but has some rude humor that adults will get but not little kids  It has some suitable lessons like trust and the bond between friends  My family enjoys it every time but personally I think it is best if whoever is watching it is at least 7 or 8,3
241673,264번,Puss in Boots,7,This show is very good but I think the death character in this movie is too scary,1
241674,264번,Puss in Boots,7,I loved everything about the movie most movies have a pros and cons list but I cant think of anything negative to say about this The pacing was good the villan atchually scared me and the story was easy to understand I didnt come out of the theater with questions as usual  I am putting 5 and up because they do reference curse words by bleeping the characters and cutting to another scene,5
241675,264번,Puss in Boots,7,Funny sweethearted take on classic hero,1
241676,264번,Puss in Boots,7,I have seen the 2011 SpinOff and it is one of my favorite DreamWorks SpinOffs next to Penguins Of Madagascar Guys its Puss In Boots thats the way he is you watched Shrek and it was inappropriate and Puss In Boots is a part of the Shrek Franchise,1
241677,264번,Puss in Boots,7,Contains cartoonish fantasy violence throughout not many sexual content apart from Puss being coo over his flirtatious sidekick little to no profanity  There is a gag about how catnip mimics marijuana and how it cures Puss glaucoma,2
241678,264번,Puss in Boots,7,Wella movie about Puss in Boots  It doesnt work 100with the wrting being somewhat weak and the new characters unmemorablebut at least Antonito reprises his role and the animation is good,2
241679,264번,Puss in Boots,7,This movie should always have a five star rating   Its awesome Many people may like it,3

241825,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,i love it ,1
241826,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,Slighty swearing no nudity slighty violence but too much consumerism theres fortniteinstagram ebay youtube GTA disney DC Marvel and more Great role models,2
241827,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,I think this movie is very creative and good for younger kids   but its kind of cheesy for older kids,2
241828,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,Disney has out done itself by going out to explore the internet world This is an amazing sequel although I prefer it to be watched by kids 10 and above due to high violence and the internet has some crazy stuff not for kids  It also depicts the strength of friendship,3
241829,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,AWESOME NEED TO WATCH,1
241830,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,Ralph Breaks The Internet has quite a bit of consumerism and most people wont leave without knowing the name of one of the companies shown in the film   While traveling into the Dark Web we do encounter many scary viruses and glitches though    The movie is still okay for young audiences though,3
241831,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,The movie itself was pretty solid with it emphasizing about tech today and using terms and and tips to help kids today use the internet  The thing is that the plot is confusing  SPOILERS AHEAD,4
241832,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,Sequels are supposed to be more mature and darker but this film  Its more friendlier and better  I love how every single moment of this movie especially when they reach the internet because almost everything they saw in the internet was real except that Google was Mr Knowsmore and Buzzztube was YouTube  I 100 recommend to everyone except preschooler because this movie has a lot of very mild swearing and the virus scene is very scary for younger or sensetive kids  Look I watched this when I was 11 I was still scared when Ralph became a virus  So dont worry,6
241833,280번,Ralph Breaks the Internet,8,really good,1
241894,282번,Ratatouille,6,Cute rat tale has some peril and potentially scary moments,1
241895,282번,Ratatouille,6,Some people might say that the characters in Ratatouille are unrealistic but actually the characters include a lot of true and dramatic character traits like rudeness and jealousy  Not only are the traits in the characters is fabulous but also the storyline is great  The story started out with the main character introducing himself to us then as the rat family got exposed they were forced to the drain which led them to Paris  In Paris he succeeded in his dreams  I like how the story included the dish Occitan Occitan is a French Provenal dish of stewed vegetables  About the theme main lesson in a story there was a man that kept jumping out to tell the rat not to give up or stop his dreams  For example sometimes in life risking your dreams or doing something unexpected can lead to a successful ending,7
241896,282번,Ratatouille,6,I  pirated this movie and still want a refund,1

241900,282번,Ratatouille,6,A classic that I think is great for anyone,1
241901,282번,Ratatouille,6,I was watching this movie and it was fine until I heard someone say Ratatooing here and also one problem is that theres no Mickey Mouse here  Education Value has none there is a some drinking and it says Ratatooing a lot  It catches Atai Omurzakov dancer man as WALLE  And yeah I recommend for 22,3
242121,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,i love this movie every time i watch i i pick up on something new that just adds to the story and makes it so much better and its so interesting,1
242122,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,so let me get this out first  I couldnt really focus on the movie so my review might have mistakes,2
242123,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Its fine  Nothing I personally enjoyed  The animation and voice acting do make it bearable  Its not the best of Disneys animated movies but its perfectly serviceable family entertainment  I didnt have that much interest in it but Im sure others will,5
242124,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Raya and the Last Dragon was another fun heroine movie from Disney I liked it but Raya looks just like Moana and the storyline is kind of like it too  Overall its worth it to watch it though  I think kids 67 and up are totally ok to watch it,4
242125,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Good ol movie  Has good action scenes and messages but heres a quick tip for parents Sometimes they imply swear words like a and b,2
242126,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,I dont want to pay 30 plus my existing Disney Plus subscription  Aquafina is awful and so is her design  It looks like a 4 year old picked up crayons and drew her mom a blue dragon  I dont understand how Disney went from Moana to Rays and the last dragon  It is unfunny and cringe worthy  I dont know why this film attempts to immerse you in the time period when you have Aquafina making a joke about being in a school project  Why was this in the movie Maybe she is a time traveler like the genie  I normally dont get this mad over Disney movies but I am mad  I payed 30 dollars and wished I got that money back  I dont underestimate Disneys talent because this movie is gorgeous but that doesnt fix the multiple problems  Im sorry Disney but you need to get your act together  There is a positive message hidden behind the lackluster jokes but it is covered in Disneys blockbuster coat,13
242127,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Positive messages a bit tense at moments,1
242128,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Raya and the Last Dragon is a great film  I really hoped this film could live up to my expectations and for the most part it did  It feels pretty good to have a good Disney film again considering I hadnt loved some of their newest films  Im not sure if its worth 30 to watch it on Disney but the decision is up to you,4
242129,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,this movie is such a good family movie  People get turned into statues by an evil spirit thing but thats as bad as it gets  it is very funny there is some fighting there is no swearing and the main charicters are great role models,3
242130,283번,Raya and the Last Dragon,8,Great,1

243770,361번,Scooby-Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur,6,Amazing,1
243771,361번,Scooby-Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur,6,I think this was too scary for younger kids   A good movie for tweens but nothing younger,2
243983,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,Its appropriate I liked how it included Rich Brian and 88 rising,1
243984,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,This was a great way to get back to theaters  This movie lived up to my expectations  The whole time my heart was racing it could have been the butter on my popcorn but that doesnt matter  The fight choreography is stunning the writing is fine as wine in the summertime  The costumes are to the nine and the visual effects are breathtaking  I highly recommend this movie,6
243985,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,great fight scenes and amazing cgi safe for most kids and even toddlers to watch,1
243986,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,very good movie with good messages and themes  super funny movie that the whole family should enjoy,3
243987,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,There is some language a few uses of st and one mouthing of fk  Lots of martial arts violence  Cast is mainly Asian  Movie has great messages,4
243988,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,Parents in my opinion the only thing you really need to worry about is when someone  says the v word once  However this is only based on your childs maturity,2
243989,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,I think kids should see this to know that there are all sorts of heroes not only white americans  Great ChineseAmerican tale amazing storyline and phenominal graphics  A joke about a ladys genitals and BS jacka sht hell damn and btch were repeated a lot throughout the movie so watch out for that  Amazing messages but a lot of violence and gore  A man was kicked in the testicles once  Otherwise amazing,6
243990,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,VIOLENCE Shangs father built quite a reputation after his wife died by killing those responsible  But it didnt end there  He continued his brutal behavior for another 10 years before his wife started calling to him asking him to safe her  Spoilers The voice was not his wife but a mimic created by the ancient beast called the Dweller  Similar creatures end up attacking a village sucking the souls from its occupants  To describe the process the creatures grab the victim and absorb a glowing orb from their body their soul  Other fighting sequences in the movie are mainly martial arts  People are stabbed punched and kicked in all sorts of ways  Some assassins fall from tall scaffolding and some fall off cliffs,9
243991,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,I loved this movie It got a little confusing at the end but it was still amazing  It was also very funny   If you are worried about inappropriate stuff the girl Katy references vagina 2 times    when they are talking abt childbirth and abt changing names normal name Gina to slang gina I love this movie though,6
243992,385번,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,7,SHANG CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS  The movie was EXCELLENT and for me i am a huge huge huge MARVEL fan and for me it is on of the best some languege Like S and B and stuff like that violence is average for 10 and over either then that you should approve to watch the movie GREAT MOVIE,2
244039,387번,Sharknado,8,I think Sharknado is an awesome movie but there is a lot of vilonse and suffering between character  There is also a few kissing sense  Also the language is very harsh  Other than that Sharknado is a great movie There is also a great role model,5
244040,387번,Sharknado,8,This is a great BMovie for ages 10 and up  The whole plot of the movie is laughing as people are killed by sharks that fall out of the sky but its so bad that its good  The only thing to worry about is violence and gore which looks like a video game  So if your kids can handle Call of Duty theyll be fine  This movie is great for a movie night,5
244041,387번,Sharknado,8,This movie is so funny It is literally the worst movie I have ever seen which makes it that much better You should watch it Sharks start swarming in a hurricane and rain down on people  Everything is fake and really hilarious  The main characters are comical and sometimes a little stupid  A lot gets destroyed and a few people die  But its obviously fake so it will not scare most people  However dont show it to your little kids,9
244042,387번,Sharknado,8,This movie interested me because I like shark stuff  There is plenty of violence in this movie  Sharks eating people or even just biting off their legs or their arms  There is a tornado with sharks inside and they have to find a way to survive  A girl is inside a shark and it shows you a man cutting the shark and taking her out of it  There is no sex besides kissing and the language is not strong  People say shit and hell and that is all  There is some drinking in this movie but you should not be worried about that  Nothing happens after they drink they do not get drunk or anything like that  I think that this movie is okay for kids ages 14 and up because most of the deaths are gruesome  WATCH IT IF YOU ARE 14 AND OLDER THOUGH BECAUSE IT IS AN AMAZING MOVIE,11
244043,387번,Sharknado,8,This movie is amazing  There is a lot of blood and I mean a lot  But the blood looks fake   Their is some bad language but I think that a twelve year old kid should be allowed to watch it  The effects are not well done at all  If they were that would be a different story,6
244044,387번,Sharknado,8,I hate this movie sooooooooooooooooooooooooo much I love it   Amazing  So funny  With the scene with the school bus look at the name on the side of the bus,4

244363,392번,Shazam!,8,There are some inappropriate staff for young kids but beside that its really funny  It is also a little bit scary but only for young kids  You should really watch that,3
244364,392번,Shazam!,8,I have seen many scary movies in my life but this one literally gave me a painc attack  The monsters are scarier than IT the clown the violence is insane and there is a scene where the whole family walks out of a strip club because Shazam teleported them there  This movie should NOT be 12 it should be for very mature teens  I will never ever see this movie again and neither should any other kid,4
244365,392번,Shazam!,8,I went to see it with my mum and two brothers8 14 and was generally happy with what I saw the boardroom scene is a bit intense for some children but I see so many Asia Ltd over reacting about it they should have done more research  Theres a strip club seen witch is questionable but understandable at the same time  Great movie,3
244366,392번,Shazam!,8,It was a great funny movie but there were things that were really scary and a lot of violence me and my friend called the creatures tongue gremlins because they had gnarled warted drooling tongues and they were called the seven deadly sins from Pandoras box in Greek mythology and the bible they were really scary and there was a lot of high pitched screaming and people turning to ash which was unsettling it was a very scary movie but nothing  inappropriate,1
244367,392번,Shazam!,8,Okay so Im 9 this year a Gifted Education Program kid studying in Singapore  I understood the plot very well and although there was a bit of violent parts inside the movie it was not too scary  However you can still watch the movie if you are aged 7 and below just skip the first part and pretend to go to the toilet for about 15 mins then return back to the cinema  For the rest do NOT skip any part of the movie even if it was scary go to the toilet only if you want to pee or poo  I will tell you the 2 scary parts in this movie,5
244368,392번,Shazam!,8,Shazam is great  I was no tscared of the boardroom scene because there is no blood at all and cant see much killing later because its all behind a frosted glass  I did not notice any sex in the movie there is  no kissing at all  I thought the characters FreddyBilly and Shazam are funny people that probably want to know about superheros and know have there own superhero  I liked the movie so much that I watched it twice  I recommend  my friends and other kids to watch the movie,6
244369,392번,Shazam!,8,WARNING SPOILERS   I can see why some people might enjoy this film the humour the superheroes the action  But honestly its way too scary for children,3
244370,392번,Shazam!,8,Its a very good film with a little bit of violence and swearing BUT it has got some positive messages  I think kids can watch it D,2
244551,403번,Shrek,8,I personally love the movie along with thousands of other people who had the blessing of seeing the classic movie but there is a bit of cussing and inside jokes that some people might understand  Most kids at the age of 8 has at least heard swearing somewhere before so thats why I think 8 is the appropriate age to see Shrek  Children learn about puberty somewhere around the age of 8 so I think its safe to say that it is an appropriate age to see Shrek,3

244557,403번,Shrek,8,I saw this movie when I was 8 it was on Cartoon Network though never watched the whole entire thing I noticed something inappropriate for a kids film  A PG Rating but well but before that I never heard those until I noticed one  then I watched a video of the cursing scenes with occasional Mild profanity as its used a whole lot While the violence or anything inappropriate isnt too much the Language is im giving this a PG13 Rating Due to The Language,1
244558,403번,Shrek,8,I loved this and still do  Great movie,2
244559,403번,Shrek,8,Its fine but    Theres a bit of swearing but there great messages and role modles  So i would belive this is for kids age 11 and up,2
244622,403번,Shrek,7,When I first watched this film I was a year old and my parents say I used to love it  I would watch shrek 3 times a day inless they had to go out  My parents couldnt believe it  Thats probably why they told me,4
244623,403번,Shrek,7,While simultaneously embracing and subverting fairy tales the irreverent Shrek also manages to tweak Disneys nose provide a moral message to children and offer viewers a funny fastpaced ride,1
244624,403번,Shrek,7,this movie was made before i was born but i still love it but also be warned that there is a lot of mild swearing for a kids movie but kids probably wont understand it,1
244625,403번,Shrek,7,I didnt see this movie when I was young unlike most other kids  And ive just recently watched it  I still found many scenes funny as the jokes appeal to almost every age  Unlike that garbage movie Alvin and the chipmunks,4
244626,403번,Shrek,7,Has great messages and a satisfying story,1
244627,403번,Shrek,7,I thought that Shrek had a great story and was well written  However there are uses of ass damn and hell  Also Princess Fiona shows a bit of cleavage  Nothing too concerning but heads up for parents,4
244628,403번,Shrek,7,I know I watched this a lot when I was little and I watched it on long road trips but I just watched it again with my little brother age 5 and I am starting to notice this movie has multiple adult jokes for older kids  Again I didnt remember anything from when I was younger so it should go over their heads  Swears said damn as crap jackas kissas stupid  and a line said keep your feet of the grass wash your hands wipe your face and another line that people keep reporting but I am 11 and I still dont understand so    Its fine  For violence there is a fire breathing dragon knights fighting and more fighting not graphic its pretty funny and I wouldnt worry too much,5
244629,403번,Shrek,7,Shrek is a sweetfunny film for all of the family  Donkey is very funny and has some good jokes and all the characters have strong personalities  This film has themes of inner beauty and acceptance  Overall it is a lot fun and I would recommend it for kids,4
244630,403번,Shrek,7,MOVIE INFO,1
244631,403번,Shrek,7,Dont let your little one watch this movie unless you want you kids saying bad words that I dont care to repeat   But other then that its a really good movie,2
244943,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,This is my favorite movie of all time  There is just one number that you shouldnt show your young kids  Its called Make em Laugh  Cosmo Brown is just flipping off walls which might make your kid hurt themselves trying to do it  Other than that its a great movie that you should watch,5
244944,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,I enjoyed the movie Singin In The Rain it was a comical movie  My favorite character was Cosmo he had a lot of funny moments  I think that kids will love to watch this movie because of how funny it is  My one favorite song was Make Em Laugh by Cosmo,4
244945,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,I think that this is a good classic movie  Considering that it is a musical with catchy musicI didnt think that there was too much singing in it  The story wasnt to complex but I still enjoyed watching the movie,3
244946,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,A definite classic There is a lot of kissing and a whole lot of singing  Many parts show behind the scenes of making a movie in the silent era  When they are approached with movies with audio they need to get in position  It shows what is needed for a show to go on with some what I would call unnecessary singing,5
244947,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,This movie is great  For a G rating it does have some smoking kissing and some comical violence in the Make Em Laugh scene but not any other bad stuff,3
244948,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,A classic for the Whole Family that is just great,1
244949,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,Singin in the Rain is a wonderful classic musical for the whole family  There are several kisses and champagne and cigars are shown  Also there are some suggestive outfits for only a few shots though  The worst the language gets is dumb and dope  An aweinspiring soundtrack and a whimsical storyline make this musical about American stardom in the 1920s a fantastic film everyone is sure to love,5
244950,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,Singin in the Rain has countless times been named the greatest musical ever made and of course there are many reasons for this all of its songs are memorable it features the most iconic songanddance routine in film history and it celebrates talent creativity and imagination  Some of the comic elements in the film may be too sophisticated for children under 10 but the music is universal and the main focus of the film anyway  A loving tribute to Hollywood and its fickleness there are some selfcentred manipulative characters and passionate romantic moments to stay aware of,3
244951,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,Love it love it love it love it love it  Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooove IT,2
244952,415번,Singin' in the Rain,8,CSM doesnt always include everything  Did nobody notice that Olgas dressed inappropriatelyShes only shown in two scenes  Also this girl on a poster isnt dressed appropriately  Thats only one 10 second scene  I love Lina Also Don and Kathy kiss 2 times but thats all  Also Lina says 2 insults dope and dumb,8
245161,426번,Smallfoot,7,I think this movie is the best for 5 year olds its not as bad as u think it is,1
245162,426번,Smallfoot,7,Small Foot is just a masterpiece  Its really adorable as well definetly would recommend if your into fictional creatures,3
245163,426번,Smallfoot,7,I thought the music was great and the movie was really cute   I would watch it 3 more times,2
245164,426번,Smallfoot,7,This was a fun family movie The musical numbers were great and it had a very solid storyline  I found it very entertaining and fun,3
245165,426번,Smallfoot,7,It is very funny and interesting and also sad  It is fineso the parents can watch it with there kids,1
245166,426번,Smallfoot,7,I will admit it was better than I expected  Really good for a kids movie funny and cute although a little predictable and silly  Music was soso  In no way did it come off antireligious to me a religious teen  Totally worth the watch for a fun family movie night,5
245167,426번,Smallfoot,7,My 160000000 year old cranked that Zendata managing the data in movies to be less effective  Excuse me I think gothic teens will might be bored P Okay I will capture the Bigfoot in the 1970s instead ZendayaRants,4
245168,426번,Smallfoot,7,An unbelievably great movie a list of laughs a mile long,1
245169,426번,Smallfoot,7,Smallfoot is a good movie that you can watch with friends or family no violence or scary scenes there is about two or three sad parts in it and one part with tranquilizers but aside from that the movie is fun and it will not give any children nightmares the next night hopefully so do not be worried if they say they will be scared if they watch it,1
245336,441번,Song of the Sea,8,Song of the Sea is a beautifully told story  although the film is based around a little boy who is cruel to his sister and some parts include strange creatures that might make younger kids scared it is a great family movie  the animation is incredible and will be very inspiring to young artists,3
245337,441번,Song of the Sea,8,This is a movie that is worth rewatching again and again  I say that it is for ages six and up because anyone younger would not appreciate it but it is appropriate for all ages,2
245338,441번,Song of the Sea,8,I loved this movie  The graphics and story were beautiful  I strongly recommend watching it,3
245339,441번,Song of the Sea,8,its so cute and extremely good just a little creepy though,1
245340,441번,Song of the Sea,8,Violance some mild peril  In the beginning the audience is left to believe that a woman died  A boy gets almost hit by a car but the act is possibly played for laughs  An antagonists animals tries to take a child but is protected by other characters and the characters turns to stone by the animals but the child is safe and leaves  Sexy stuff a wife kisses her husband brief  Profanity Ben makes several religious exclaminations like holy molly and Jesus Maria and Josef feic off is written on a door but i didnt know what it meant and other children would probably not focus on that  Drinkingdrugssmoking Conor drinks at a pub in one scene brief which seems to be a habit for him since grandma said something like where were you drinking at the pub no other reference of pub drinking is made  Personally i think younger kids can watch it for the beautiful animation and soundtrack but the story might go over younger kids heads  But the csms age rating is still understandable  a girl goes down to the sea at night alone and swims in one scene Ben and maybe even Saorises goal is to go from the city back to the lighthouse without supervision for the major part of the movie a characters body slowly changesages the characters hair turns white and the body gets weaker  Overall a lovely movie that i recommend,14
245341,441번,Song of the Sea,8,Okay not to be rude or anything but the Song Of The Sea is a odd movie  The Song Of The Sea is about An Irish youth discovers that his mute sister is a selkie  A half human half seal   Who must find her voice and free supernatural creatures from the spell of a Celtic goddess  So the whole movie is hand drawn which makes all of them look creepy  Then the music is sooo weird  And not to mention the mom abandoned her family to go with the selkie pod It was confusing depressing and just plain weird  I think it might be super popular in Ireland  I just didnt think it was all that good,9
245342,441번,Song of the Sea,8,scary great role  models but its good and you might  need to go past some parts,1
245343,441번,Song of the Sea,8,I think that this movie is very good but is a little sad  I would definitely watch this again  The drawings and sound are incredible  Very good,4
245344,441번,Song of the Sea,8,This movie is really great  It is very complex and I had a hard time understanding the story but the imagery in this movie is unbelievable  I would not recommend this for younger children as the story is very complex and the plot deals with a heavy subject,3
245345,441번,Song of the Sea,8,I liked the Song of the Sea  It was grate and a litel scarey but other than that it was good,2
245479,443번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,In the movie it says hell and almost said son of a b,1
245480,443번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,Its a good movie i dont have anything else to say,1
245481,443번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,This movie has a lot of stuff,1
245482,443번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,The movie was exciting and if you liked sonic or not you would like it a lot it had good mix of scenes and makes the viewer intrigued on the movie and I think it would be for kids 9 but it does have a bit of violence so if you dont like violence you might not like it as much and overall it was a good movie,1
245483,443번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,Plot Sonic is alone on planet earth after fleeing from a tribe that tried to capture him as a child  When the government discovers Sonic they hire Dr  Robotnik Jim Carrey to track him down  Sonic acquires the help of his friend Tom James Marsden to help him get back to his home planet,3
245484,443번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,I liked it  Some unfinished cursing  Quite good,3
245485,443번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,fantastic it had a lot of good things and it was a little good and a little good but if you take one good away it is terrible  Scientificly people think that this movie is good the end,2
245486,443번,Sonic the Hedgehog,8,Parents need to know that this film is really good  James Marsden plays a character very similar to his in Hop which could confuse younger viewers  There is a lot of perilaction  In one scene someone drinks  There is lots of positive messages and role models  Some cutoff swearing like son of a  and what the   Lots of consumerism  The whole movie is an avritisement for the video game,8
245941,453번,Spaceballs,6,I found the humor rather boring and bad a lot of random swearing and such  Wouldnt recommend at all but defiantly not for kids under 13,2
245942,453번,Spaceballs,6,There is lots of swear words as well as groin related jokes however if your kids are mature enough to no whats not appropriate and what is as well as if your okay maybe covering your kids eyes in a couple of seams  But other then that its a great movie that well leave you laughing,2
245943,453번,Spaceballs,6,Spaceballs is a 1987 comedy movie directed by Mel Brooks and starring Rick Moranis Bill Pullman Mel Brooks John Candy and Daphne Zuniga,1
245944,453번,Spaceballs,6,This is a decent comedy spoof  It is funny and interesting to see how the original Star Wars characters are portrayed in this parody  The movie has some mild innuendo and a good amount of language including fck once sht and asshole  Its laughoutloud hilarious but its only a 3 star movie,4
245945,453번,Spaceballs,6,this is the best mel brooks move  is is much funny,2
245946,453번,Spaceballs,6,This is a good movie but more for the older audience,1
245947,453번,Spaceballs,6,This spoof on classic sciencefiction movies can be very dumb and wacky but thats what makes it so unique  The humor used throughout has very wacky concepts to it but yet these concepts are very innovative when used and are able to effectively satirize Star Wars Alien and more with successful results,2
245948,453번,Spaceballs,6,Spaceballs is a great Mel Brooks comedy with a laugh in a minute guarantee by all of the comedy lovers,1
245949,453번,Spaceballs,6,Spaceballs is actually the first spoof movie I ever saw and it was very funny and in a creative way  Sure some of the humor is predictable but all of the humor is very creative  Mel Brooks has created humor that NO ONE has ever thought of doing  Like when Dark Helmet accidentally hits a cameraman with his Schwartz it is very creative and hilarious  Mel Brooks Rick Moranis John Candy and Bill Pullman were perfect for their roles and gave me something to laugh at several times throughout the movie  However it gets pretty dirty halfway through,6
246099,460번,Spider-Man 2,8,Before no way home I have decided watching all of the spider man movies  AS I SAJD BEFOFE I BARELY remember this series so I went in this expecting a great experience and it was good,2
246100,460번,Spider-Man 2,8,has stilzied actionviolence,1
246101,460번,Spider-Man 2,8,CinematographyVisuals 45,1
246102,460번,Spider-Man 2,8,Its a fine movie and has a good villain  Its not as violent as the first movie,2
246103,460번,Spider-Man 2,8,I watched SpiderMan 2 back when I was probably 4 or 5  I remember the losing powers scene and just how good of a movie it was  But going back to the movie 8 years later just shows how harsh it actually is  Let me give you a brief idea of what I think is harsh in this movie  Let me know what you think,5
246104,460번,Spider-Man 2,8,I love this movie but it is violent and has long kissing scenes,1
246105,460번,Spider-Man 2,8,How is this ok for kids The wife sees a pane of glass hurtling towards her the entire emergency room staff are gutted  We stopped watching when the grandmother was dropped offa building  Not ok for kids,4
246106,460번,Spider-Man 2,8,Wow spider man 2 is the best spider man movie ever it was amazing I watched this movie when I was 7 and I loved it doc ock is a great villain the actors are amazing cgi was great for the time cgi still holds up kinda and I totally recommend this movie but if this is your kids 1st pg13 movie then I would go for spider man homecoming then this movie,1
246107,460번,Spider-Man 2,8,The only scene that you have to worry about is the medic scene its not scary its very violent for young kids and the concept of it is scary,1
246108,460번,Spider-Man 2,8,Not for younger kids but for older kid teens and tweens perfect  SpiderMan 2 is one of my favorite movies,2
246255,461번,Spider-Man 3,8,SpiderMan  3 may not not be the best of the series but it  is still really good and is a enjoyable  actionpacked blockbuster that you wont  wanna miss,1
246256,461번,Spider-Man 3,8,This movie has too much violence  It gave me nightmares  I had a nightmare of a character named Venom  I think this movie should be rated R for intense action violence,4
246257,461번,Spider-Man 3,8,The only reason why this movie gets so much hate is because the critics werent having it  It truly is spectacular how movie critics can sway the popular opinion surrounding a movie as great as SpiderMan 3  After overcoming various obstacles in the previous two movies Peter Parker SpiderMan is in the prime of his life  Hes with the girl of his dreams the city of New York loves him and hes just been given the key to the city  Peter eventually lets his pride get to him and he becomes oblivious to the troubles that those closest to him are facing  This lack of selfawareness leads to the untimely breakup between him and MJ and makes him susceptible to the symbiote suit which latches on to him halfway through the movie  This event gives rise to the black suited SpiderMan and consequently a cockier and even more oblivious emostyled Peter Parker  In exchange for enhanced powers and confidence Peter gives his humanity and kindness which made him who he was in the previous two movies  His newfound ferocious nature leads him to ferociously beatdown on Sandman and after believing that he has killed him Peter returns to his apartment   After a dispute with his beloved landlord Mr  Ditkovich Peter realizes that the black suit is bad for him and promptly puts it away  Mr  Ditkovich then helps Peter out by giving him some advice on how to flirt with MJ which includes the famous lines You are good woman I am good man  From then on the movie becomes all the more actionpacked leading to a thrilling climax at the end where Peter teams up with Harry to fight both Sandman and Venom  Would recommend to all buy this movie and show it to your kids,13
246258,461번,Spider-Man 3,8,SpiderMan 3 is a good movie  Its still a competent addition to the Raimi Trilogy but its undoubtedly the worst in it  I used to really like this movie but upon rewatching it my opinion changed  I still had fun with it but there was a lot of bad parts in the movie probably more so than good parts  The characters seem pretty different from the first two and the story is so rushed that its hard to get invested in this film,5
246259,461번,Spider-Man 3,8,This was personally my favorite of the three spiderman movies its theme was a little more mature than the other two spiderman aka peter parker almost goes evil in one section of the movie and it might be upsetting for kids when harry tries to kill peter in the end  But peter fights the temptation of becoming evil,2
246260,461번,Spider-Man 3,8,Okay great movie  It has three villains Hobgoblin Venom and Sandman  I dont know what they were thinking with including Hobgoblin and Venom  They let Hobgoblin get a good play in the end but Venom No  It was nice to have Venom as a sidevillain but they did a great job with Sandman,6
246261,461번,Spider-Man 3,8,Probably the best of the three this movie is quite a bit more intense than the first two if your kid was a little scared of the first two wait until heshe is 8,1
246262,461번,Spider-Man 3,8,Parents need to know that this is the third film in the SpiderMan franchise  It has lots of violence  Peter has some scary nightmares  Peter is really mean in some scenes and strikes someone he loves  SPOILER ALERT Many important characters die including one character who is a minor villain but a main character as well as a main character from the other two films That one is really sad  Lots of I am going to mary someone else or I will date your girlfriend kind of thing  Good Movie  The evil goo might scare younger viewers,8
246263,461번,Spider-Man 3,8,there is so much stabbing not so much cursing though if a kid under 8 watched it they would get nightmares,1
246676,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,Pros Plot was nice there was a lot of humor and it teaches nice lessons like unity and friendship  Also good animation,2
246677,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,More for younger kids,1
246678,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,Im a very simple girl  I instantly love almost everything at watchread  But this This has gotta be the first piece of media excluding music  that has weirded me out  And even then I rate it 3 stars  Anyways as for anything parents should be concerned about,6
246679,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH His hand shrinks,2
246680,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,When I watched this I expected something funny or sad or something but I got garbage  It has enough potty humor and nude scenes to make a five year old laugh for days  There were no surprises or anything that would shock the viewer so dont waste your time with it,3
246681,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,Theres nothing really inappropriate in spies in disguise  There is a scene with a naked man but you cant see anything to bad  you do see his butt very clearly but besides that theres no bad nudity  There is a normal amount of violence for a animated kids actioncomedy movie   As usual theres gross jokes and humor that will entertain a 58  That pretty much raps up my review the sad thing is that they had so much potential with this movie and they did nothing with it such talented voice actors to really a shame,6
246682,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,Super good it funny and surprising you should watch this your kids will love it,1
246683,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,Fun movie with nice story   Some parents comments are exagerated  This is a nice fun movie to watch,3
246693,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,Spies in Disguise is a great movie  It is a funny movie and a little sad  It is a great adventure story Wilbur is a great role model,4
246694,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,not funny but super funny haha i loved it,1
246695,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,I have seen on here that some parents are leaving reviews of 18 Like really This is such an awesome movie How is it disgusting It has a picked on nerdy kid who saves the day And plus it is unlikely friends that do it together It is a kids movie and the naked parts arent even that bad for you to be covering your kids eyes And those who are saying the boy said Fifty Shades of Yeah how is that bad if I may ask It is not like he is saying Fifty Shades of Grey  There are some dramatic people out there that dont deserve to write reviews on here  It is just made to be funny especially for kids If you say you wasted your money maybe you should have read the reviews and then maybe considered instead of just watching the movie and leaving a horrible an overexaggerated review Very disappointed in some of these reviews ugh,14
246696,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,I love this film I think it should be a TV show,2
246697,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,It was meh Tom Holland is always great but there were moments that were a bit cringe  They had some millennial memes under disguise there was a scene of nudity that was uncomfortable oh god dont get me started on the sumo thing  It just made me and the very very Christian homeschool girl Im friends with super uncomfortable,3
246698,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,Spies in disguise is a great movie in almost every way  Will Smith and Tom Holland knock it out of the park with voice acting it has detailed animation it is hilarious and it might just be one of my favorite movies  Expect some more mature themes though  Lots of violence and people dying not on screen but implied many moments where characters almost swear and there is some drinking  This movie is a must watch please watch it,5
246699,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,I think this movie is very very funny but there is a scary when the guy shows his robot self,1
246700,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,Great movie with lots of jokes  Love the cast not a lot of bad stuff,2
246701,463번,Spies in Disguise,6,best family film ever,1
246702,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,This movie    supercalafragilisticexpialodocious I loved this movie I thought it was just stunning The animation the storyline    But there is violence like kicking punching spy stuff  Mild language such as hell heck and the fword but it is beeped out,7
246703,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,This movie is very   funny,1
246704,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,Great movie with Will Smith and Tom Holland,2
246705,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,This is so awesome,1
246706,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,Scene where some male figure shows nudity  almost to the point of revealing the male gentalia      I was disgusted and couldnt believe the detail in art work that was sexually explicit   The f was bleeped and totally unnecessary  why pretend to use a cuss word as a bleep  it was annoying   just filth in my opinion   The majority of the humor is towards a younger age audience but the scenes I mentioned just took away from the humor and makes this a movie not a great pick for kids    I told my mom not to let my younger siblings watch it,5
246707,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,Although Spies in Disguise is a very comedic movie with great voice actors it has lots of violent scenes that make you say Ouch or Oooo out loud while watching the movie  My parents really enjoyed Spies in Disguise so I guess there are mixed feeling about it but every movie has different people watching it w opinions right If you are looking for a very funny kids spy movie and you dont care about watching some characters battle it out then this movie should be your top pick,5
246708,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,it is hilarious but when there in kamoras apartmant they say hands up and see kamoras butt little kids find it funny though,1
246709,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,I am 14 years old and I watched it with my family and enjoyed it nd laughed  This Animation is suitable for all ages and i totally recommend,2
246710,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,Its very good  its really funny  It has potty humor and has some peril but overall has great messages and roll models,3
246711,463번,Spies in Disguise,8,Parents need to know that this movie is very good,1
246815,465번,Spirited Away,7,i love all the Japanese films from studio ghilbi and this was one of my favorites  the beautiful animation and characters are a masterpiece and the story is amazing  though the movie is beautifully done some scenes are bloody and violent,3
246816,465번,Spirited Away,7,This is a really good movie Its about a girl whos parents are turned into pigs  She tries to find them but there a lot of other things that she has to do  This movie can be creepy but not too creepy  However there are a few scary parts so if you have a child who gets scared easilythis movie might not be great for them,5
246817,465번,Spirited Away,7,i think its a wonderfull movie but maybe a little of a lot of violence,1
246818,465번,Spirited Away,7,Beautiful movie cool story but can be scary when a dragon gets hurt and is bleeding all over the place,1
246819,465번,Spirited Away,7,This is my absolute favorite movie of all time However I would NOT recommend this for children under the age of 10 or children that get creeped out easily  There are several extremely disturbing characters such as No Face a spirit that goes crazy and eats people  His appearance may also be frightening to some viewers  The parents turn into giant pigs at the beginning which could also frighten children  However the 10yearold main character is very brave and goes through lots of solid character development throughout the movie she goes from being bratty and lazy to being brave and kind and the one of the themes that I personally took from the movie was kindness,6
246820,465번,Spirited Away,7,It may be a little bit creepy for younger children but i LOVE IT  There is a few parts like a frog smoking the babys butt is not covered  a boy in dragon form getting attacked by paper birds and bleeding and throwing up blood and almost bleeding to death and a creature named Noface luring people with gold and eating them  I have no idea how 7 year olds could be scared by this  Just make sure that your child is mature enough to not be scared by ghosts and things  Just know that this is 5 stars,5
246821,465번,Spirited Away,7,Yes Princess Mononoke is good Howls moving castle is good  But they do not come close to this film  Spirited away is a great movie  I think ages 10 will really enjoy it   There is nothing bad in it although when No face becomes crazy and starts to eat people that might scare some younger kids but it is not too bad,5
246822,465번,Spirited Away,7,Spirited Away is a beautiful movie one that makes you immediately want to watch it again  The soundtrack is lovely  the characters are all memorable and likable even the bad guys and visually the movie is stunning,2
246823,465번,Spirited Away,7,I am 7 years old and I have watched spirited away  For me it is  6 and up  But I can see how other people may not  like it and be scared of it  SUPER AWSOME AND EXCITING,4
247067,469번,Spy Kids,7,Just the right combination of fantasy and comedy,1
247068,469번,Spy Kids,7,VIOLENCE SCARINESS AND GORE  People are turned into mutant creatures for a kids TV show in the movie  The show also has a lot of fingers designed to look like humans  Might creep kids out  No blood,4
247069,469번,Spy Kids,7,Exciting familyfriendly tale with some violence peril,1
247070,469번,Spy Kids,7,Pretty solid film but there is one scene where the mom of the kids whispers into the dads ear to persuade him  This is a bit sexual,2
247071,469번,Spy Kids,7,This movie is very boring and bad  The sister character is annoying and unlikable  This is one of the most overrated and boring movies Ive ever seen,3
247072,469번,Spy Kids,7,AMAZING film but bewarned of one almost 4 letter word,1
247073,469번,Spy Kids,7,Spy Kids was my favorite movie as a kid and I still love it today  I used to watch it all the time when I was younger  This movie has a lot of great role models  Yes its a little stupid but overall it was very ahead of its time  It has good representation strong female leads Hispanic family a good plot and its enjoyable to watch  I strongly recommend this movie for all ages  Some younger kids could be startled by the fooglies and they could not understand the plot,7
247074,469번,Spy Kids,7,GREAT  Six year olds can really enjoy this amazing film  Even the grown up spies are GREAT  Yeah suitable for six and over,4
247329,473번,Stand by Me,7,THIS WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS  Stand by me is a sweet movie about four 12 year olds go on a quest to search for a dead body  A ton of strong language is used  It is one of my favorite movies  My favorite kid is teddy  I would rather let kids watch this then disney crap  While the boys search another group and up beating the boys to the body   Gordy pulls out a gun  None of the groups take this body  Later the body if found and neither of the groups is given credit  Amazing movie with awesome ,11
247330,473번,Stand by Me,7,This movie follows four best friends going on possibly their last adventure together  There is quite a lot of cussing  But as Wil Wheaton said Parents who think their kids dont cuss are just fooling themselves  This movie is amazing and perfect for growing teens  I would recommend to anyone who cares to see it,5
247331,473번,Stand by Me,7,This is an example of a rating completely baffling me  If this didnt have the F bombs and smoking it would be PG  I actually encourage you to show any kid 6 and up this movie its rated so unfairly  Realistic language that 12 year old boys actually speak I should know  A few kids smoke cigarettes but if your kid has seen someone smoke in real life its no different  Wheres your kid going to get cigarettes anyway A few kids talk about tits again like we actually do in real life  At the end a dead body is seen not too graphic a little blood  The movie has great messages behind it like friendship and loyalty and even just doing the right thing  The main character is a great role model except for the smoking,10
247332,473번,Stand by Me,7,people die and kids do drugs but still one of the best,1
247333,473번,Stand by Me,7,This is a fantastic movie  Ive seen this countless times since I was around 8  I have two younger siblings whom have grown up watching it  While there is plenty of swearing some smoking and it really evolves around a search for a murdered body I really think that the overall message of friendship and loyalty hence the name Stand By Me over powers it all  And yes there are sexual innuendos like most shows and movies these days  They will fly over the younger audiences heads  I really think that if your child has been exposed to any media violence and rough language this movie is fine for them to watch,7
247334,473번,Stand by Me,7,Great movie  I watched it when I was 10 first R rated movie  It has strong lenguge 11f words 110 uses of py 1 use ck possibly 1 use of ct  This also has four 12 year old boys talk about sexual stuff boobsetc eight 18 year old boys talk about getting laid  12 year olds carry around around a 45 caliber  Very intense but still if your kid has played gta4or5 they will love this movie,5
247335,473번,Stand by Me,7,The movie is funny clever depressing adventurous and chilling all at the same time  Dont let the R rating put you away from the film  There is some strong language but there are lots of positive messages of growing up strong with others  A great classic,4
247336,473번,Stand by Me,7,stand by me is a great moviebut has a lot of language and smoking,1
247337,473번,Stand by Me,7,I think this is completely okay for early teens   As far as the language goes thats what 12 and 13 yr olds actually talk like   There are some references to  child abuse both physical and emotional but its not bad at all   Stand By Me is the perfect movie for teens,4
247338,473번,Stand by Me,7,Its a great movie about 4 boys who act older as their adventure goes on Interesting movie about how kids grow up and become teenagers,1
247410,476번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,I didnt think this series could get any better but it does This movie kind of shows up the previous one but the first one sets up nicely for this one,2
247411,476번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,Star Trek Into Darkness is a 2013 scifi movie directed by J  J  Abrams and starring Chris Pine Zachary Quinto Benedict Cumberbatch Alice Eve Simon Pegg and Leonard Nimoy,1
247412,476번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,JJ Abrams is a good director  His best attributes have to be his attention to detail intricacies in characters and intense suspense,2
247413,476번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,Overall this movie is very good  At the discretion of parents I would not allow a kid to watch this movie until they are AT LEAST 14,2
247414,476번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,This film has a lot of violence and is very intense  There is strong punching kick shooting stabbing and more  On one bit a guy crushes a mans head and stamps on a whoman lying on the floor  She then has to go to hospital meaning it was A bad injury  On one fight scene there is very strong violence and a man gets his neck snapped  They are also being continuously punched and being slammed against walls  It is very stressful and intense  There is bad language used very often including bloody bastard bitch shit ass crap damn and more  The language is not as bad as the first one because that one has an F bomb at the beginning  Going back to the violence there is some blood  Whomen are shown in bed topless with men and there is lots of underwear  For mature 10 year olds or 11 year olds  There is great messages and role model as the captain dies to save his crew  Spoiler alert   he comes back to life  Also enemies become friends in the film  There is also drinking at a bar,16
247415,476번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,Omagersh this movie was absolutely terrible The plot was really only for a gasp for the audience  They were more concerned with the gasp than the Wow  That was really interesting Its certainly making me think,5
247416,476번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,Amazing movie  I think the storyline is amazing and the acting is superb  J J Abrams did an amazing job on this film if it even is a little bit violent I think little kids may not like this movie as it is a bit scary for their age group Their is a few st  and a word very close to the Fword  This 2 and a half hour movie is great and definitely worth your time,4
247417,476번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,This was a an excellent second movie It was not disappointing at all There were some creepy parts but they really werent too bad Overall it is a fantastic movie to watch  ,5
247418,476번,Star Trek Into Darkness,8,My rating hard PG13 for graphic nudity racy content language and some bloody violence,1
247661,490번,Steve Jobs,8,great,1
247662,490번,Steve Jobs,8,I am a Apple Fan and I honestly love this movie  It tells about how we got the device that we know and love today  However try watching it together if you have a 67 year old as it does contain some language,3
247663,490번,Steve Jobs,8,Why is everyone making a huge deal about the appropriateness of this movie Its literally just swearing  And Ive heard WAY more swearing in other movies  By age 8 Id heard all these words before  Its not like kids will watch this movie and suddenly start cussing At one point Jobs asks his assistant Why havent we slept together which is the only reference to sex in the entire movie,7
247664,490번,Steve Jobs,8,I think the format of this movie is really interesting  When I started to watch it I thought it was going to be like every other biopic but I actually found it very engaging I also think the casting is great especially Michael Fassbender,3
247665,490번,Steve Jobs,8,There is no other film with such perfect timing and dialogue  An overwhelming sense of emotion is tirelessly infused within the script  The acting portrays not just the characters but human stories that all can relate with  The music is a collision much like Jobs of creativity yet also pause  This film is a miracle,5
247666,490번,Steve Jobs,8,A TON OF UNNECESSARY CUSSING Buuuuuut if your kid can handle it its ok  I watched it because my dad worshiped him lol  It was a good educational movie,4
247667,490번,Steve Jobs,8,Michael Fassbenders portrayal and Danny Boyles direction really shine here as both of them show brilliant roles in their part   Aron Sorkins dialogue also is amazing  Also the cinematography is brilliant and was amazing to see that in the first act a 16 mil lens was used than a 18 mil lens in the second act ans then was shot on digital cameras to show the progression of technology,3
247668,490번,Steve Jobs,8,This was a really interesting movie because it  didnt have any plot at all  it was basically just Steve Jobs launching three different products with no flashbacks showing you his past life or careers at all  Whether youre intrigued or utterly confused at that type of filmmaking is a matter of personal opinion  However what is NOT a matter of personal opinion is the frequent usage of strong language such as fk st ahole and the like  Also something that CSM didnt cover which is part of the reason Im writing this review is that a Time magazine interview in which Steve Jobs joked that 28 of American men slept with his wife and therefore produced his daughter which later comes back at him is referenced a lot especially towards the beginning  Overall the film isnt that bad contentwise especially for an Rrated movie and is appropriate for teens to see if it holds their interest that is  My MPAA rating R for language,7
247669,490번,Steve Jobs,8,Though this is my favorite movie The Language has some dmns,1
248350,531번,Tarzan,6,Well honestly this seems a perfect movie for a five year old  For a G movie its violent for little ones because,2
248351,531번,Tarzan,6,I was really dissapointed  Women shouldnt be showing of their elbows all the time  Its disgusting  A woman should be modest  My 10 year old son couldnt stop ogling those elbows  It was awful,6
248352,531번,Tarzan,6,It is rated G and a great movie,1
248353,531번,Tarzan,6,This movie is kind of good  Kids will love this Disneycartoon movie  This movie is kind of funny and has humor  Though this movie is kind of intense  Shooting is involve  There is some brief cruleness  Mild sex is involve,7
248354,531번,Tarzan,6,Good example of a golden age Disney movie,1
248355,531번,Tarzan,6,I just want to say there is SO much death in this movie First Tarzans parents are unceremoniously eaten by a leopard within the first five minutes and you can see bloody pawprints surrounding them  Then a little baby gorilla is out with his family and he chases a butterfly away from his parents  Were all thinking Aww what a little cutie maybe this will be a sweet movie after all And then the leopard comes  The father gorilla knows they wont be able to save the baby so he holds the mother gorilla back  The poor little baby gorilla is eaten by the leopard offscreen but you can still hear the poor thing screaming in pain and the mother gorilla just hides her face against her husbandmate and cries  Then at the end of the movie the alpha gorilla is shot and killed leaving poor Tarzan heartbroken but in charge of the gorilla troop  And then in the worst Disney death EVER the hunter guy gah I cant remember his name    gets tangled in vines and tries to cut himself free  Little does he know there is a vine entwined around his neck and he basically hangs himself by mistake  You see him plummeting and screaming and then the screen pans to Tarzans shocked face  Then a convenient little flash of lightning illuminates the villains dead body  I know that villains should be punished but that seems a bit far dont you think ANYWAYS the reason I gave three stars instead of one is that the plotline of Tarzan learning how to be human is really sweet and funny  Also I love the music especially Trashing the Camp EARWORM ALERT So if your kids can handle the gore and death I think this is a pretty good movie  Still I wish that not as many characters died  That kind of ruined it for me as I am very sensitive about that kind of thing   Im not saying I hate this movie  In fact I think its pretty good  I just get kind of upset whenever anyone dies  P S Watch Trashin the camp  Look at that teapot  ITS MRS  POTTS I freaked when I saw that  LOL,26
248356,531번,Tarzan,6,This movie is very frightening but older kids 10 to 12 year olds will love it  In one scene Tarzan cuts open a leopard and Kerchacks death is very sad  There are some good messages like that characters can fit in even when they are from different places   Though most of the good messages are blocked out by guns there are still a few more like that you may get injured when saving your friends but it is worth it   Clayton is very scary   His actions involve killing a few gorillas   His death is very violent   Overall it is a good movie for tweens,8
248429,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,I saw the premiere at the beach then my sister watched over and over again it was a movie about Mack Maia Mitchell and Brady Ross Lynch I thought fallin for you was pretty catchy but I hated the rest of the movie I couldnt get past 30 minutes dont bother with this movie watch High School Musical if you like musicals and Disney channel,1
248430,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,I personally thought this movie was cute fun and enjoyable I really dont see how it can be considered inappropriate in any way there isnt even any kissing  The romance between Brady and Mac is so subtle that I didnt even realize that they were more than friends until they mentioned a possible breakup  And for the people complaining about the revealing swimwear they are at the beach What do you want them to wear full bodysuits The bathing suits are 60s fashion so I honestly think they are a lot more modest looking than current ones are and you can see nude colored material at certain points that the actresses are wearing under their costumes so nothing is revealed  For the love of god your child isnt going to become a sexcrazed demon because they saw a girls stomach  As for the plot itself there are definitely plot holes but none that really take away from the film  The whole mad scientist bit was just dumb and unnecessary and I think everyone else can agree with that as well  The cast was pretty good I dont really care that much for ross lynch I felt like I was watching the same exact character from Austin and Ally  Everyone else was great though There are tons of positive messages cliche ones like follow your dream and ones I was pleasantly surprised by there is more to life than trying to attract boys  The musical numbers were fun and catchy overplayed a bit in commercials but that shouldnt be a surprise  Overall I really think this movie is safe for young ones and fun for older kids too my brother is 10 and loves it,14
248431,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,This movie never appealed to me at all especially being an eleven yr  Old  The charachter cast and meager confusing storyline makes for a performance that is far below disneys usual standards,2
248432,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,This movie was HORRIBLE  It was corny and had no real humor  Love was basically directing this whole film if you know what I mean  But the cheesy kind of love  Just kissing and all that  It was just so bad,6
248433,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,It has a positive idea but is probably too childish for anyone over ten,1
248434,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,People keep saying that the movie is very inappropriatethey dont curse once there is no product placement and there is a great message  I mean sure there are bikinis and guys with their shirts off but do you want to take your family to the beach Well thats what youre gonna see  Kids arent gonna say I wanna be like Brady and take their shirts off  If you think kids are like sponges know that sponges dont take their shirts off,5
248435,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,This movie is terrible it has a bad soundtrack and a horrible story plot  so I go down in a wave and come back up in a 1950s movie seems pretty fun to me  NOT I would rather watch Baby Einstein for the rest of my life then Watch this movie again even though I only saw 30 minutes of it,4
248436,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,this is a dumb movie firstthis movie is so not about 60s n everything seems like now a lot of girl dress inapropriettall bootsshortsbikinis this movie is trying to make 60s look really modern and similar to todaybut its not like that watch west side story that movie talks about racisam n another social problems in the 60s and 70s i think kids need to know the truth about the 60s and disney always makes thing look betterherculessleeping beauty and another lies,1
248437,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,No matter what its about awesome movie ,2
248438,534번,Teen Beach Movie,8,This is a great movie for kids all the way up to teens   I watched this movie with my mom and she LOVED it   It is a movie I would definitely recommend for all ages,3
248780,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,The whirlwind animated adventure is a visual treat for tweens,1
248781,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,The Adventures of  Tintin has lots of adventure you guessed it and violence with pirates fighting some blood and lots of guns  Also the story is nice and ambiguous  Some may love this however what brings the movie rating down for me is that some scenes were too unreal and their was too much drinking  Once a pirate captain got directly hit by lightning but he was completely fine afterwards  Also the main character had been chased by pirates with guns at least ten times but did not get hit The worst part was probably where the drinking So much and even the dog got drunk This is way to unrealistic  Did I mention the dog is as smart as a human and seems to understand english,9
248782,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,Unless you are prepared to deal with nightmares or acts of pretend violence this movie is for you,1
248783,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,This movie is really fun I like it Its just a nice adventure movie to watch if you dont want to watch something emotional  TINTIN MY BELOVED   Great movie,5
248784,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,It is a good movie but they could have done it a little more entertaining,1
248785,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,this movie is great but there are tons of guns haddock is obsessed with alcohol and the blood on the newspaper seems really realistic for CGI,1
248786,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,I remember watching this for the first time back 2011 and being absolutely blown away by the visuals  The writing was a lot more mature but fun,2
248787,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,This is actually my favorite moviethough I am bit biased due to the fact that it was my childhood movie My parents didnt know that it was a more mature movie and brought me a long when I was 3   the action and violence flew over my head and I didnt really know what was happening  Though I was not scared by it I dont recommend that age After I grew older and learned to appreciate this movie I came to love it   I found the books and it made the movie even more of a treat  Tintin is a great role model and is the best Captain Haddocks drinking problem can not be ignored though  If you show it to kids you might want to inform about that and tell them it is bad  And if there is a child in the room you might want to tell them to close their eyes when the man is shot with a machine gun  Other than that the violence is mild with a few punches and missed gun shots,10
248788,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,8,This is pretty much appropriate for all ages as long as you skip through the violent scenes,1
248866,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,I say the violence only tentatively  Men get shot stabbed yet blood is only seen once  Most people hold gunsfire weapons  Haddock goes quite crazy after drinking and he drinks a lot  Tintin is quite intelligent resourceful and tough  Thompson and Thompson are humorous in that they are slightly reminiscent of the three stooges  An interesting point is that only one woman is seen in the whole movie  She is only secondary however  Also a startling point is that no children are present whatsoever  Tintin may look young but that premonition is quickly blown away,10
248867,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,I saw this movie when it came out in 3D this movie kept my intrest in this movie but my mom was kind of bored in some parts  so take your kids to see this movie it like indiana jones met pirates of the caribbean,2
248868,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,Like my title the books were way better trust me I know I have them all even the ones not released in the US like Tintin in the Congo  The movie is still good and is a must see for any Tintin fan  The Rating is PG which is solid but it is leaning to PG13 there is a man who gets shot partway into the movie and it shows him falling to the ground with some blood  Drinking is also a main theme in the movie but the positive rollmodels and the messages in the movie more then make up for the bad things age wise  This is a movie almost any age could see if they didnt mind some violence and a little blood  The humor is great  All in all a great movie for anyone,7
248869,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,When Nickelodeon Productions popped out of no where with the hit movie Rango I was baffled  It had a great mystery plot and best of all excellent CGI graphics  I loved it,3
248870,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,Steven Spielbergs long awaited and hotly anticipated new holiday movie One of two the other being War Horse which I have yet to see myself The adventures of Tintin is for all of the rave reviews and huge foreign and worldwide box office success and the long year of hype and anticipation thrown at Spielbergs feet it is just absolutely heartbreaking for me to report that I was greatly disappointing  And to add I have been a lifelong fan of the original Herge comics so I am not exactly very new to the whole Tintin franchise in the first place Tintin is very nice looking in fact it quiet possibly and very easily has by far the best use of motioncapture animation and computer animation technology that I have ever seen in any movie thus far  But that is the only good thing bout it  Tintin is a lifeless extremely long and almost interminably dull movie that quit on the viewer long before it even gets to its depressing futile ending  It appears that the magic of Spielbergs movies have been absent from his films for some six or seven years now  Here just hoping that War Horse still has some of that left in it  But despite being Rated PG and being marketed heavily and almost completely towards children The Adventures of Tintin is certainly not for young kidsThere is infrequent but very intense and brutal for an animated movie cartoon violence with several rather harsh deaths and scenes which actually also have quiet of bit of animated blood  Also there is constant nonstop drinking and alcohol use and consumption in the form of the sidecharacter of Captain Haddock who is a great drunk  Finally there is extremely infrequent mild language with only one use of real profanity in the entire movie with that being in the form of dmn  So if you did like many people did happen to like it than great  I just wish it could have been much better than it unfortunately and depressingly was,11
248871,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,The adventures of Tintin is great movie to see with family friends or by yourself  The main character is a young reporter who unknowingly falls into an adventure that takes him around the world  Tintin is well meaning and wants to help most people but also fights when he has to  I dont think many people noticed but there arent that many female characters but that doesnt hold it back  It is violent at sometimes one character getting machine gunned to death but thats the most violence  One character is usually drunk and people dont like it but he overcomes his alcoholism,6
248872,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,Great animation  My rating Intense action crude humor drinking and a murder,2
248873,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,The movie was very violent lots of gun fights dark and confusing for children   My 8yearold daughter laughed out loud a few times but she didnt understand the story  the pace was fast the vocabulary was often over her head and the allusions obscure,2
248874,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,This movie is definitely familyfriendly but as a 13yearold I was seriously disappointed  It went on too long and there were only 2 laughoutloud moments in the entire movie  It didnt really capture my attention because the storyline was hard to follow  I eventually got it but it was just confusing  My personal opinion is that this movie was boring and would definitely be enjoyed more by younger kids,5
248875,560번,The Adventures of Tintin,6,We run a pretty conservative household and I took my 4year old daughter and 6year old son   Bear in mind we have almost no computer time yet for them and very little TV    so our bar for acceptable media is pretty high   I was a little concerned some of the content could be scary for my daughter so we discussed in advance    Both kids just loved the movie  it was not scary to either of them and the violence was completely antiseptic in my view and not inappropriate at all   Believe me theres nothing appealing about Capt  Haddocks drinking  its a lot more likely to push kids away from a drink than towards it   Simply wonderful movie,7
248905,564번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,The Amazing SpiderMan 2 may have a bit of mistakes but this was my absolute favorite I think what interested me was the SpiderMan costume because it looked exactly like the same suit in the comics  This movie has been AMAZING for me Andrew Garfield is awesome at SpiderMan and Emma Stone is great at acting as Gwen Stacy,4
248906,564번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,Some good messages Think with great power comes great responsibility But sadly consumerism  With AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 costumes to hats to MARVEL SELECT toys  Do not forget McDonalds was a thing in this production BTW Andrew was my fave but now i am SUCH THE FAN of Tom Holland and even got a morphsuit of Tom Hollands Spidey suit,3
248907,564번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,Not Really Violent Not really Sexual but lots of Consumerism  The Plot is very Clunky but overall Parents i guess its okay to let your kids watch this,2
248908,564번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,Great SpiderMan movie  Does have a lot of violence but with really good role models,2
248909,564번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,This movie isnt that good  It has 3 villains and a bunch of plot holes that are confusing  Overall just dont watch it  There are better spider man movies out there  As a huge spider man fan myself I feel a bit disappointed,5
248910,564번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,This is one of the worst movies Ive ever seen  Violence includes deaths of characters disease electric shots out of hands gun shots action destruction and bombs  SpiderMan is a really bad role model and is mean to others  This movie scarred history forever,4
248911,564번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,Andrew Garfield stars as SpiderMan in this sloppy forgettable SpiderMan movie  The plot is confusing Electro is a villain because he has no friends and Peter Parker is a jerk to multiple people  Expect lots and lots of violence and kissing in the movie that tarnished the name of SpiderMan,3
248912,564번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,This movie is GREAT But this is important   In terms of language I heard multiple use of goddamn and damn about 3 uses of ass  5 hell and 1 Holy st  Violence includes neck snapping explosions gunfire falling from heights and choking  Overall good movie but watch it with your kids,4
248913,564번,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,8,i dont know why critics are calling this the worst spiderman film this had a 52 on rotten tomatoes and guess what spiderman 3 had a 63 honestly critics these days  But listen to me instead this is actually really fun so skip spiderman 3 and watch this,3

249092,565번,The Amazing Spider-Man,8,Awesome film This film is really good and is fine for a kid to watch,2
249093,565번,The Amazing Spider-Man,8,Some violence shooting one stabbing  Movie is very entertaining and intense  Good storyline  Little kids will probably be scared  Overall very good movie 9,6
249094,565번,The Amazing Spider-Man,8,As for why they made a reboot I am not sure as Spiderman 3 was fantastic but as for the reboot there is lots of coming book violence but the new Peter Parker is a very positive role model for young kids,1
249095,565번,The Amazing Spider-Man,8,Its the same SpiderMan story with a different twist   Peters girlfriends father is a police chief and the villain is Peters mentor   I enjoyed it even more than the first Andrew Garfield is cute and dorky and his girlfriend Emma Stone plays your notsotypical blonde   Overall charming and a mustsee for Marvel nerds,4
249096,565번,The Amazing Spider-Man,8,not as amazing as it looks but really promising for spidey fans like me,1
249097,565번,The Amazing Spider-Man,8,A lot of action,1
249559,585번,The BFG,8,I love this movie I cant say anything bad about it other than the fact that it could be a bit scary for younger a kids,1
249560,585번,The BFG,8,Its okay overall there are some scenes of scares and mild violence,1
249561,585번,The BFG,8,Youre going to think I am crazy for saying 9 and 2 stars but I watched this when I was what 7 or 8 and I didnt like it  It was scary sometimes and boring all the other times  I made it through the whole movie finally when I was 8 or 9 but I wasnt paying attention because it was SO BORING  UGH,5
249562,585번,The BFG,8,I love the book for this movie just as much,1
249563,585번,The BFG,8,Of course I love anything Roald Dahl inspired  The BFG is funny lighthearted and has the beautiful message of believing in yourself even if you feel small  Beware small children may be scared on the bigger giants who steal children from their beds and eat them,3
249564,585번,The BFG,8,I love this movie especially when the Queens corgis go flying round and up the house,1
249565,585번,The BFG,8,i read this book at school when i was 10 and i saw the movie when i ws seven years old this is an amazing book to read to kids and it is very entertaining,1
249566,585번,The BFG,8,Boring and Confusing  This movie is so confusing only 11 would know whats going on  NOT A FAN,3
249567,585번,The BFG,8,my mom thought the giants were a little bit scary but from my point of view it was a non scary silly adventurous movie,1
249578,585번,The BFG,7,Its a great variation of the book  It has a bit of toilet humour but kids will love it A bit of scariness but not that much  I loved the slimy vegetables All in all it was pretty good,5
249579,585번,The BFG,7,A bit boring but some bits can be funny the giant is well made and it seems real the acting rolls are not to bad depending on the scene,1
249580,585번,The BFG,7,The movie is a great idea its perfect for children and even people who enjoy movies such as this its nothing like any other giant movie i hope youll like it as much as i did,1
249581,585번,The BFG,7,This movie is amazing They just dont make movies like this anymore where it can be entertaining without cursing or inappropriate content  Pros funny no cussing animation is breathtaking plus the storyline is interesting for all ages  Cons a whole scene is dedicated to fart jokes but it was pretty funny though violence that can scare small children but besides that its a great movie,4
249582,585번,The BFG,7,For me the movie was positively boring and not very exciting  For my mom and dad they thought it was great  It definitely was not what I expected based on the trailers however it has great heart and a positive message  Personally I would not recommend it especially for younger kids  I think younger kids would find it too thoughtprovoking and a bit too slow and lack of magic,5
249583,585번,The BFG,7,the BFG was a very good movie If you have toddlers or 6 and below kids I prefer not to watch with them But otherwise sureAt times it can be dark or scary At others they teach you lessons or it can be funny,1
249584,585번,The BFG,7,The BFG brings back to film industry to Steven Spielberg with a genuine work aimed at adults and infants that covets to has the same impact than the previous classics of the director nevertheless his film does not capture such pleasures,1
249585,585번,The BFG,7,This is a lovely movie for families  Some scenes might scare young children under 7  It was a bit boring but very good  Worth seeing it,5
250099,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,Epic sequel has tons of actionviolence,1
250100,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,This is a great sequel and has a great plot but it is violent  There is also some swearing such as one use of fcking and a few uses of st dan and as,2
250101,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,The Bourne Supremacy  yeah its not brilliant in my opinion but its still a good action sequel and better than Identity with more action scenes but hopefully Ultimatum will be even better  There are some violent brutal scenes although not much blood and an Fword so Id recommend this for ages 13 and up  Not bad  An improvement on the soso first film,4
250102,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,This movie is pretty good  Its the second Bourne movie and I enjoyed it a lot,2
250103,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,The Bourne Supremacy improves from the previous movie by doubling up the thrills action and fun to make an even better sequel  This movie does have tons and tons of violence but same as its first movie it is fine for older Tweens and up,2
250104,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,Language 4 510  Violence 810  Sexy Content 010,1
250105,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,This movie is brilliant  It is the second movie in the Bourne series  It is wellacted but pretty violent  Bourne is an easy model to root for although he beats up and kills potential assassins and injures innocent bystanders in a heartstopping car chase  One man shoots himself but we are spared the full gore  Another man gets stabbed by a fellow agent  Jason fights another man which ends up with strangulation  Jasons girlfriend is shot by an assassins bullet meant for him,8
250106,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,This is a pretty good movie with a hell lot of violence blood and killing  The language son of a b is normal,2
250107,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,The Bourne Supremacy is as outstanding as the first  With hard intense action which has my favorite scene in the film the fight is the house  It was gripping and realistic since there was no music in the background until it was over an excellent continuation of the story great acting from Damon and new additions Joan Allen Brian Cox and Karl Urban and John Powells score is great  Grade A,4
250108,602번,The Bourne Supremacy,8,My ratingR for strong violence some racy content alcohol use and language throughout,1
250527,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,I watched this with my 12 year old cousin and he was fine the blood and gore is over the top but it is by unrealistic monsters it is a great film if you can handle blood,1
250528,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,Okay first of all I wanted to see this movie really badly  So I saw it  I hate this movie  I dont like movies when literally the whole thing is gallons and gallons of blood is just spurting out everywhere every 5 seconds  This movie is so stupid dont even think about wasting money to see this  Its pointless with pretty much no plot,6
250529,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,Cabin in the Woods doesnt go for the easy horror movie laughs that the Scary Movie franchise tries to elicit but it is a curiously interesting satire on why horror movies can be so cliched and ridiculous at times  The movie itself isnt too scary save for a few jump scares but its wit keeps it afloat and distinguishes it among other lesser flicks,2
250530,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,Cabin In The Woods had a great concept but I felt overall the actual movie was very weak and bland  Now on to the parents guide  I watched this movie knowing that it would have gore and language but I didnt know how gory this movie would be  It was pretty bad the first part of the film but about the last thirty minutes of the film it is a total gore fest  There was one scene where in about two minutes in one room monsters escape and grisly kill the men in the room and blood shoots on the roof and on the wall and floor and people are ripped in half and dismembered and decapitated and eaten all in one room the violence made me shiver and one of my favorite movies are kill bill so strongly caution with 14  there  is also one scene of nudity and tons of drugs and language,5
250531,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,As the title said Cabin in the Woods is very dark  It can be very disturbing at points to  It was very well written though and it has a lot of humor  I enjoyed it a lot  It is a very good new take on the horror genre,5
250532,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,The Cabin in the Woods adds new ideas to the horror genre which is falling apart it is visually stunning not that scary but the violence language sex and drinking makes it not recommended for under 15 this age specifically because it is more funny than scary but it has a lot,1
250533,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,I really enjoyed this movie and thought it was clever  I didnt like the drug use and sexuality in the movie there wasnt too too much but there was enough and I think the movie would have been better without it  The main thing about this movie is it is very gory and not good for kids and if your sondaughter can handle lots of blood and scary monsters its fine  If not then do not let them watch this it is very VERY gory,4
250534,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,I am not at all a fan of horror movies but I loved this movie  Its hilarious interesting and refreshingly original  I was 16 when I saw this and had no problems with it but wouldnt recommend it to anyone much younger than that,3
250535,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,The Cabin in the Woods definitely has a witty screenplay and is a smart horror comedy  It features excellent direction and some decent acting  Very original and unique but pause for kids fifteen and under  The film has some sexual contentnudity heavy language some smoking and drug use from a certain character and a large amount of violence  A,5
250536,619번,The Cabin in the Woods,8,this movie scares me to death  i dont wanna watch itnot only that it is really scarybutit has innapropriate languageand i dont like itand theres drugs in it and i heard that drugs will make you really sicki hate this movie i wish movies like this were never invented,4
250616,627번,The Cat Returns,7,I like a lot of Studio Ghibli movies but OMG this is the best The animation is so cute and like everyone else I fell in love with Baron Humbert von Gikkingen  Hes so dashing and handsome  Its  a short but sweet film and one of my top recommendations,4
250617,627번,The Cat Returns,7,OMG best Ghibli film ever  I loved all the characters and everything was adorable  To be honest I fell in love with the baron  In my opinion best anime film ever,5
250618,627번,The Cat Returns,7,This film was was extremely easy to watch and follow with the storyline being typical of a normal movie  I do just think that this is just a nice kidsfamily movie that you wont have any problems with  The Baron to me is a bit like Sherlock Holmes with his British accent and mannerisms the only thing I was a bit disappointed about was that the plot from Whisper of the Heartthe movie that The Cat Returns is a spinoff of isnt picked up with his missing girlfriend which is a shame  But if you havent watched the previous film then you dont need to worry about that also you dont need to have watched Whisper of the Heart to watch this film there isnt all that much that connects them  I liked the protagonist Haru she did have her assertive moments but then there were also moments where I felt like she was the damsel in distress which I thought went a bit against her character   This movie is suitable for everyone it has nothing upsetting or inappropriate in it and I could imagine myself liking it from as young as when I was in nursery  Overall this is just a heartwarming movie that to me is nothing all that original or differenthence the three star rating but would definitely be a nice one for kids or families to watch as a short fun film,7
250619,627번,The Cat Returns,7,The Cat Returns is a very interesting movie The cats in my opinion are a little creepy but later in the movie I got used to them It has romance in it  which I didnt like Some cats get thrown out windows which is a little scary One of the main characters almost died and that also scared me But overall the movie is really funny and a good family movie,1
250620,627번,The Cat Returns,7,The Cat Returns deserves five stars for its quirky characters cute cats and its theme  The main theme was definitely hidden and I found it  I noticed the characters seem to depend on if someone is cool or not  Haru the main character starts the movie with being late and gets in trouble  She is walking home from school and sees a cat in the street and a big truck is going towards the cat and Haru saves him with her lacrosse stick  Will Haru regret this decision when she finds out who she saved Will she regret listening to the whisper from above And will she regret Calling another cat Moota fat,8
250621,627번,The Cat Returns,7,This is another lovely masterpiece from Ghibli This visually pleasing story about a girl who is swept away to the kingdom of cats after rescuing their prince is a hilarious adorable film that I would definitely recommend   Although there is a slight amount of adult humor that will go over kids heads it is one of the cutest and most memorable films of the genre  10 is quite extreme,4
250622,627번,The Cat Returns,7,While The Cat Returns is Studio Ghiblis shortest feature film to date 11 mins shorter than My Neighbor Totoro its worth a watch if you like humour excitement and talking cats  ADVISORY Not much scariness or violence two cats have a short sword duel with no notable injuries the lower half of a tower is blown but the upper half doesnt collapse and noone on top or ground is hurt two cats are thrown out of a window but they are not seen getting hurt  Little to no swearing a character confesses she has a crush and the main storyline is about the main character being forced to marry a cat but there is absolutely no sex in the movie cats are seen drinking something in a feast but its not stated to be alcohol  The main positive message is about believing in yourself and accepting yourself as who you are  REVIEW This lesser known Studio Ghibli film surprised me positively with its lightness humour and simple but beautiful animation style  The characters are well done from Harus insecure awkwardness to the Barons gentleman calmness and Mutas flippant streetmans speech   While The Cat Returns lacks the high stakes breathtaking art and long running time of other Ghibli films sometimes its just relaxing to forget the world around you for little over an hour and dive into the magical nonsense of the Kingdom of Cats,7
250623,627번,The Cat Returns,7,This films style is ridiculous and hilarious  It is about a teenage girl named Haru who saves a cat who then talked to her   She is then introduced by a bunch of talking cats to the Cat Kingdom  Along the way she meets a living crow statue and living humanoid cat mannequin  The movie is laughoutloud hilarious throughout  I could probably watch it again and again  Its hilarious because of the ridiculousness of the situations from talking cats showering Haru with gifts that only cats like and wanting Haru to marry the cat prince just for saving one of their cats and the dialogue that the cats engage in with Haru and each other  Its like My Neighbor Totoro with a lot of unintentional humor of the sobaditsgood type but it also has lots of intentional humor which is all good as well  The way they did the English dub wasnt half bad  It actually sounded like the way people would speak in English  The visual style was good too looking colorful the outlines being thin and the characters looking almost realistic  The storys plot wasnt too complex but it was still good  I was able to identify a clear threeact structure but it was fast paced and always funny  The characters are good  Theres the grumpy fat cat Muta the outofhismind Cat King the fish out of water Haru and many others  The story is good but the real standout is the humor  You have to see this movie to believe how good it is  One last thing Why is this movie called The Cat Returns When was the first time the cat came But thats just the title not the movie itself  Why did Common Sense give this movie a 10 rating Its perfectly fine for kids,22
250624,627번,The Cat Returns,7,The cat returns is a fantasy adventure film in the classic studio ghibli mold  It has great characters and has a positive message about believing in yourself and helping others  There is some fantasy violence and mild peril but nothing too scary  If you like cats youll love this film,4
250625,627번,The Cat Returns,7,The Cat Returns is a heartwarming epic adventure  There is a little bit of fighting a few cats are thrown out a window and muta  is shown stuck in a big bowl of catnip jelly  Haru talks about a crush on a boy and falls in love with Baron  Language is not a problem just some words like idiot and fatso,4
251017,643번,The Croods,6,This is a really good movie  It could be scary for younger audiences but it tells a great story with a lot of adventure,2
251018,643번,The Croods,6,Not very memorable film with somewhat unlikeable charactersrushed plotand unfunny humorbut at least the anmation and voice acting save the day here,1
251019,643번,The Croods,6,there isnt anything wrong except when grug tells  the story and at the end when he says DIEEEEEEEEEE thats kind of dark but other than that its good,1
251020,643번,The Croods,6,Great movie why is everyone saying its violent it really isnt it is pg 13 for a reason great movie I loved it when I was younger,1
251021,643번,The Croods,6,Isnt too much violence  Just a little here and there like a couple Tiger bites  No cussing or sex,3
251022,643번,The Croods,6,If you are working put this movie on the TV for your kidsThey will not disturb you,2
251023,643번,The Croods,6,THE CROODS holds strong messages about family but parents may need to know that there are some scenes that may scare young children,1
251024,643번,The Croods,6,Its my favorite movie in the whole entire universe  I love it the most  I think its funny,3
251836,684번,The Founder,8,At first I really despised the ending  The ending showed how if you have perserverance you can crush other peoples dreams  I didnt like that because I thought they were celebrating it  But if you look at it like a cautionary tale its a mighty fun ride,4
251837,684번,The Founder,8,I personally really liked this movie although it had words like F   KS   T and ass it had a strong message of persevere  and love,1
251838,684번,The Founder,8,The movie The Founder is a very well made film about the coming of McDonalds  It is not the most charming story as the main character steals ideas and breaks contracts to get ahead and beat other people  Although it displays a message that you can do anything you can dream of at any age,3
251839,684번,The Founder,8,Howit starts put as ray just selling his invention to him becoming more of a villian in the movie  He divorces his wife and puts the original mcdonalda out of business  Definitely puts a different eye on why not to go to mc donalds ontop of that its fake and unhealthy foods,3
251840,684번,The Founder,8,I really enjoyed this movie  Though somewhat selfish and not a great role model Ray Kroc does show tremendous work ethic and perseverance and keeps fighting for his vision until it is realized  Overall the movie highlights the importance of hard work and never giving up,3
251841,684번,The Founder,8,The reviews call it an ad for McDonalds not at all This movie shows the story of the founder of McDonalds a sleazy dirtbag who stole the company from the real founders and screwed them over in the process  SPOILERS,3
251842,684번,The Founder,8,This is a real story about a guy that owns McDonalds,1
252143,696번,The Good Dinosaur,7,Young dino braves nature in lovely but intense adventure,1
252144,696번,The Good Dinosaur,7,I loved this movie when it first came out and i love it now Though i dont remember it being so sad this movie is great though  I believe it teachers and shows that you can get through and achieve anything even if your lost or scared,3
252145,696번,The Good Dinosaur,7,Admiring dino learns positive messages,1
252146,696번,The Good Dinosaur,7,BOO It was very boring dark and depressing nothing like the original Pixar movies  Arlo is a Wimp whining and asking his parents permission for every little thing  Spot cant Hulk out  Thunderclap is the worst villain ever  And the only thing that he loved was himself so throwing Arlos dad off a cliff to a river would do nothing  This scene is stolen from Mufasas death  You do not throw some one you truly love off a cliff It was and remains to this very day the worst movie I have ever seen  The only good part was the end,10
252147,696번,The Good Dinosaur,7,Scared the snot out of me when I was little I would leave the room during the pterodactyls part  Scared me so bad  I literally would start crying when one of my family members put on this  movie,3
252148,696번,The Good Dinosaur,7,It feels like getting trapped in a weird dejavu nightmare,1
252149,696번,The Good Dinosaur,7,Ive never watched this movie but this is my least favorite Pixar movie It is boring childish emotional and a waste of time Maybe little kids are probably like it and teens are probably get bored  Okay the scene of Arlos dad dying stolen from Mufasas death in The Lion King The plot which is not good at all The pterodactyl IDR what is name was is a weakest Pixar villain ever And Arlo is quite not a good role model  Hes probably arrogant and annoying as possible  He was in the second place for the least good Pixar hero first being Merida  I only like is the animation because its beautiful releastic and its quite topnotch but this movie is trash And Spot which is a likable character  I really painful to look at is Arlo and Spot getting drunk  Its so weird I only watched this scene  When I was 9 saw the good Dinosaur for the first time merchandises and commercial I quite dont like it because its boring  Dont watch this movie because it is a waste of time and this Pixar movie is so unlikeable If you liked The Good Dinosaur your opinion will be respect so I understand  Edit For response to my supporter Dogcat  Thank you I really appreciate that you reviewed WALLE But youve never watched this  You saw this movie a little bit in elementary school but not remembered anything that much  I remembered this movie when I was a toddler seeing an advertisement in the theater but I thought it was childish  At 9 I only watched this scene of WALLE and EVE dancing in space  I thought EVE is a boy and a best friend and I dont know what her name is  I mistaken that EVE is WALLEs girlfriend Now since 13 I love it Not childish anymore Its awesome family film WALLE is one of my favorite Pixar movies ever and Im a fan I know all of the scenes I think youve never watched all of Pixar movies except Finding Dory Cars 3 and Inside Out  I think these movies youve never watched Up WALLE like you said before Finding Nemo Monsters Inc and amp Monsters University Toy Story movies A Bugs Life Coco The Incredibles Nadia Clouds favorite Pixar movie Ratatouille Brave Cars 1 and 2 and Soul  I would like to let me know if you watched or never watched these Pixar movies And have seen these movies before but never watched these  Thank you See ya ,38
252150,696번,The Good Dinosaur,7,a lot of you said this movie was sad or scary but I was 8 when I saw this and I was so bored  I knew what death is and all that but I was so bored I couldnt focus on the violent parts or the story  Now that Im 13 contrary to what the bottom of my review might say I might rewatch this movie and possibly be able to focus on the story  If you or your kid friend parent or whoever wanted to see this film out of curiosity in terms of the trailer I would not reccomend watching this  This is kind of offtopic but I had the same reaction to big hero 6 but I was 6 at the time and like I said my reaction was same but I whined and complained things like waa and mommy Im not having fun  I didnt know boredom is a word And that movie might be better if there was a better explanation on what was going on to the kids  btw I did not understand what death is at age 6,6
252151,696번,The Good Dinosaur,7,I saw this when I was seven  I adored dinosaurs so I was like Oh my goodness a dinosaur movie thats animated I need to see this So when we went on a holiday to Perth to see some of my family I thought that would be a perfect time it was still in cinemas So we booked in a time and then we arrived  Long story short I was slightly sick at the time so a lot more emotional  I pretty much never cry at movies and I didnt usually even way back then so yes you know where this is going I CRYED THROUGH THE LITERAL WHOLE ENTIRE MOVIE LITERALLY EVERY SCENE WAS DARK AND DEPRESSING AND IT DIDNT EVEN HAVE A HAPPY ENDING,7
252152,696번,The Good Dinosaur,7,Well all and all this is a great movie to watch with your family   There are a couple scenes that are sad like a scene where he loses his dad in a flood  And in one scene a character rips a cute bugs head off  soo l would make this a pretty good movie,4
252296,699번,The Goonies,6,I personally love this movie  Its one of the first 80s movies I saw and its very funny and the characters grow on you,2
252297,699번,The Goonies,6,This movie is a bit scary but not terryifiying my 6 your old brother was a bit scared but liked it I rate this movie 7,1
252298,699번,The Goonies,6,Great movie ok for tweens though there is a lot of bad language but it is funny but also is action becuase a boy is on a hunt for one eyed willies treasure a few scares though there are some good messages and is a fun family movie,1
252299,699번,The Goonies,6,This film is a must see 80s classic the humour the thrills the iconic quotes  this film has it all made mostly for kids though there is some language and scary scenes,1
252300,699번,The Goonies,6,I wanted this film when I was 11 and I was in Secondary school  I already know every word that they said and I understood everything  A character does pretend to hang himself in the beginning but nothing really happened  One of the main characters does trick a lady who isnt English that the family keep drugs and she will be locked up with cockroaches with no food or water but nothing happens And there is a bit of swearing and a statues penis gets broken and they try to glue it back on But the film shows friendship and loyalty to each other  It shows you cant get by in life if you dont have people looking out for you  Even if they annoy you all the time,6
252301,699번,The Goonies,6,Great movie with great messages and role models I bit of swearing some kissing and one scene with a naked statue the criminals smoke a little and scary at some times,2
252302,699번,The Goonies,6,its ok,1
252303,699번,The Goonies,6,halarius and some language,1
252304,699번,The Goonies,6,I watched this movie when I was about 8  I was an absolute wuss so Sloth is the only thing that scared me  Obviously it was made in the 80s so it should be rated PG13 because of swearing and sexual references  I dont think the swearing or innuendos are a problem because if they are young it will go over their heads and if they are older they are probably hearing it anyway  In the beginning there is a faked hanging and later a dead body and skeletons  Nothing really that I would say is supper worrisome,6
252305,699번,The Goonies,6,This movie is so good but it has bad words like st andbullst and Andy kisses Brand ,1
252330,699번,The Goonies,7,This Movie had talk of drugs in the beginning but also had swearing  I liked this Movie because it was funny to watch in 2018  The only complaint I have is you cant understand one of the kids  The kids name is Data,4
252331,699번,The Goonies,7,Its an 80s movie and rating systems were different back then  Kids do inappropriate things and has mature themes  I like the adventure and the story  I just believe its more for older audiences,3
252332,699번,The Goonies,7,This movie is awesome  I saw this movie when I was seven and my older sister was eight  I remember at the end of the movie her saying it was scary and yes it can be  If kids have a fear of strangers chasing them they might want to wait until they get older  Also there are a lot of scaring words so if you have an elevenyearold that is very immature wait until heshe is older and knows not to repeat them but there are no really bad words  There are a few kisses and scary scenes too  Recommended for mature tweens,7
252333,699번,The Goonies,7,I havent seen this movie in a few years but when I was 6 years old all I remembered was that I was so obsessed with The Goonies after I watched it  Some reviews state that situations are inappropriate but from what I recall this was a brilliant adventure made for kids  Go watch this classic,3
252334,699번,The Goonies,7,I watched this when I was 6 didnt understand some stuff,1
252335,699번,The Goonies,7,A great movie to watch with the whole  family Beware  some language  All the main character are fighting for the right to keep there homes,2
252336,699번,The Goonies,7,The Goonies was OK but there is swearing   Words used include shi and dam  There was a lot of editing mistakes I noticed as well  Also there were a few sexual scenes,4
252337,699번,The Goonies,7,Curious to see the reviews on this movie I read a couple of them  I think the parents are overreacting   My mom bought this movie for us and we all had some good laughs They say sht 19 times but thats what every kid will here in the real world do dont make them live under a rock My mom was very glad she bought this movie because not many kids movies make me laugh This would probably be a PG13 movie nowadays but nonetheless a great funny movie the whole family can enjoy Many kids in my class love this movie For little kids most of the sex jokes and bad words just fly right over their heads usually its not clear what they mean and could be easily interpreted as something else that is not bad  Enjoy watching,9
252338,699번,The Goonies,7,its a good movie,1
252395,700번,The Grandmaster,8,My rating PG13 some intense violence,1
253921,730번,The Hunger Games,7,,2
253922,730번,The Hunger Games,7,I was OBSESSED with this movie It has quite a bit of violence but its not horrible  There is not that much swearing  The reason why I give 10 and up is because theres nothing horrible in this movie  If you like the series divergent you would like this movie A LOT,5
253923,730번,The Hunger Games,7,The movie tells the story of Katniss Everdeen in a competition with 24 other contestants and only 1 can live  There is not much blood but some scenes are very violent and somewhat suspenseful  Katniss is a strong role model too,3
253924,730번,The Hunger Games,7,Parents Katniss is one of the best role models I have ever seen   The movie is pretty violent though it is not afraid to show some blood  Critical This film is a thought provoking adventure about a future world which celebrates a battle to the death disguised as a reality show known only as the Hunger Games  The second hour is very intense THIS PART WAS RETARDED My only complaint is that it is too long before the titular conflict starts  Overall 4 65,5
253925,730번,The Hunger Games,7,This is REALLY violent You better read the book or see the 2nd movie You see a LOT of blood and its more for like a 11 year old or a MATURE 10 YEAR OLD if you really LOVE your  9 year old  up kids dont watch this Its VERY scary but the Second movie is good 10 up can see catching fire D D,7
253926,730번,The Hunger Games,7,I liked it when I watched it then I went to go see catching fire and now I hate this film along with Catching fire  The dumbest movies I have ever witnessed  Too violent sad and WAY too intense  But is there anything good about this movie Well I like the soundtrack and I can tell that it was very well edited and they did a great job on it  I just dont like it,6
253927,730번,The Hunger Games,7,Its a great book full of emotions and struggles  I wouldnt recommend this for younger kids since its got mature themes,2
253928,730번,The Hunger Games,7,There is a lot of violence  This is something to look into because the movie is really all about an event that is all out violence  There is some swearing and not too much but a bit of sexual content  There is also drinking  So before letting a 10yearold see this movie see what they can and cant handle,5
253929,730번,The Hunger Games,7,The movie was as good as the book and almost have the same scenes as the book  You should really watch the movie first then read the book because when i try reading the book at age 10 it was kind of hard to understand so i decided to wait for the movie to come out and see what happens  I understand way better after seeing the movie so i read the book and now i understand everything But readers i dont recommend this movie to anyone under 15 because of the violence and the gore,4
253930,730번,The Hunger Games,7,The movie is fine except at the beginning its really boring  There is some violence I dont really remember most of it but it wasnt too bad  Oh ya at one part the creepy dogs were scary  I think most kids would be ok with it if they can skip the kissing There is some kissing  I didnt have nightmares or anything from the movie  Its no worse than Iron Man and those movies  Almost the same for violence and action  I guess you just have to know if your kid would be ok with it  My mom and dad knew I would be ok,10
254766,740번,The Incredibles,7,Yes I consider this a superhero movie because IRON MAN 3 a big name Marvel movie STEALS the plot point   Look at how much that made and youll know what Im talking about   It has some adult stuff in it but it will probably fly over the kids heads   Also your kid WILL BE addicted to superheros after this GUARANTEE,4
254767,740번,The Incredibles,7,a really good cartoon,1
254768,740번,The Incredibles,7,Cool,1
254769,740번,The Incredibles,7,really good some sex and violence but this is one of not Pixars not little kids movies,2
254770,740번,The Incredibles,7,The Incredibles is definitely worth your time  The plot and storyline is good the CGI is wonderful and the movie itself is just EPIC If youre a fan of action packed films or CGI youll probably love this,3
254771,740번,The Incredibles,7,its good,1
254772,740번,The Incredibles,7,Yep its incredible alright  I love this film  Great CGI perfect acting amazing writing and the plot is super creative and just VERY wellexucted sorry if I spelt that wrong,3
254773,740번,The Incredibles,7,My favorite movie as a kid still to this day a huge superhero fan I have to warn u the robot will scare young kids  scared me but that didnt stop me from watching it   my only problem is the powers werent creative  they are the same as fantastic 4s,6
254774,740번,The Incredibles,7,perfect,1
254956,746번,The Iron Giant,7,Seriously CSM my 2yr old cousin watches this like every day and he loves it  Also what the hell is inappropriate about laxitives all it does is give you diarrhea and help with diets  What Im saying is that this movie is so great and appropriate that even the youngest children will probably love this,3
254957,746번,The Iron Giant,7,Good and funny movie with happy and sad bits   Nice style of cartoons   Happy ending,3
254958,746번,The Iron Giant,7,This movie is an absolute masterpiece  But it is quite dark but thats just one of the things that make it so good  It definitely stays true to its 1957 setting but it might not be appropriate for younger kids  The main protagonist is a 9 year old boy named Hogarth Hughes who befriends a giant robot from outer space  Although the robot is friendly the main antagonist a U S  government official named Kent Mansley is paranoid of him possibly due to the Cold War  There is a scene where Hogarth secretly slips chocolateflavored laxatives into Mansleys smoothie I think this was to ditch him   There is also another scene where a deer is shot and even a scene where Mansley uses Chloroform in Hogarth  The film also uses words like Hell and Damn  However there are also positive messages  For example Hogarth tells the Iron Giant things like Killing is Bad Guns Kill You are who you choose to be and Souls dont die  At the end Mansleys paranoia causes him to launch a missile that he later finds out spells certain doom on the whole town  As the town looks up in the sky knowing they are just mere minutes from death the Iron Giant decides to sacrifice himself by flying into the missile before its even close to the ground in a very emotional scene saving the town  6 months later the Iron Giant is revealed to be starting to be selfrebuilt right before the movie cuts to black  Its an amazing film but might not be suitable for little kids  Its also a perfect illustration of 1957 USA,15
254959,746번,The Iron Giant,7,A boy finds this creature from outer space teaches it about the world tries but fails to convince anyone about his discovery and later the government attempts to hunt down the creature  E T  the ExtraTerrestrial right Yes and no  Though very similar and a lot less content worries The Iron Giant set in the 1950s when the Russians had just deployed the Sputnik into space distinguishes itself from E T  by one 100 ft  metal man,6
254960,746번,The Iron Giant,7,Huh  I seem to have a very long pattern of liking cartoons on the front where the animation can seemingly cover up the plot holes bad voice acting generic storyline e t c  When you start to put aside the animation and put a supreme focus on pure quality you may relook at youre favorite movies and go Wow  This has gotten a LOT worse  I mean a LOT worse  This seems to be somewhat of a normality among todays audiences and this is 2015 so maybe as much as everyone loves it they will relook at Inside Out and say   Okay maybe thats a bit too much  There are some cartoons however that are so dated that its much much easier to look at the very apparent flaws in the movie and not love it in the first place  At this point this is where The Iron Giant is doomed  Sure it may have lasted a little to make enough money for the Warner Bros to continue and such whereas even the current movies will be looked down at eventually but old movies such as Citizen Kane have so much to fall back on even if it is outdated the smart acting stellar storyline fantastic directing I could go on forever  These arent the movies that become outdated but The Iron Giant really doesnt have that to fall back on  The characters are rather traditional and really pushes it to see how moral they can go before it becomes something of a school project to induce good morals which isnt a good thing in movies where the adults have been over that and want to see quality  So youngsters may enjoy it and that alone would be a fair reason to go out and see it but there are even more primary flaws to come The voice acting is also the cheesy moral thing and the animation is very choppy not detailed and supremely 2Dish  The storyline also doesnt do anything creative  Its a lot easier to look over the flaws of a movie if the cartoon aspect doesnt affect you so maybe I should start rewatching as well  But although not too quality the young children maybe five or six adding to the fact that only a bit of peril will not bother them might not be as affected by the issues that make this movie as problematic as it is  Itll actually be one of their favorites if the parents are open to a bit of peril and notatallbadviolence which they probably will be  Movies0000,18
254961,746번,The Iron Giant,7,It was a lot different from the usual movies either princesses or super heroes always are the majority of the viewers  This movie was a very interesting one and teaches good lessons to children,2
254962,746번,The Iron Giant,7,I think its a really sweet touching story that the whole family will enjoy and it is very funny in some parts  I definitely recommend it  Its awesome,3
254963,746번,The Iron Giant,7,this is a very good movie but the end is sad and used to make me cry when i was little,1
254964,746번,The Iron Giant,7,I am 7 years old and I really really did not I repeat did not like it at all   beucause I think that it was incredibly sad a specially beucause of the end and the scene with the deer,2
255059,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,This film nails it right on the head as far as quality goes and even though its not a musical they do homage to a few of the songs e g  Bare neccities I wanna be like you Trust in me   Unlike the animated classic it is more entertaining and has more of a plot  And the CGI is beautiful as well  Share Khan was AWESOME Oh and he was quite intimidating as well and kills at least one character  Kaa is kind of creepy but her scene was awesome no WinneThePooh voice instead Scarlett Johansten  Overall very fun film,8
255060,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,The actor who played Mowgli is so talented and telling from the fact that he was the only human actor shown on screen he did absolutely amazing  The special effects are terrific to    You can barely tell on most animals that they are not real In some scenes it is very quiet but then something very surprising happens which can make you jump  Thats why I think that kids 9 and up would enjoy it better since they are used to movies that may be a little more intense,4
255061,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,The Jungle Book is about how Mowgli Neel Sethi has to find his way back to the man village as a fearsome tiger named Shere Khan Idris Elba is on the hunt for him  The Jungle Book is a film that I feel is  too charming and joyful to not like  There are some moments where i was on the edge of my seat or biting my nails or jumping when Shere Khan is on screen popping up everywhere  The voice talents are amazing my personal favorite being Idris Elba as Shere Khan,4
255062,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,I recently watched this at the theaters on a special outing with my grandparents  Though it is targeted toward a younger audience I thought it was a excellent movie for any age full of excitement fun and a lesson on learning to be who you are  Standalone actor Neel Sethi the young lead protagonist took it all on himself and surprisingly did a amazing job  I say at least four stars,4
255063,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,You can really tell that its just a kid in a green room the whole time because the acting is really weak  None of the reactions from Mowgli feel genuine and why would they Special effects are stunning of course  Bill Murray was Bill Murray and Christopher Walken was great as the enormous fleshy orangutan king,4
255064,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,This movie is really fun and the graphics are really cool   The panther bear and wolves looked so cuddly    There is no language that I remember hearing   There are a few parts that are scary when the giant monkey chases him and captures him and when Sheer Khan the tiger is chasing him and threatening to kill him   It would scare a younger audience but when I went there with my 11 year old friend she loved it   I did not like the monkey because his singing was really annoying   There are two songs in the movie   The monkey sings a song and then Bear Necessities is sang   There is a lot of clean humor that much younger kids would not understand but I thought it was funny   There are a few parts that are intense and make you jump but all in all it was a great movie,10
255065,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,A word of advice if youre seeing this film  dont be holding anything that could spill  You will jump out of your seat  I promise  The movie isnt all that bad though  It had some gorgeous animation and a really sweet story,5
255066,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with this one  The trailer looked gorgeous but of course theres always the chance that the movie doesnt live up to the advertisement I couldnt be more wrong  The very first scene begins with a chasetraining of some sort and it immediately captured my attention  I didnt particularly love the young actor who portrayed Mowgli at first but he eventually began to grow on me  The cinematography is beautiful the animals are realistic the battles scenes between the animals keep you wonderfully sitting on the edge of your seat  Even if you arent familiar with the story of The Jungle Book classic you can still enjoy this film  Theres quite a bit of violence throughout the film such as the animals attacking each other but I wouldnt consider it an unnecessary to the movie  Its a film both children and adults will love and the high ratings that its received is by no means an overstatement  I would encourage you to go see it  Its probably the best film Ive seen this year,9
255067,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,Parents should be aware that this version of The Jungle Book is darker more intense and scarier than the original 1967 picture  It is an amazing visual experience the CGI is incredibly realistic and the green screen is flawless  This enhances the viewing but also makes the fight scenes scarier  A very minor amount of blood can be seen just a few cuts and bruises and the fight between animals feature loud sound effects clawing biting but no blood  One death will hit hard as it happens very quickly and has a jump scare  Speaking of jump scares there are three or four of them in The Jungle Book  Children under 8 wont be able to handle them  The film has some serious gritty moments but also some very fun and joyful moments songs jokes etc   It is an amazing experience with Oscar worthy visual effects stellar voice acting Ben Kingsley Scarlett Johanson Idris Elba and humour  Children under 8 may need to cover their eyes for 1 or 2 scenes but not often,10
255068,755번,The Jungle Book (2016),8,ModarateViolencescary scenesperilupsetting scenes  Very mild language  However the film is about friends and teamwork but the are explained through emotional moments,3
255279,758번,The Karate Kid,8,I think that most kids can definitely watch this although younger kids might find it boring  It does have some fight scenes so if your child is sensitive to violence this may not be a good pick  It really just depends on your child  I think its a great movie,4
255280,758번,The Karate Kid,8,i think this is awesome,1
255281,758번,The Karate Kid,8,Great movie with lots of positive messages  The violence in this movie is not too much for kids to tolerate  Daniel is a great role mode though this movie has some faults  Like the movie writer seems to think that girls are weak and cant defend themselves  One example of this is when Mr  Miygi said to Daniel that he was Punching like a girl  Over all a great movie that has some flaws,6
255282,758번,The Karate Kid,8,Mr Myagi teaches Daniel Kung Fu so he can defend himself the next time he gets bullied at school  Then Daniel goes to a karate competition and gets hurt really badly in the knee but gets back up  Then in the final round Daniel goes up against the one who shows no mercy for Daniel  His name is Johnny  Daniel does what Mr Myagi taught him and wins,5
255283,758번,The Karate Kid,8,The Karate Kid is an amazing movie that the whole family  from little kids to grandparents  can enjoy  The violence is little and is used in the Karate scenes and one bullying scene in which you see a little blood  Swearing is also little with only a few bad words such as damn and basterd  The racist term slope is also used  One of our villains Johnny is rolling a joint in one scene but that will fly right over kids heads  There is nothing sexual in the film except for a lengthy kiss  The message in this film is also great and Mr Miyagi is a huge role model,7
255284,758번,The Karate Kid,8,Ok soooo the actual movie is rated 15 England because of drugs and violence some sexual stuff but highschool era,1
255285,758번,The Karate Kid,8,A classic movie that is appropriate  for kids This website tends to stretch its reviews so basically most kids can hardly watch anything  I that the goal anyway I think this movie is awesome and any kid can see it maybe not really little kids but otherwise everybody,4
255286,758번,The Karate Kid,8,I think this is a great movie  But it is still best for older kids  The violence is generally mild but there are bruises on faces a small amount of suggestive themes as well as some use of mild language and less inappropriate insults such as bullst the GD word the D word frigging and bastd  But one thing parents and kids can talk about is not everything is the way it seems  Anyway this is a great movie that I would highly recommend for martial arts fans,4
255287,758번,The Karate Kid,8,This film has heartwarming moments as the main character Daniel bonds with an unlikely friend and mentor mr Miyagi  Mr Miyagi works as a janitor but he can pull a punch  Having found out that mr Miyagi is a karate master Daniel requests training after numerous beatings by Johnny the school bully who has a black belt in karate  Meanwhile he develops a relationship with Johnnys exgirlfreind Ali  All in all I think this is a suitable film for most ages and in my view the best movie ive ever seen,5
256353,791번,The Lion King (1994),6,I was watching this movie a little while ago and i said i think i might rewind and watch it again  i think in my life i have watched this movie over 4000 times its soooo good     i would reremend this movie to 5,3
256354,791번,The Lion King (1994),6,Extremely good yet sad and scary for young kids,1
256355,791번,The Lion King (1994),6,this movie was really good in 3D but some parts would be too scary for younger kids   like near the end there is some fighting which was kind of scary but it was really good,2
256356,791번,The Lion King (1994),6,I think its absurd that any parent would find this movie inappropriate for kids above 4  I watched Lord of The Rings when i was 6 and I wasnt scarred for life  I definitely didnt need therapy,3
256357,791번,The Lion King (1994),6,I think the original Lion King is great,1
256358,791번,The Lion King (1994),6,The film is good quite a bit of violence and lots of scary scenes but note this film was NOT released 2011  It was released far before that  Its only been rereleased in cinemas  Please get your classics right,4
256359,791번,The Lion King (1994),6,This is my favorite movieand I  think it is fairly educational because of the animals and naturejust as long your kids are able to understand it,1
256360,791번,The Lion King (1994),6,I give it a G,1
256361,791번,The Lion King (1994),6,I like this movie,1
256420,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,Yall really need to lighten up on this movie  Ariel has cleavage but guess what Its barely any its not explicit and shes a 16 year old wearing a shell bra  She has a chest  Grow up  Shes not really a good role model given the whole you need to be pretty to get the guy thing but this is a classic Disney movie made with the classic Disney formula  Cinderella doesnt get the guy until she transforms but I dont see anyone talking bad about her  Anyway the only genuinely iffy thing is basically Ursulas character  She eats live sea creatures in  a scene keep in mind this is basically cannibalism in this world Ursula calls Ariel a tramp when she Ariel is successfully impressing Eric and Ursulas death is actually pretty dark for a Disney movie but nothing your kids probably cant handle  Theres also a scene with a shark at the beginning of the movie  Overall this movie is fine for kids and the parents on this site are honestly ridiculous,11
256421,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,This is a sexylovey doub movie involving Areil and,1
256422,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,The movie that relaunched Disney and started the Disney Renaissance a period where some of the best Disney films are considered to have been made is none other than The Little Mermaid one of the most beloved Disney films made   The story of a young but rebellious teenage mermaid who strikes a deal with an evil sea witch to   ah youll find out   Just make sure you see this one if youre a Disney fan,3
256423,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,This is such a good movie Im probably older than I should be to watch Disney princess movies but nothing will ever beat the Little Mermaid  I wasnt going to write a review but some of the ones I saw  from  overly sensitive parents are ridiculous  There is no way that I would ever want to raise my child in a world where The Little Mermaid is,4
256424,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,one of my favorite Disney movies to date  Great soundtrack some humor and great animation totally worth watching,2
256425,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,I love this movie From the songs to the loveable characters to the hopeless romantics out there  I adored this movie,3
256426,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,Teaches kids to explore the world and there is a lot out there  But there is some innuendo,2
256427,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,This is an AWESOME movie Ariel is a positive role model for everyoneeven boys  She teaches us to stand up for what we believe in  Eric is a positive role model because 1 He is not full of himself 2 During the firebirthday scene he shows that he LOVES his dog Max  He went back into the fire and he risked his life just so he could save Max,5
256428,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,this disney movie has AWFULL role models and a DISGUSTING message  The movie shows ariel disrespecting her father never listening to him and causing trouble she changes herself to be with a prince come on is that really a lesson we want kids to see  and just so you know in the original book where the little mermaid was based on for the movie ariel DIES so this movie is bad please dont show it to your kids changing your body is not a lesson we want to give them,3
256429,793번,The Little Mermaid,7,very scery ursula is very scery i didint even finish it,1
256448,793번,The Little Mermaid,4,Honestly some of you parents need to calm down  Those who say shes not wearing enough clothes really Shes a mermaid do you expect her to wear a T shirt And as for she liked Eric just for his looks 1  She saw he had a passion for music like she did and 2  When he recieved a statue of himself for his birthday he made a disgusted face showing he wasnt vain or full of himself  The music is absolutely stunning and in no way sexual like some of you freak parents are saying  One of Disneys best movies that I love even though Im almost 13,8
256449,793번,The Little Mermaid,4,This is one of the fine movies ever  Ariel is good  She reminds me of the time I was swimming during August  Ursula is the witch who has won the lottery  She has Ariels voice for good which is bad for infants  Eric is beautiful He loves Ariel  Flounder is a comedy fish who teases on Scuttle  Fine movie,9
256450,793번,The Little Mermaid,4,This film sends out a great message that if you set your mind to something you will succeed,1
256451,793번,The Little Mermaid,4,My fav movie of all time  I watch it all the time and it never gets old  Those kids who think that her outfit has to much cleavage then u should watch ballroom dancing cause that is too much cleavage not Ariels dresses  They are just normal outfits  And this movie is one of the best classics out there  I know her songs by heart and know all the lines  I say this movie should be for all ages because it has a lesson learn some risk in life are worth taken that is the real moral and that what the creators of the little mermaid was going for  Unlike mordern Disney movies The Little Mermaid touches hearts of ppl of all ages  It has that sort of spark to it please let your kids see the movie  They would love it  I know I did when I first saw it and I still love it,11
256452,793번,The Little Mermaid,4,The Little Mermaid is like a SAW cartoon,1
256453,793번,The Little Mermaid,4,I LOVE the Little Mermaid But when I was reading the reviews I noticed that some parents find that Ariels clothing choice isnt good  I mean really Do you want her to go around in a turtle neck I think you all are over protective of your kids they have to grow up sometime  You probably dont even let them watch Elmo  They probably have to watch the movie on ABCs all the time  Come on This is a great movie Ariel is a strong young woman who inspires girls to do what they believe in  Its either this or what they will find out online  Disney wouldnt make any movies too scary,12
256454,793번,The Little Mermaid,4,why does everyone thinks its inappropiate 17 and older really this movie is for 6 year olds it does not teach girls to show off their bodies shes a mermaid what else is she going to wear a Tshirt this is a good movie for little kids if your daughter watches this its not like theyll what their belly button showing and what to wear tight clothes parents are to picky about what there child watches,1
256455,793번,The Little Mermaid,4,this is a great movie for kids but my daughter always want to be like ariel lol,1

256514,804번,The Man from Snowy River,8,Review The Man from Snowy River,1
256515,804번,The Man from Snowy River,8,I recall watching this with my family multiple times as a child and loving the idea that this movie presents  There is some swearing which was a little unnecessary but I never picked up on it as a kid and only realized the cussing when I last rewatched it  There are a few kisses Three I think which never bothered me or my family but it may others  A few of the characters get drunk but are so tipsy that they only made a fool of themselves and the main character Jim looks down on them so it is not seen as a good thing  another character smokes a cigarrete but the result is having horse dung thrown on his shoe and is also shown as a bad thing and Jim tells him something smart about how stupid the choice to smoke was,5
256516,804번,The Man from Snowy River,8,One time in the movie a guy calls a nother guy a basterd,1
257005,821번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,Other reviewers have already given a good overview but I have a few notes to add,1
257006,821번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,This is a FANTASTIC movie to watch as a family it really shows deeply people need to unplug from media and is well made  Some of the song choices are    odd and also ONE ANNOYING THING THE KIDS VOICE SOUNDS LIKE AN ADULT  THIS LITTLE BOY SOUNDS LIKE HE IS 30,4
257007,821번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,It uses a basic premise and mixes it with an innovative animation style a few character dynamics and tropes that arent seen in cinema often and a realistic family conflict,1
257008,821번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,I lovee this movie  Its very funny  A few tears of laughter may escape you  It is perfect to see with the family,4
257009,821번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,First off this movie has great representation of LGBTQ people with the main character being hinted as lesbian through the movie finally revealing at the end of the movie Also Autism representation The son is likely to be autistic although it is never actually said  with extreme obsessions with dinosaurs and misunderstanding social cues  Also the movie critiques consumerism and capitalism in the digital age through hilarious gags,4
257010,821번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,When I thought about watching this I was sorta like OMG this is going to be 35 stars  BUT I was WRONG This thrilling animated adventure about a family surviving through the robot appocalypse is a beautiful example of teamwork scifi and comedy  Buckle your seat belt for hilarious actionsequences and one crazy family as they drive across the country to save the world,4
257011,821번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,The Mitchells vs the Machines was a really amazing animated film  It had great characters and the animation was absolutely refined  Surprisingly the film was made by the same studio that made The Emoji Movie  I recommend this for ages 10 and up because some scenes can be frightening to some viewers  Just wow,5
257012,821번,The Mitchells vs. the Machines,8,Well for a movie enthusiast who loves watching all sorts of films would say this TRULY is one best movies Ive Seen In Years The Mitchells vs the Machines is a Great Funny Family Film that would be great for all AGES  I think even as a 14 year old I find this film better than most of the Pixar Movies  It truly is a MustSee Film to Watch,4
257258,836번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,I watched this since I was like 5 but it scared me until I was 12  I was seriously horrified and couldnt watch this is Halloween without having nightmares for weeks  Now as a 14 year old I love all the tim burton movies with my whole heart,3
257259,836번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,its fine   I like how its stopmotion and that its directed by henrey selik who also directed Coraline aka the greatest most amazing beautiful emotional fantastic masterpeice which im watching right now   In other words go watch Coraline instead,3
257260,836번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,The Nightmare before Christmas is such a great Tim Burton movie and for those who says its scary inappropriate and creepy youre crazy  Rebecca Spark is Crazybutt This film has the incredible luxury of being a holiday film that is viewable for TWO different holidays or year round if you desire  It is shown on TV during October and December and occasionally November as well  Been heard of Henry Selick directed this movie he also directed Coraline  I saw it since when I was 7 watching Haunted Mansion holiday and I watched both Henry Selick films  Even I watched Corpse Bride I drew both Emily and Sally and both are Tim Burton  Holly R have been a fan of watching this movie since she was 5 and it was still newish  It takes a special kind of smaller child to not feel scared of everything in todays world but this has just the right amount of scares and humor  Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King and a mascot for Halloween who is becoming tired of the same old Halloween stuff every year  He stumbles across the world of Christmas and becomes intrigued by Santa and all the happiness that is in Christmas so he decides that he wants to be Santa  Its a fun spooky and jolly holiday movie with a Oogie Boogie Man who isnt really scary because he is just a sackbag that has eyes and a mouth  He has bugs inside his body  He might scare very sensitive children but if your kids are not sensitive and can handle similar movies like Corpse Bride then by all means this is for them  The stopmotion animation is great good plot great music cool ghoul characters and some characters are good role models especially Sally  I like when he explains Christmas  My favorite scene is when Fanfavorite Jack disguises as Sandy Claus and pranks all children for presents  Its funny Though Disney plus have parental guidance when you played the movie  I have a art teacher who is a fan of Tim Burton  I recommend for ages 7 because of some scenes can be frightening for sensitive younger viewers but older can handle it  Great Tim Burton,22
257261,836번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,This movie has a great story and great animation  It has a tad bit of violence but other than that it is a wonderful film  The characters are great and the story is perfect  This is one of Disneys best films  No language or anything inappropriate  Great film over all,6
257262,836번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,Parents need to know that unlike most Tim Burton films this movie is for kids  Some stuff that might creep out kids such as ripping off arms spiders bats and monsters  One character opens up his head  Wonderful family movie,4
257263,836번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,There is nothing wrong with it and the claymation is beautiful  the main character does try to steal christmas but sees the error of his ways   The people in halloween town are all monsters but none of them are scary  the main character is a skeleton and he takes off his head once or twice,4
257264,836번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,Really good movie,1
257265,836번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,This is a great movie but kinda gross  Theres a song at the start the shows a load of creepy deformed monsters singing about Halloween  Good movie but 5 and below need to wait one or two years for some of it,3
257266,836번,The Nightmare Before Christmas,7,Good thing it was rated PG   It was scarier than I thought   Kids should be 8 to watch it alone 7 to watch it with an adult   If kids dont like scary stuff then dont watch this movie,4
257650,845번,The Office,7,This show is possibly the best comedy ever There is light cursing damn hell bitch ass crap and there are a few drug references Dwight finds a joint in the parking lot Ryan gets addicted to cocaine both are played for laughs lots of sex references and talk of genitals and finally a small amount of violence  Its all played for laughs but some younger kids could imitate some of the dumb stuff Michael Dwight and Andy do  Jump off a building into a box throw scissors at each other throw watermelon at cars off the top of a building  The show is hilarious and I would 100 recommend it to anyone,5
257651,845번,The Office,7,often offensive show that holds up in some areas and plunges head first in others  your child has to be mature enough to understand the weight of some of the jokes and has to know that many of the jokes are offensive and that some of the actual beliefs behind the jokes are dangerous to actually believe in,2
257652,845번,The Office,7,The Office is a great show  There are a fair number of inappropriate jokes and references so if you were going to watch solo I would recommend for 12  However if an adult will watch with you I would okay it for 1011 year olds as well  My 10 year old sister and I watched it with our mom and it was fine  However before letting your 10 year old watch it you should know that there are several thats what she said jokes as well as a few about race and sex there are several references to sex and having sex one of the characters Meredith is an alcoholic some characters smoke and there is some language  Anything too inappropriate is bleeped out but there are damns and dammits as well as a few other not so nice words  If none of the above is an issue for you then great let your kid watch The Office,7
257653,845번,The Office,7,My brother used to watch The office before after it leaves Netflix USA at the end of the year and its available on peacock now  I watched it because its not that badly after they talk about sex theres swearing like sort of st nor maybe some dirty stuff words but some F bombs may be use in this show right now  OK for 14 or 15 should be watchin this,3
257654,845번,The Office,7,I love this show and think that it is totally appropriate to kids 13 and up  But it is a bit awkward to watch with parents,2
257655,845번,The Office,7,Most mature jokes just go over your head  Some episodes are inappropriate with sx jokes and racy jokes but overall its an amazing comedy romance and family show,2
257656,845번,The Office,7,I love this show but there are some not safe for work  jokes however Evan though my rating says 12 but it really depends if your child has been through 7th grade health  education,1
257657,845번,The Office,7,This is the absolute funniest show Ive ever seen the characters are relatable yet hilarious great plotlines for a comedy lots of  great improvision starts to decline once sabre purchases Dunder Mifflin still hilarious ending was great,1
257658,845번,The Office,7,iffy but funny and good,1
258865,874번,The Polar Express,6,This was not a good movie  I watched it as a teenager and even found it too creepy I would think little kids would be terrified  It is very unrealistic the conductor is mean and irresponsible and it included many unnecessarily scary sceens ghost on roof puppet room train out of control lost ticket even the beginning with the shaking as the train arrives  Our family watched it thinking it would be a cheerful and holiday movie for young children but it was creepy   Not even the elves were cute The only thing that was relatively sweet about the movie was the friendship between the three kids and the messages of kindness and friendship  I wasnt scared but I would imaging young children would be quite scared its not a good movie for little kids  I would recommend that nobody regardless of age watch the movie,8
258866,874번,The Polar Express,6,This movie is a great movie for all ages it shows all the importance in christmas than  just getting gifts  and santa  Christmas is jesuss birthday and should teach you the importance in family life,2
258867,874번,The Polar Express,6,in the boys house there is never light just dark and the train is way too loud  Please dude gimme a better movie,2
258868,874번,The Polar Express,6,This film contains positive messages role models  THE POLAR EXPRESS is a fun movie for kids aged 6 and up,2
258869,874번,The Polar Express,6,You shouldnt be worried about this AT all no bad language no other stuff and any intended scariness is just yelling with anger  This was the first movie I watched when I was 2 and I still love it Great role models and messages of the right thing to do not only for yourself but to help other people too,3
258870,874번,The Polar Express,6,I love the positive message and the roles that family play in this film   I loved the characters and the story about traveling on an express train to the north pole and going through some twist and turns just to be the first kid ever to receive the first gift,2
258871,874번,The Polar Express,6,My all time favorite christmas movie,2
258872,874번,The Polar Express,6,This is the best Christmas movie ever Me and my family watch this every year  I always feel like I am on Christmas Eve night when I watch this movie and it makes every kid ready for the night before Christmas  It teaches a lesson about how you do not need to see something to believe in it  You should believe in something because you feel it is right  It also teaches the true meaning of Christmas and shows the time spent with family and all the Christmas activities  This is my favorite movie ever I would recommend this to everyone Please give yourself a great Christmas treat and go watch it right now,9
258873,874번,The Polar Express,6,greatest movie ever great christmas film for little kids  five stars up but only at christmastime,4
259296,880번,The Princess Bride,7,This movie is not remotely bad  The stakes are always high and Wesley the protagonist befriends many previous enemies including Inigo Montoya who is out for revenge  His father was killed by a man with six fingers on one hand  He practices a phrase every day  Wesley also befriends Fezzick a giant man who helps Wesley in every way possible  Princess Buttercup is being forced to marry against her will so Wesley Inigo and Fezzick go on a long quest to rescue her from Prince Humperdink and the six fingered man  There is no swearing but there is a small amount of drinking,7
259297,880번,The Princess Bride,7,I will say  I get scared easily by movies  But I think that this movie has too much violence  Bad people put a good man into a torture machine the princess is planning to commit suicide a man sticks a knife into anothers stomach This movie gave me nightmares for a while after I saw it   Not a bad movie unless youre too young when you watch it and then its just awful,4
259298,880번,The Princess Bride,7,This movie is one of my favorites Its not to violent and its great Barely to little sex a man makes a comment about a princesss breasts will go over kids heads the swearing is very mild Jesuss name is misused once briefly    Son of a btch used once  I would say WITH PARENTS a six year old could watch it  Keep in mind its rated PG,7
259299,880번,The Princess Bride,7,Very entertaining and funny  Quite a lot of kissing though,2
259300,880번,The Princess Bride,7,This is one of the best movies of all time Cary Elwes is the BEST in this movie  Other than men in tights If anything I would say its kind of violent  In the Fire Swamp the princess dress gets on fire but it is quickly put out with nobody injured  In the same scene Wesley Cary Elwes is attacked by an ROUSRodent of unusual size and bit twice by a giant rat that might seem a little scarey  Once in the arm and another time in the shoulder  He screams in pain and eventually sets the rat on fire  It moans and Wesley stabs it three times to put it out of its misery  Wesley and the princess share quite a few passionate kisses  A bad guy is poisoned but it is very silly   Lots of talk of torture  One reference to the princess breasts  Iningo Montoya gets stabbed at least three times  Then he stabs his enemy at least three times and kills him  Two torture scenes in the pit of despair  Son of a btch is used once  God a few times  All of this may sound bad but its not  Its also a FANTASTIC  MOVIE,20
259301,880번,The Princess Bride,7,Many people have told me that The Princess Bride was perfect the best film of all time and a classic  Did it live up to the hype For me it did not  On a technical basis it could have been improved  One of the biggest problems I had with this film was the pacing  By that I mean how elaborate it was  When Buttercup and Wesley were reunited we get to see more of their relationship but that quickly ends and kinds of sabotages the romance which is not good since this is kind of a romance film  The next problem I had with the movie was the consistency of tone  At one point of the movie it was very kidfriendly then towards the end it got bloody  I questioned if I was still watching the same movie and this problem was one of my biggest issues with the movie Hook  I might be coming off as a hater of The Princess Bride but I assure you I dont hate this movie  I really enjoyed the comedy the movie had some solid performances and characters the movie had a cool story of rescuing and the swordfights were choreographed really well  Ill give The Princess Bride a 6 510  I was underwhelmed by this movie and I was hoping to give the movie an 1010  This kind of thing happens from time to time  I recommend The Princess Bride to children mostly,16
259302,880번,The Princess Bride,7,This is an unbelievable movie and so good  However there are two sword fights one which involves quite a few cuts and stabs and the eels might scare some young children  Some of the humor is a little adult and there are a few instances of mild swearing  Allinall though it is an amazing movie that anyone over 8 will absolutely love,4
259303,880번,The Princess Bride,7,This was a pretty good movie  It was REALLY funny at some parts  It was strange because some parts felt to fast and others to slow  The romance was nice but it was definitely fairytale Not real  I didnt really feel or see any personality in the characters  buttercup was a damsel in distress who sort was just there to be rescued  Westley had personality and I liked him well enough  the three bad guys two who werent really bad were fun  I didnt really see the point in the prince wanting to kill buttercup I think it was another part of the damsel in distress thing  But I really did like the movie,10
259304,880번,The Princess Bride,7,Great film that is a different kind of princess story but still so much fun to watch  Funny and exciting I recommend this movie to all children 6 and up,2
259315,880번,The Princess Bride,7,Princess Bride was one of those movies I kept hearing about and it seems you arent a real movie buff unless you watch it  I can tell its infinitely quotable to those who grew up watching it but the enormous rats even scared me so kids above 10 should have no problem seeing it  Very clever especially with the hilarious Andre the Giant,3
259316,880번,The Princess Bride,7,The Princess Bride is an 80s classic for good reason   its nearly perfect  Our protagnist is Buttercup a young woman who loves to torment her farm boy Westley   who only replies As you wish to her every command  Later she realizes he loves her and she loves him too  When Westley is sent to war and killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts Buttercup grieves  An evil prince takes advantage of this by choosing her for his bride  However shes kidnappedand a villain named Vizzini attempts to murder her but the Dread Pirate Roberts saves her  Buttercup is annoyed because of what happened to Westley but why does he seem so familiarThere is lots of sword fighting and the scene in the fire swamp might be intense for the youngest viewers  A use of son of a b is used and as Buttercup contemplates suicide Westely mentions her perfect breasts  The comedy in this movie along with the action the romance and the fantays make it a big success  I particulary enjoy Billy Crystal as the wizard Andre the Giant as Fezzik the giant and Wallace Shawn as the evil Vizini,10
259317,880번,The Princess Bride,7,I thought it wasnt a very good movie but it had a good plot line  Although it would be a great movie for children there was a couple of moments in the movie where there was some language and really spoiled the movie  Therefore I think that you should not be allowed to watch this if you are 7 or under and should think about the person if they are under 10,3
259318,880번,The Princess Bride,7,Respect for the classics,1
259319,880번,The Princess Bride,7,I absolutely loved this movie I recommend for anyone to watch it,1
259320,880번,The Princess Bride,7,This is my favorite movie I love it because there is mostly harmless sword fighting a giant R O U S s rodents of unusual size lots of humorous and quotable one liners,3
259321,880번,The Princess Bride,7,I think this movie is very good but in the end there is some blood and violenceand there are some rodents of unusual size wich attack Wesley,1
259322,880번,The Princess Bride,7,I love this movie and i think it is great for anyone of any age that are not to scared of giant rats,1
259323,880번,The Princess Bride,7,As stated at the title  There are a few things I like better about the movie than the book is that you can actually hear what the priest sounds like  Dont mark this as inappropriate but he sounds like hes been kicked in the groan I dont know what else to call that,3
259324,880번,The Princess Bride,7,I really like the princess bride  its fun and adventurous  And I also like Westly and Buttercup   its very funny to me   ALERT  caution this movie is awesome   Why I think you should only watch this movie if your 10 or over is because when I watch it I have to skip a few parts because I am not allowed to see them  But one time I saw a few parts that I can not see by accident,7
259507,885번,The Proposal,6,I personally loved this movie  There are lots of curs words and rude words but a young child wouldnt understand that  At first i was worried it would be inapropriette but it wasnt   There is one seen when are stars collide because one is getting out of shower and one in to the shower  Biut i still all around LOVE this movie,6
259508,885번,The Proposal,6,This hilarious romcom is perfect and funny for teens of all ages,1
259509,885번,The Proposal,6,The problem with The Proposal is on its story and plot  Its just plain predictable  You can figure out how the movie is gonna end right in the first minutes,3
259510,885번,The Proposal,6,Haha I like this comedy movie This is not for kids   it shows naked woman and man bumped each other on the side  There are kissing    but very funny,4
259511,885번,The Proposal,6,i watched this and laughed soo hard and just loved the movie the only thing wz i wz watching it with my boy cuzzin who is as old as me and in the scene where they fall accidentally on each other naked was too awkward but overall a rlly good romanceCOMEDY,2
259512,885번,The Proposal,6,The movie is greatandvery interesting  I enjoyed it however the crash though unnessacary showed no sensitive body parts so younger children probably wouldnt even understand it  Overall a brilliant movie,3
259513,885번,The Proposal,6,WOW This movie is awesome There is a bit of nudity but nothing sensitive is shown  The woods scene with the grandmother is hilarious and it was super funny  I liked the movie any mature 12 year old would love this movie,5
259514,885번,The Proposal,6,Not for kids,1
259515,885번,The Proposal,6,This is a great and funny movie  It made me laugh all the way through it even at sad parts because they made it seem awkwardly funny  It had great characters and a very good story line  Might be inappropriate for some viewers though,4
260341,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,I liked this movie  Its funny and has funny stuff about pets  I liked how the main character had flaws and they all learned stuff,3
260342,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,I was expecting to watch a great movie for kids  What I actually saw was trash  This movie was so boring and the characters were really stupid and annoying,3
260343,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,The movie awesome and most kids likely elementary  up should handle it  There are a few dark messages about death and killing the rabbit character has the personality of murder but it doesnt get to intense  One scary scene most kids may be scared of is when the viper tries to bite Max  Duke Gidget has a serious crush on max but it isnt sexual A bird tries to kill Gidget but they becomes friends shortly afterward overall the movie is good,3
260344,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,The movie has good scenery and animation and teaches kids what others have been through  The story is great itself and has good characters,2
260345,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,If you have seen the trailer youve seen everything  The beginning starts of well and interesting but as it carries on you sit there feeling like you are wasting your time  So many stupid and unconvincing things occur  Very disappointed only the beginning is funny  The good bits are all in the trailer,5
260346,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,Several bad language uses    for older kids it is awesome,1
260347,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,This is the best movie ever with amazing characters and lots and lots and lots and lots of humor   This adventure would be best for kids who like animals and adventurous tales,2
260348,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,Its quite entertaining  I loved seeing this movie the first time it was released,2
260349,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,It is awesome especially if you are a pet lover I enjoyed it very much,1
260350,913번,The Secret Life of Pets,7,I heard words like shut up and  loser  The story was just rescue something,2
261262,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,I watched this when I was 9  It was funny  ,3
261263,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,I have seen this movie and we have it but this movie is very inappropriate lots of sex language and drinking and smoking  Barts private area is shown and of course bad language  Bart is the most main offender in this movie  Violence as well Lisa punches him  The most beautiful I saw in this movie was the wedding video there was this once scene that Homer and Marge not seen have a sex reference not in their bed being naked having no clothes on  Otherwise concerning film,6
261264,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,GREAT MOVIE But is inappropriate at most times and its mostly because of violence and sex,2
261265,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,Very good better than the orignial tv show  The only really bad thing is the penis shot shown for 3 and a half secondsI tracked and the rest is fine,2
261266,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,The Simpsons Movie as funny as it is is not for some kids  There is offensive stuff but make sure your kid can ignore the bad stuff  There is fighting but no blood beside Itchy and Scratchy cartoonish  Homer as normal loves beer  There are sexual references and a scene which implies sex  But nothing is graphic  There is language D A S B  There is some gun use  In the end Homer becomes a hero after learning to be less selfish and a better father to Bart,9
261267,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,homer is a positive role model drinking in a bar       your kids will look up to him and bart when he skateboards naked,1
261268,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,I really like this movie  Its very funny and entertaining  But there are stuff to watch out for  Bart can be seen skateboarding naked Bart also drinks later in the movie there is mild use of bad language and there is evidence of violence as seen during the angry mob scene  Its good but it is more explicit than the cartoon,5
261269,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,| and ,1
261270,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,The Simpsons Movie is a pretty awsome film for comical people aged 10  above  If your child is under that age some parts are a little unsuitable with some cheeky humour  Is it suitable for kids mostly yes  But like I said not all of it is perfectly suitable,4
261271,928번,The Simpsons Movie,8,Swears only come every once in a while in the show but overall its usually only says B but not that often  Anyway it is a suitable show for kids 9 and up,2
261930,941번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,I watched this movie alone  I really enjoyed it even if im 14  I think this movie is OK to watch with kids though there are some scary moments and some of them may get scared  It has great messages,4
261931,941번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,I watched this movie when I was 7 or 8 and I do not recommend doing so  For what it was rated I think that it definitely should of been at least m pg13 great to watch with older kids,2
261932,941번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,Sword Fights people getting hit by cars an evil ogre threatening someones family kidnapping a character gets a bloody injury on their knee which requires medical attention that they dont have but it miraculously turns out better  Otherwise good fantasy movie for 9 and 10 yearolds which positive messages,2
261933,941번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,I loved this movie when I watched it as a kid it has some heavy fantasy themes and some creepy undertones  Some parts of the movie could be distressing for younger viewers ex  Bloody bites and scratches fighting off comical goblins with knives and tomato soup ect  But most intense things that do happen are kind of ridiculous  Things  do take a dark turn at the end though with the main character having to make peace with the death of his father by stabbing a monster that has taken on the form of his father in order to make him let his guard down  Overall I think The Spiderwick Chronicles is a great movie for older audiences or more mature kids,6
261934,941번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,The violence is honestly not a problem  Its all just animated stuff and any kid above 10 can take it,2
261935,941번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,I just went back and watched this movie Im 15 now but back when I first watched it age 7 it was amazing and introduced me to the Fae and Faeries  I think its very cool that there is a movie about the Fae  It even includes tons of facts about them  Now for the kids as long as your not coddling them then it should be fine,4
261936,941번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,Look first up the rumor about the dad getting stabbed in the chest was not true but I wont deny he got stabbed in the hand  Now comes the blood there was barely any blood in it except wounds similar to the ones that kids get every week by playing outside  Of course if you plan on letting a kid younger that 9 watch then make sure hell be able to handle it there is a a little bit of fear the goblins are trying to break the circle and the twin is taken away getting pulled by the legs if you watch the full movie kids will get the idea that its never too late to make things right Jared Grace was rude to his mother but in the end apologized  That also when people seem like they are lying they are right so not to judge or jump to conclusions Jared discovered the world and no one believed him which put his family in potential danger  It also gives the trust your gut message because while the decisions he made could have involved pain and scariness and a lot of risk his gut said he was right and he was,5
261937,941번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,pretty violent  my sister ran out of the house screaming because of the blood and screaming when they got scratched,2
261938,941번,The Spiderwick Chronicles,8,There is a giant goblin and he would definitely scare little kids he is in a lot of scenes and they have a big fight and he stabs the goblin,1

263290,1031번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,This film first caught my eye when I was watching the preview of the movie on the 2012 Diamond Edition DVD of Cinderella 1950 at my friends cabin  I saw this magical film for the first time in 2020 and loved it This fourth installment is about Tinker Bell meeting her fraternal twin sister Periwinkle even though they cant meet each other because the Winter Woods is too cold for warm fairies and the warmer seasons of Pixie Hollow are too hot for winter fairies  Preschoolers could be in suspense when Queen Clarion says that if the freeze spreads around Pixie Hollow Life there would change forever and no fairy would ever fly again  Anyway I love this movie Its basically Frozen with fairies instead of humans released a year earlier Secret Of The Wings was released in 2012 and Frozen was released in 2013 This film is one of the best ones Ive seen of all time theres no scary moments at all so little kids wont complain,6

263293,1031번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,It is a very good movie about sisters  Any kid can watch it  No scary parts AT ALL and I am very sensitive It got kind of boring after watching it seven times though  I am more into watching Planes and PlanesFire and Rescue,5
263294,1031번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,This installment in the benign Tinker Bell movie series shows off some serious Disneystar talent as the McClain sisters sing a new song  The reason for the 6 and up rating is only because the storyline is much more indepth than the others so a better attention span is needed to fully grasp this movie,2
263295,1031번,Tinker Bell and the Secret of the Wings,7,This movie is better for younger kids   It wasnt very interesting for a 10 year old  The Winterland is very pretty  It teaches one not to give up and to have persistence  It also show that somebody can make a mistake and fix it,5

264642,1053번,Toy Story 3,6,Even though this is my least favorite in the Toy Story franchise this one is still 5star worthy  It is hilarious  The reason I rated this on for 2 or older is because anyone of any age should watch this  If your child cant handle the scary scenes just cover their eyes so they can enjoy the rest of the movie  Overall great movie,5
264643,1053번,Toy Story 3,6,This was an absolutely amazing movie with lots of connections to the real world and very inspiring  However its also pretty scary and sad and some younger viewers might find it hard to understand hidden meanings beneath the character developments  All in all great movie but not for everyone,3
264644,1053번,Toy Story 3,6,Some moments of gambling one very scary scene where a baby twists its head around graphically The most scariest toy story yet Should be a PG,3
264645,1053번,Toy Story 3,6,Third Toy Story is the best but the most intense,1
264646,1053번,Toy Story 3,6,For ages 5 and up,1
264647,1053번,Toy Story 3,6,It touched my heart  Best toy story movie ever made I feel any age is the right age for this  There is comedy thats age appropriate and even my dad loved the film  I even have the it on DVD  The only thing you may consider inappropriate is romance between Buzz light year and Jessie and ken in one scene is in nothing but his underwear,6
264648,1053번,Toy Story 3,6,This movie rocks There are a lot of funny moments and colorful animation If you want to see some of the best stuff in movie history than this is the movie for you,3
264649,1053번,Toy Story 3,6,This is a really good movie  It is also a good family movie  I love toy story  Ther isnt anything bad in it that kids shouldnt see,4
264915,1054번,Toy Story 4,8,Its about demons taking over toys  Its anti jesus,2
264916,1054번,Toy Story 4,8,its a good movie but   THEY BETTER MAKE TOY STORY 5 WHERE WOODY AND BO PEEP GO LIVE WITH BONNIE AND DUKE CA BOOM GETS TO BE WITH HIS OWNER AND DUCKY AND BUNNY GET TO CONKER THE WORLD,2
264917,1054번,Toy Story 4,8,this is a good movie though the only bad thing about is that creepy ventriloqist dummy he creeps me out,1
264918,1054번,Toy Story 4,8,Some people are saying that the dummies are creepy but I love old time creepy stuff please dont judge me  The movie is good but might scare some people  Read the other reviews,3
264919,1054번,Toy Story 4,8,Its okay but I like how number 3 ends  It also is scary  Who would put slappy in a small kids movie,4
264920,1054번,Toy Story 4,8,The movie ended with the toys separating which is unacceptable   I have watched all the movies as a kid to now and that just should not have happened  Im an beyond irrated that this decision was made  If there is ever a toy story 5 it better be all the toys meeting up AND STAYING TOGETHER  Thank you,5
264921,1054번,Toy Story 4,8,The movie is heartwarming and I love it  Forky is consistent saying he is trash and wants to go to a garbage dump which could be portrayed as suicidal  Forky ends up staying and is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO funny Bo Peep is strong and the movie is funny Gabby Gabby ends up being really really sweet the dummies arent THAT scary  I apoligize for the review I first wrote This movie is INCREDIBLE,4
264922,1054번,Toy Story 4,8,Oh my mercy,1
264923,1054번,Toy Story 4,8,,1
265176,1063번,Trolls,8,This movie was fine a little bit of pretty OK humor but what really gets me is the MARKETING Its gone a little a LOT overboard,2
265177,1063번,Trolls,8,Too much sugarcoated scenes but violence lined within the scenes  Good for little kids But boring for older ones,2
265178,1063번,Trolls,8,Personally I think that this movie was a hit  Point dreamworks The main character Poppy is a strong passionate motivated character Now Ive read a lot of other comments about how Bridget and King Gristle make quote on quote Sexual Comments towards each other  But the thing is that dreamworks knew that  there would be multiple parents that would be dragged into the theaters as the price of their young childs happiness So of course they are going to add something  like that into the movie I mean yes there are jokes like that in this movie but they are so stupid that they just fly over little kids head And as for the poses Bridget makes being sexual  I just want to make the point clear that they were trying to make the characters do funny things because its not like youre 5 year old is going to walk up to you the day after and ask Mommy why was that character making sexual poses towards the other,5
265179,1063번,Trolls,8,I think this movie is one of the most kid friendly things Ive ever seen and I mean this in a bad way because some things kind of have to be inappropriate but not to much in order to make kids laugh  And these songs just keep going and I hate them so much  The end of the movie is just so stupid  All the trolls do at the end is make the Bergens happy instead of putting them under arrest for almost eating all of the annoying trolls  I know that a lot of people like this movie but I hate it and I do not recommend it,5
265180,1063번,Trolls,8,I think that some parents should explain to their child what is real and what is not real before going to see a kids movie So i really think that the parents should stop complaining about their child being so scared,1
265181,1063번,Trolls,8,I was surprised to see that someone had rated it 18  I mean the trolls world is colorful and the scenes are very creative  I think it would appeal to a little kid  Yes the bergen  eating trolls stuff can be a bit scary to a younger kid but its not really that scary  My friends little sister watched it and loved it  I wouldnt show it too the sensitive child though  There are fun lighthearted songs and catchy tunes  It also gives great messages  Like why you should stay on the bright side  And that you shouldnt pretend to be someone else Just to get somebodys attention like Bridget did   The only thing I didnt really like about this movie was how rude branch was to Poppy  After she finished singing he threw her guitar into a fire  But in the very ending they become pals  Branch also said mean things to poppy but I think kids would know not too repeat what he said  Other than that the movie is a fast paced fun loving musical  thats colorful and cute,15
265182,1063번,Trolls,8,This movie has great songs funny moments that would make kid teen or adult laugh   I dont get the too much violents thing everyone is talking about but its wrong  the movie it funny and makes you want to get up and dance to the song,2
265183,1063번,Trolls,8,this is a good family movie ,1
265184,1063번,Trolls,8,TROLLS is a energetic and exuberant adventure,1
265185,1063번,Trolls,8,its bad i mean why so bland i cant believe how bland the story is so is another bad dream works movie so you know what to expect,1
266101,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,The movie added shadow magic that is so creepy  Norys best friend uses shadow magic to cheat on a  test  They unnecessarily had romance between Nory and Andres  Pepper was super mean and snooty  If you are sensitive to evil characters you might not like this movie,5
266102,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,I havent read the books but Im pretty sure that based on some of the reviews they were better  This movie seems so much like Harry Potter  The magic school and the different groups in Harry Potter they are called different Houses and in Upside Down Magic they are pretty much the same exact thing  Dont bother with this movie  I gave it two stars because I liked the singing teacher,5
266103,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,This movie was a waste of my time  Good gracious Ill never get that 5760 seconds back into my life  I was never down for watching this but ended up watching to see if it got any betterto be frank it didnt  Best part of this movie is that there are no laugh tracks if there was I may have just passed out  Tons of horrible humor and cringe  At one point she said Thats cool as heck I will never recover from that,7
266104,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,the movie is great because a girl is very confedeint  The headmaster isnt very nice tho  It was scary for a little but if it didnt have that it would be sappy,3
266105,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,I have never read the book but I realize everyone comments mentions how its nothing similar  Nory in the movie is just trying everything to fit in and the whole movie is about that making it dumb  All the the other characters seem to be just thrown in there  Norys best friend the hoy Black magic Its all just thrown in there and has no point in the movie whatsoever  And that girl that introduced that magic stuff to both best friend was stupid  Like what does she have to do with it  So please do not waste ur time watching it,10
266106,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,I think its the best,1
266107,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,This movie is a straight ripoff of avatar the last air bender or the legend of Korra this really offended as avatar is one of the best shows to ever exist Rios off the fireearthairand water thing just makes me mad,1
266108,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,The first part was great It was pretty different from the book though    But it was still fun to see all the magic and characters  The teachers are kind of mean but overall it was great Until Reina got possessed by shadow magic and became a freaky looking shadow monster I went into another room when this happened  I was in the other room plugging my ears when I heard my sister crying  All of a sudden my mom yelled Get in here and turn the TV off right now When I came in to turn the TV off I saw a huge dementor looking thing terrorizing kids on the screen  I am 10 and it scared me to tears  Not the Disney movie I want to see and not the Disney I knew,11
266109,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,The move isnt at all like the books  In the books Reina isnt a character flickers turn stuff invisible Pepper in an upsidedown fuzzie Elliot is friends with Nory and also freezes things instead of making smoke Sage students dont live at Sage they live in their own house in the town of Dunwinddle for example Nory moved to her aunts house so she could go to Sage Academy Sage isnt some closedoff school in the middle of a forest its in the town of Dunwinddle Pepper is nicer shes also shy in the books shadow magic doent exist they added a introsoundtrack to the movie and thats all the things the move changed and made worse  I wouldt bother watching the movie  Oh and in the videos on Disney Channels Youtube channel they NEVER ONCE credit  the makers of the books,4
266110,1090번,Upside-Down Magic,8,I love the movie  so do my friends  I recognized all the actors and the movie is a little bit scary at the end but thats 1 reason why its fun  whatch on disney now youtube tv ect,4
267094,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,the movie was a  2 hour garbage about some girl trying to save heros and is a bad movieSo in the first few frames of this movie you  see a marvel ripoff where a guy gets 2 swords flying toward him like thor and heros look like iron man and  mt lady from my hero academia Theres even a character named all power who is a ripoff of all might from my hero academia   In the next frames you see a girl being bullied  by a 5 year old becuase she doesnt have powers though she wants to be a superhero  which is an obvuis ripoff to my hero academia then they go  in a ugly base which has the students of ua high school just tweeked by there gender  a girl named guppy has a power of fire and ice and obvuis ripoff of shoto todoroki  and then theres a guy with a power to  get whichever power he wants which would be a ripoff of yayororuz and bakugo from my hero academia another girl who can sing is a ripoff of two charactersuraraka and jiro  a kid who bends his neck is a ripoff of a guy named sero Another kid who is slo mo but is seen digestig an exxesive amount of food is a ripoff of a guy named rikido the start of the movie is basically avengers and a 2hour waste movie  The movie and the ending made no sense and the spaceships were balls of foams with strings on  as if not frustrating enough the ending is just a kid discovering  the aliens were nice and THE END THE WORST MOVIE IN THE PLANET netflix gave robert rodriquez 2 hours to make a movie and 100 dollars I want to point out robert rodriquez is a good filmmaker its just this movie that should be erased from existence,9
267095,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Pretty disappointing   if you havent see the for I guess you can sit down and enjoy it,1
267096,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Its okay I mean I hated it but my little sister seemed to love it I think its really predictable but my sis loves it basically Im saying if your older you wont like it as much as your children,1
267097,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,It sucked  No point   At first when I started watching with my brother it seemed like a normal movie  But then when she was taken from her school to the heroics lab    The CGI sucked  Personally I dont watch movies where kids get tortured where at the end they find out they were only being tested  DONT WASTE 2 HOURS WATCHING,7
267098,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,watch with family members this would be the best movie for movie night ,2
267099,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,I LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED IT It has many good voices and infuces,1
267100,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Cool movie with positive messages all the way through  Its actionpacked and never bores you  It has a good plot and no big disappointments  Violence is very small and wouldnt scare most kids  Though the acting was lacking at times like when the girl starts singing its almost laughable just so ridiculous  Also there is some consumerism as some characters always use iPads apple stuff,6
267101,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Dont watch horrible worse then my sisters nursery rhymes CGI horrible acting sucks and it was so boring I didnt watch the full movie I watched a YouTube review and the plot is horrible this is not some kid version of the avengers it mickey mouse and his friends as superheros and horrible powers dont watch the jokes are so cringey and cheesy,1
267102,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,Fine to watch on a family night wont scare kids,1
267103,1120번,We Can Be Heroes,6,I really liked it  and it was amazing,1
267607,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,This movies great  I feel like this movie is more accurate with the book than the new one  Its a very cute movie with some very interesting scenes  It can be kind of scary times for younger kids but overall its a sweet family movie  Definitely consider this for Friday night,5
267608,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,This movie is better than its successor Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  It shows good messages because they sing songs about what you should and should not do  My little brother likes to watch this movie and he was not frightened by the scary images  I used to watch this movie with my cousins every time they came over for Christmas,4
267609,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,This is a great movie overall  I love the book and the movie but one thing for parents  It only contains one scary scene but other than that great movie,3
267610,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,its not bad my 4 year old sister saw this and she was calm she did not say she was scared and besides its telling us kids to be honest not lie,1
267611,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,1971 Willy Wonka was great I prefer the 1971 version over the 2005 one  Any parentkid that says 1971 WONKA HAS BAD BAD BOTE SCENE11 1 STERS EITENPLUS are just too much of a fing py  I love to reenact the boat scene sometimes,5
267612,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,I was shocked to see this movie was G  G ratings are for pure family movies  This was not pure  Kids are almost killed their is a disturbing scene where the group rides a boat down a tunnel with scary imagery flashing on the walls Willy Wonka is just creepy and more  It was also weird  I liked the Tim Burton version but this was just bad,5
267613,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,I loved this movie so much it is my childhood  This is darker though than I remember I mean the boat ride a kids film A girl almost explodes and a girl falls into a furnace  There probably is nothing your kids wont understand like I did but Willy Wonka knew what he was doing where was Agusuts Gloops seat in the boat  I think 7 and up can watch,5
267614,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,Good movie I watched this when I was seven and did not have any nightmares the night after it  However a couple of scary parts such as loud music and dark scenes but aside from that no violence and fun movie to watch as a family and do not worry it will not give your children nightmares from the scary parts,2
267615,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,Willy Wonka is a family classic its colorful creative whimsical and funny  The songs are amazing the plot is entertaining the characters are full of variety the backgrounds are a pleasure to behold it is just an incredible movie Even Charlie Bucket is a positive role model  It has good message about caring  An only bad role is Veruca Salt because she is a rich girl who wants everything and being spoiled but nothing an issue  These kids doing stuff who was going into a bad game show  Gene Wilders Willy Wonka is way better than Johnny Depps because hes more like a stranger than Genes  Well I like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as well  Yes it is based on Roald Dahls classic book  When I was a fifth grader my teacher let do Violet Beauregard assignment and amp me and my classmates can plot it  Yes she becomes blue and fat  I really wish there was a school play and I watched several videos  The only iffy things about the movie are The implications of Grampa Joe doing tobacco Wonkas dark humor especially regarding what will happen to the children after they break the rules Charlie and Grandpa Joe drinks soap And of course the deranged boat ride  We all remember that and what was going on but for those who do not well Wonka takes everyone on a boat ride a calm quiet Wonkastyle boat ride   which soon enters a dark tunnel which shows images of a worm entering a guys mouth a chicken getting its head chopped off something gross involving a bug or lizard and I dont think I wanna find out what it is and also Wonka starts singing and he sounds progressively more psychotic as the song goes on and by the end he is screaming the lyrics as most of the guests on the boat are terrified  Ok well that went insane very quickly  Though never scared me but these characters especially casts get scared  Nothing sexy stuff but when you look for inflammation like Violet then you may find it inappropriate by Deviantart users because they looked thicc and very fat  I really liked to see the candy garden and there is filled with candy  But aside from those aspects overall a wonderful family film I recommended for ages 7,20
267616,1151번,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,8,Its really nice but there are some scary scenes,1
268510,1194번,Zombies 2,8,This movie is the best Awesome songs and a great plot YOU REALLY SHOULD WATCH,3
268511,1194번,Zombies 2,8,This movie is a masterpiece The actors are absolutely brilliant  Meg donnelly has definitely improved her acting to be one of the best on the film too Milo manheim was as good as ever  All the actors from zombies 1 were as amazing as ever  The new actors were absolutely fantastic Chandler kinney as willa had the seriousness and sarcasm  Pearce Joza as wyatt had the seriousness and the comedy  Ariel Martin Aka Baby Ariel had the comedy and the adorableness The plot was amazing  I dont know why people are saying it was rushed and they didnt know what was going on  I understood all of it  They were probably just on their phones not paying attention  The characters even had character development from the first film The songs are much better too I have had them in my haed ever since it came out The dances are amazing too  There is one kiss ate the end between zed and addison but you cant really see it  zed kinda covered addisons face with his heads so it wasnt explicit or any thing  There was no sexualised dancing or movements like there was in descendants 3  It was still a bit cheesy but its from Disney channel what do you expect The breaking of the fourth wall was a bit weird but if you look past that it is amazing It might be a bit scary for 4 and below ages when the werewolves wolf out their eyes light up and they bare their fangs and claws but it depends on the child  There are no bad role models either so if your child looks up the actors in interviews and YouTube in general they will see amazing young people that are kind funny and good people  Overall film is epic and I definitely recommend it to you,24
268512,1194번,Zombies 2,8,I love this movie I liked this first movie a lot but I think this is even better  The songs are really catchy and I like them  There is some mildly freighting scenes but I really like the plot You will want to watch the first one first or else it wont make much sense  The effort put in to the speech songs and scenery are amazing  A mustwatch for me,7
268513,1194번,Zombies 2,8,Zombies 2 is a pretty lukewarm movie  Its not awful but the acting is just not my favorite and the plot is kind of all over the place  Also theres so many things about this movie that dont make sense like if the mayor reinstated all monster segregation laws then why were the zombies and werewolves still at school,3
268514,1194번,Zombies 2,8,It has quality acting and I loved it  It has a few songs that are really catchy and it has a clever layout and ideas  I LOVED when Addison thinks shes a werewolf but she isnt and in the end her hair glows in her sleep so it implies that she really is a werewolf and in the background its a full moon  I think that the necklace only worked in the moonlight  Very good film and even some parents will enjoy it  All kids should see it but I think mostly 9 year olds like it more,6
268515,1194번,Zombies 2,8,this is my favorite one so far i know there is only 2 i think its cool how Addison is so accepting of all creatures a definite stuck at home watch need,1
268516,1194번,Zombies 2,8,These people needs to learn the definition of zombies  They are dead eating humans that eat other humans not nice zombies  Also there isnt a bracelet to control zombies  Thats so dumb,4
268517,1194번,Zombies 2,8,Zombies 2  the film is amazing  I loved the dancing and the songs they were really good and I cant decide which song is my favourite Flesh and Bone We own the night or The call to the  wild I especially love the wolves and also Addisonwho wants to find where she  belongs its a mystery,3
268518,1194번,Zombies 2,8,I think it is a great movies for kids  Some parts may be a little scary for younger kids,2
268519,1194번,Zombies 2,8,it is better than zombies but i hate that addison just goes with the wolves when shes not one also zed steals addisons necklace bucky is offensive he treats zombies horibly and everyone is scared of werewolves,1
268723,1196번,Zootopia,7,Zootopia is a a awesome disney movie for families it has just about everything you would want in a animated movie mystery action great charecters and it has a great plot  I would really recommend watching this movie,1
268724,1196번,Zootopia,7,Wonderful film Judys personality is a WONDERFUL role model  Interesting and humorous Judys right try your best,4
268725,1196번,Zootopia,7,This moving story tells you about how we should be open to all races and I totally agree  Amazing,2
268726,1196번,Zootopia,7,A classic underdog story Judy a bunny in a world full of animals wants to become a police officer but she instead is a meter maid  After she is told to resign she instead takes on a missing persons case and after solving it she is seen as a hero  There are some sex jokes and there are even a  few references to Breaking Bad but no one under 12 would even notice them,3
268727,1196번,Zootopia,7,From the creators of Frozen and Big Hero 6 comes an allnew original story that brings us laughs love and adventure in this new original film  Judy Hopps is a young bunny with the dream of becoming a police officer despite constant reminders that a bunny cop is a crazy idea  Her wish is granted when she is dubbed the very first rabbit police officer and heads off to Zootopia a multimammal paradise where predator and prey seemingly live in peace and harmony  With the weight of a new case on her shoulders Judy must race against time to solve the mystery and prove that she is more than your average dumb bunny  However in the midst of a shifty fox named Nick her job is about to get a whole lot harder  Disney has brought us a remarkable production that defies stereotypes embraces friendship and shows us the true outcome of perseverance  And after all whats not to like The animation is beautiful the voice cast is spot on and the script is brilliant  Judy Hopps is far from your average dumb bunny  Shes clever witty determined and encouraging  Nick Wilde starts out as a shifty scam artist fox but with the help of Judy he learns the error of his ways and looks past his own stereotypes while assisting her  While this movie has numerous positive messages and role models it has a fair amount of peril and language  SPOILER ALERTS Predators go savage and chase Judy and Nick  There is a jumpscare when a tiger jumps from out of the darkness in its cage  Early in the movie 9yearold Judy is pushed and clawed across the face by a bully fox and later in the movie Nick has a flashback to when he was bullied by other animals  Theres an explosion a train crash and falling from heights  Mr  Big threatens to ice Nick and Judy or drown them in icy water but he changes his mind at the last minute  In one scene it appears that Nick has turned savage and he bites Judy  Aside from all of the violence there is frequent namecalling with insults such as jerk stupid dumb loser and at least three uses of oh my God  At one point it seems as though someone has said hell but they really didnt  The only sex is an animal naturalist club where mammals meet together without clothes its extremely awkward for Judy but audience members probably wont be rattled  Amidst all of this theres a good amount of humor in the movie  Some references such as the DMV or The Godfather probably wont be as obvious to the kids but theres still plenty of laughs in there for young viewers too  There are also great messages about teamwork friendship perseverance antibullying following your dreams and looking beyond stereotypes  All in all this is probably one of 2016s greatest films quite honestly being the 24highestgrossing film of all time and it is definitely worth seeing,25
268728,1196번,Zootopia,7,Good to watch once,1
268729,1196번,Zootopia,7,At first before I saw this I thought it would be a lame animated kiddie movie but in the end it was pretty cute  It has great messages for kids like not to give up  The trailer might turn you off from seeing the movie because it doesnt really show what the movie is about but any little kids will probably enjoy  There is one or two dark scenes where animals are locked in cages that kids who get scared easily might not like  This is a great movie to watch as a family with younger kids,5
268730,1196번,Zootopia,7,Im ticked at these parent reviews  Our 10 yearold couldnt sleep at night  What Your child was scared at a playful acting scene between two characters acting to fight I dont know what kids these days fantasize about but Jesus only knows  This movie is phenomenal best animated movie in history   It shows you that the blacks shouldnt be against whites or vice versa  Were all in this together as America  If youre gonna get aggressive to be aggressive the cops are coming  This is a great movie with all the anticop BLM bullcrap going on  Great message adorable characters,11
268731,1196번,Zootopia,7,Honestly this movie is very good  I thought it was MUCH better than The Secret Life of Pets  Well at least older kids my age might think so  Take your kids to see Secret Life of Pets because for a kid movie this movie is pretty mature  I am nine years old and thought this movie was VERY scary  The animals go savage and act like theyre drunk  Theres a scary black jaguar part when he goes crazy and a animal almost purposely drowns the main characters in cold water BUTTTTT on the good side this movie has really good messages and awesome likeable role models  So before letting your preschoolers see this movie think about my reveiw  But if your a parent of  a preschooler than I recommend you watch this,10
268819,1196번,Zootopia,8,Zootopia was a very good movie  It was funny beautiful and heartwarming  But dont be fooled Adults can enjoy this movie just as much as kids can  Theres even a notsosubtle Breaking Bad reference  This movie deals with subjects such as bullying and racism A big part of the plot revolves around making predators look bad and making people treat them differently  Some animals go savage and there is some jumpscare scenes with these savage animals  Overall this movie promotes friendship and equality,7
268820,1196번,Zootopia,8,There are some good and funny moments and some bad and scary moments  But what really freaked me out was the Savage animal part with the panther and the otter  Seriously I was really scared  I had trouble sleeping  There was no hint of the violence in the trailer  But the rest was awesome and funny,6
268821,1196번,Zootopia,8,I went to the theater with my 8yearold brother and he was really scared because of the violence  I dont think 9yearolds can handle too much violence but 10yearolds yeah  They have the ESRB rating E10 which is similar to PG with mild violence  So it is suitable for those 10 and up  There could be some good messages there,5
268822,1196번,Zootopia,8,It is an awesome movie I saw it just a couple of days ago,2
268823,1196번,Zootopia,8,Note Spoiler,1
268824,1196번,Zootopia,8,Took my 6 yr old girls to this and I really wish I would have checked this website before hand because it was too scary for my sensitive girls   They were frightened most of the movie and cried a little too   The movie is fast paced and its about 90 scary parts   There wasnt enough light hearted or sweet or funny parts to balance out the scary   Over all it was a good movie with lots of great messages especially for what is going socially right now and the spectacle that this election has turned out to be     Its just not appropriate  for anyone under 8 or 9,6
268825,1196번,Zootopia,8,Before I saw it I thought that it wouldnt be great but I was wrong  There are great role models but there are some sort of intense chase scenes and towards the end Judy gets a cut that I had to look away from  although Im a  hemophobe   Overall it has good characters good lessons and awesome music,2
268826,1196번,Zootopia,8,This movie was amazing I want to be a director when I grow up and Im also type 1 diabetic if you dont know what that is PLEASE look it up so Judy inspired me a lot I loved the messages of prejudice and anyone can be anything  However there are a couple uses of darn one use of Oh My God and a couple uses of heck me and my family werent offended but other families might be  Also there were some families with toddlers and preschoolers who came to the theater  I didnt think they shouldve came because there were a couple scenes of savage animals going crazy  cough cough not rating Frozen G cough cough I was comfortable but there was one scene where the whole theater jumped out of their seats but I noticed at least 5 little kids leaving the theater early and 1 kid who made it to the end was crying and screaming Mama Papa in the parking lot  Dont send your little kids to this movie  Any kids who are 9 and older maybe mature 8 year olds teenagers and adults should go to this movie Me and my mom are planning on going to see it again and preordering it on Apple TV,12
268827,1196번,Zootopia,8,I saw Zootopia in the movie theater and the kids there were TERRIFIED  There was a scary for them jump scare in a scary setting  Also there was a lot of adult references but they would probably go over your kids head,3
268828,1196번,Zootopia,8,I saw it at the drivein  My brother totally SCREAMED HIS HEAD OFF and we had to leave early,3
268829,1196번,Zootopia,7,This is an excellent movie for older kids  There are references to drugs and Breaking Bad a tv show for adults,2
268830,1196번,Zootopia,7,Everything was great about this,1
268831,1196번,Zootopia,7,Ok so I suppose you may think Gazelle may dress a LITTLE skimpily but cmon it wasnt really revealing and kids probably wont think much of it  As for the scene where the animals are doing yoga sure they arent wearing anything but theyre ANIMALS for goodness sake   Most kids in the theatre just found it funny  The trailers are kind of misleading I suppose but the movie isnt too violent  Younger children and sensitive older children may be frightened by scenes such as SPOILER when Judy and Nick are chased by the panther but that isnt too scary to cause nightmares  There are also great messages like you can be what you want and it also encourages your children to fight stereotypes and prejudice  It also has many funny parts and the story is quite interesting and engaging  Although there are several frightening bits it is mostly light hearted humour  Overall a great movie for teens and older children about 10 and up as they are probably this movies target audience and also for adults I guess younger children about 7 to 10 may not get some parts but they should still enjoy the movie,9
268832,1196번,Zootopia,7,That was THE BEST movie EVER,1
268833,1196번,Zootopia,7,Zootopia is one of the best disney movies yet  it has great role models and good messages  You should really watch this one its one of the best,3
268834,1196번,Zootopia,7,I came to see Zootopia with my friends thinking it was going to be a goofy little kids movie    I was wrong Zootopia was absolutely amazing and beautiful  It really seemed to capture themes of following your dreams and standing up against bullies it was a very inspiring movie  HOWEVER  I would NOT recommend taking a child under the age of 8 to this movie  The trailers are extremely misleading there are plenty of scenes I can think of that are pretty violent and scary  During a particular scene that was supposed to be funny at the beginning many small children started crying and it was not a pleasant experience for them  The movie was more or less a crimedrama full of action and some comedy for adults  But if your child is mature welcome to Zootopia,9
268835,1196번,Zootopia,7,This was a beautiful movie full of lighthearted witty humor and plenty of sweet and poignant moments  Those saying that this is too scary or violent and sexual need to to put it bluntly get a thicker skin  This was an excellent film about tolerance I could have seen it at age five but gave it a 7 rating because of a jumpscare or two  I wholeheartedly recommend this for the entire family,4
268836,1196번,Zootopia,7,Good movie  Very creative  Sometimes a little scary  A little sad sort of  Liked it very much  My parents and 7 year old sister liked it to  Funny  Heart warming  Definitely worth seeing,9
268837,1196번,Zootopia,7,I think this movie is good for ages 10 and up because it was very intense and scary but it teaches you a lesson  I was very scared when the panther attacked the bunny and the fox  My little sister was so scared that she followed my mom all around the house,3
268916,10번,1 Angry Black Man,7,This is not for 10 year olds,1
268917,10번,1 Angry Black Man,7,The title makes me laughing XD This movie is trash and racist,2
269533,29번,23 Blast,8,There is some language  Just a little of d word and h word  But no doubt one of the best messages and amazing role models  His friend was drinking a little but he later was sorry  If you have kids that like sports but all of the good ones are inappropriate this one is great A great movie,6
269534,29번,23 Blast,8,Amazing movie for boys who like football,1
269535,29번,23 Blast,8,Awesome movie about hope and the passion of one football player  It is just great,2
269536,29번,23 Blast,8,My ratingPG13 violence and drinking,1
269860,53번,A Bug's Life,8,This is by far my favourite movie ever have a t shirt and everything of it their is brief flirting between Atta and Flick but will be overlooked by most children viewers the film has some briefly frightening scenes but overall its a Pixar classicputs antz where it should be at the bottom,1
269861,53번,A Bug's Life,8,Since Pixar was still testing out the CGI technology after their first movie about plastic smooth toys they made a movie about exoskeletonclad smooth bugs  It may be lesserknown than Toy Story but it is as good  It has the same message as Antz but it is better in every way  While Antz was very brown this is very colorful  While the Antz characters fall into the uncanny valley this has cute characters  While all the Antz characters look the same the circus bugs in this movie are very different from each other  While the Antz story is slow this one is almost as tightly paced as Toy Story or the Lego Movie though ABL drags in the middle a bit  While Antz is GORY A Bugs Life just has mild peril  The story involves an ant colony which does the stuff ants do  Collect food carry it back to storage that stuff  Children who watch this will learn about what ants do  There is one ant forgot his name who wants to stand out but ends up accidentally ruining the other ants work  Then there is a grasshopper colony who steals the food the ants collect  The ants have all just accepted that the grasshoppers take their food but the aforementioned one ant wants to get the grasshoppers to go away and runs off to recruit warrior bugs  That is just the almostspoilerfree version of the first 30 to 45 minutes  The circus bugs the ant finds are very different from one another  But they all have likeable traits and are funny and charming to watch  Theres the ladybug the caterpillar the stick bug and others  They are circus performers not warriors but end up having the stuff to help save the day anyway  The grasshoppers are love to hate villains  The storyline gets slow at times like during part of the middle stretch but its not a snooze like Antzs slow plot  Overall Pixars lesserknown second movie is a treat nearly as good as their first but sadly more overlooked  One last note There is a slightly morbid image made by the child ants in the movie that depicts the circus bugs dead and gory with humorous comments from the awkwardfeeling adults,23

269863,53번,A Bug's Life,8,A Bugs Life may not be the best of Pixar but it is still great  It has some memorable laughs and great characters  I would recommend this to ages 16 and older because there is lots of violence and language,3
269864,53번,A Bug's Life,8,It was not that good  I started the first 5 minutes and did not like it  I dont recommend it for you,3
269865,53번,A Bug's Life,8,there is too much ant sex for me I mean geez have you seen the lady bug abomination thing The main ant thing is too stupid for me waste of time,2
269866,53번,A Bug's Life,8,This movie has good role models such as Flik the ant  While watching this movie I notice something wrong with the ants they only have 4 legs and being an insect they should have 6 legs not 4 I fear that this might not teach younger children the proper appearance of an ant,2
269867,53번,A Bug's Life,8,On par with Cars as the most underappreciated Pixar movie,1
269868,53번,A Bug's Life,8,Its a very good movie but some kids wont really enjoy it  And it has some swearing that are mean to one ant named Flick,2
269869,53번,A Bug's Life,8,My ratingG,1

270405,90번,A Lego Brickumentary,8,When I watched this it made me want to get  out a Lego set and start building without the instructions  I didnt know that you could design your own Lego set and people on vote on it to make it available in the shops  Really interesting,3
270406,90번,A Lego Brickumentary,8,This is so fascinating  I finally know why Lego is so famous  This is recommended for everyone who a fan of Lego,3

270967,125번,A Star Is Born (1954),8,Ive been a Judy Garland fan since lockdown  This is about a woman Esther Hoffman Howard  Esther Blodgett who is a singer and works for a drunk producer Norman Maine  She changes her stage name to Vicki Lester  I would say that its got a lot of violence a tiny touch of sex and some drinking,4
271154,138번,Abominable,7,Funny heartwarming adventure has some peril and scares,1
271155,138번,Abominable,7,This film features AAPI role models and is a perfect choice for family movie night  Though there is a little peril the great messages are strong throughout the entire film teaching kids to respect those who are different from them,2
271156,138번,Abominable,7,This movie is great movie and the music is great  I also think the animation are also really good and it was also pretty funny at parts and the elemental powers are so cool   I really like the part where they are flying on clouds  I think anyone would like this,4
271157,138번,Abominable,7,the movie was amazing for kids but was a bit stupid,1
271158,138번,Abominable,7,Good family movie for 6  some of the characters are a bit meancruel so probably not best for children under 5 or 6,2
271159,138번,Abominable,7,This is one of da bess films from DreamWorks,1
271160,138번,Abominable,7,Abominable is a great interesting and funny movie My whole family loved it and the scenery is breathtaking  There is however a little bit of violence but that shouldnt stop you from watching it,3
271161,138번,Abominable,7,This movie is AWESOME I think this movie has a lot of teamwork and other stuff that makes it like the best movie in the worldbut some of this movie is scary and there are two very funny parts in this movie,2
271324,165번,Akeelah and the Bee,8,I was watching this movie with my family a couple weeks ago and just won my school spelling bee prior to writing this review  This movie and its protagonist were very encouraging and made me feel very good about myself and  what I can do  This movie was highly enjoyable for me and my family  This movie teaches and grows many important skills and strengths to have in life such as perseverance kindness practice friendly but intense competition sticking to anything you committed yourself to and more  This movie gets very intense towards the end and is the kind of intensity you wont take your eyes off the screen for until you find out what happens  Im not telling you what the twist is but all the characters are positive in a way and learn so much on their journey of preparing for spelling bees  Not every character is encouraging at first  though all grow in some way throughout the duration of the film  Its hard to create a movie that is this good and intense but still teaches so many good things to viewers without making the film so childish  My congratulations to Hollywood  I hope to watch this family friends perfect movie more than once in my life  Very appropriatetoo  Plus educational value,12
271325,165번,Akeelah and the Bee,8,This is a great family movie for all kids to enjoy  Exciting movie about determination and hard work,2
271326,165번,Akeelah and the Bee,8,This movie is very good I think that this is a really good movie for the family  One thing to be aware of is that there is some mild language but other than that its perfectly fine for kids 8 and up,3
271327,165번,Akeelah and the Bee,8,I think that it is really inspiring because Akeelah comes from a poor school that cant even afford bathroom stall doors  Also she gets a great coach which she has a lot in common with like they both lost someone important to them  Akeelah meets this boy Javier who helps her through the bee  Finally  I was really worried and it  almost made me cry out of happiness at the end,4
271328,165번,Akeelah and the Bee,8,This movie is absolutely great for the whole family  There is some references to death but otherwise it is fine  Also the mummom and Akeelah argue but the spelling parts of it are good,3
271329,165번,Akeelah and the Bee,8,This movie tells of a young girl from south Los Angeles going to a ghetto school and wining the national state spelling bee  expect ghetto talk aint dissing dawg yo whassup and more  there is also lots of cursing including St Dn A Hell bull St Btch and one mumbled mother Fcker  there is also references to weed cocaine and opium  there is also talk about sexually harassing people and to having sex there is also cheek kisses but no mouthed ones  kids are heard disrespecting teachers behind their backs too  and in one scene two ghetto girls confront Akeelah for being a braniac and a smart A Btch  the girls are seen pulling on Akeelah hair and hurting her  this move still tells how to be a good person and to learn who you are  I rate this,10
271330,165번,Akeelah and the Bee,8,Akeelah and the Bee has many positive messages and positive role models  This amazing movie contains very  mild language but other than that it is a spectacular film,2
271331,165번,Akeelah and the Bee,8,Thanks to Common Sense I learned about this movie among others and I loved it  It is a movie for everyone on the family  Great film,3

271626,177번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,This movie was full off nightmarish images and a lot of analogies for drugs  It was terrifying and creepy  Literally my worst nightmare  This should be classified as a horror movie  DO NOT WATCH THIS,5
271627,177번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,Well this movie was    SUPER VIOLENT like very violent Im 11 and I had to look away at the gorey parts  I could handle it but I wish it was a little less scary  I think most 11 year olds can handle it but its going to be more enjoyable to a teen  There was also some uncomfortable parts with kissing and other romamce  It was magical and sometimes even funny but the creepy parts overrided the cool parts  Maybe if I was a teen I could explain the good parts more but it just was eek for me  Recommended for teens but not for kids Hope this was helpful,10
271628,177번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,First of all I love nearly every Burton movie Ive seen  I never really liked Alice in Wonderland but I was excited to see Burtons genius transmitted to the fantasy world of Wonderland,2
271629,177번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,I grew up with this live action Alice and find it potentially the most aesthetic film Ive ever seen  The storys a little wonky but I love the acting and general style  Not very violent but an animals eye is chopped out and anothers head is chopped off  I watch it mostly for the style but at its heart its my dearest Alice,4
271630,177번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,This is an awesome movie but its very creepy  Lots of fighting heads getting chopped off ect  They couldve just kept a playful fairy tale good then make it into this weird creepy stuff  It also might frighten younger kids with violence  I guess watching it one time is fine but after one time Im good  Not going to watch this again,6
271631,177번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,Alice is a good role model but the movie in general is just kind of boring  Some things may scare little kids  I liked Alice through the looking glass so much better,3
271632,177번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,Well dont get me wrong the classic version is amazing But so is this Im not usually a fan of Tim Burtons but I loved this movie Such a great twist but probably not for the younger age as it does have a bit of violence  But I loved it and I understand how people dont but in my opinion I think its awesome,5
271633,177번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,This movie totally ruined the story of Alice in wonderland for me  In this version Alice is too dull and isnt excited and curious like in the book or in the Disney movie  I just didnt like it  Plus Alice was supposed to be a little girl not a 20 year old or whatever,4
271634,177번,Alice in Wonderland (2010),8,the Disney classic is one of my favorite movies so I was really exited to see this one  but once I watched it I was really surprised how it wasnt even a remake  it was an adaptive sequel the jabberwocky is also TERRIFYING  this film should definitely not be viewed by anyone 13,4
272446,210번,Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein,7,While Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein is a bit darker than most Alvin stories its light peril will only frighten the littlest of viewers  Expect a cute spooky story little ones will love,2
272655,230번,Among Us,8,Among Us a fun easytolearn multiplayer game  Generally I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone under 10 as it requires solid deductive reasoning and communication skills,2
272656,230번,Among Us,8,The game banned me for 714mins when my pc crashed it said I purposely left the game,1
272657,230번,Among Us,8,I LOVE Among Us however my only complaint was the chat allowed all players inside the game to say whatever they wanted to and most times it wasnt completely appropriate for youngers  However Among Us has recently had a new update where the chat is limited to different wordsphrases necessary to the game but not off task  This new feature I think is extremely helpful and it makes it so people can talk about the game instead of other lessappropriate things,3
272658,230번,Among Us,8,age 5 AND UP,2
272659,230번,Among Us,8,since the new update you cant use free chat without an account  the game may be safer but it is not fun anymore,2
272660,230번,Among Us,8,Its not that gory as some of the other reviews say it is yes there are death animations but it in the end it is just cartoony violence  The way the characters are set up in Among Us make it obvious it is not real  There is some foul language from other players but chat can be filtered in the settings  Also there are other chat features and a preset chat for younger players  Honestly its just a fun little space game with cartoony violence,5
272661,230번,Among Us,8,It is trash lots of violence and obbusive text,1
272662,230번,Among Us,8,This is a fantastic game But theres one issue that theres a chat feature where people can chat with each other which might be prone to bad languages  Mature 11 children can play but parents cotrocontrol recommended,3
272663,230번,Among Us,8,First of all I really like the game and chatting with others to figure out who is the imposter and people on google play complaining that they cant sign in are not seeing the patches  This is a short review but the game is really awesome  But sometimes I see people screaming bad words at me but other than that this is the best,3
272740,230번,Among Us,8,I first heard about among us from my friends at school  I then found out more info and decided to see what all the fuss was about this game  End result one of the funnest games I ever played  It is a great game to play with friends There are some problems like languagelike Hxrnyneed a gfbf but overall you can censor the chat  And there are some toxic people from time to time but it is great,6
272741,230번,Among Us,8,First of all let me tell you that Im writing this review for the PC version of among us on steam  I like it more,2
272742,230번,Among Us,8,okay please read this thing the whole way though,1
272743,230번,Among Us,8,Its a really good game and anyone can play it  It depends on the person to decide if it is appropriate or not but in my opinion anyone over 8 can play and some younger if parents say its okay  Its not just a kids game you can play it whether you are a kid or an adult and its very simple to play,3
272744,230번,Among Us,8,I think this a a good game  It has good mystery and its fun playing with your friends and working with them to find out who the impostors are  The only problem is the chat  This isnt all the time but in most games there is at least one person that swears or asks for a gfbf   If you are the owner you can easily ban them but if you are not then the owner dosent always ban people  There are also hackerscheaters that sometimes make the game unfair   But apart from the chat its really good Thats why I think it should be 8 it could be 7 too if your child is mature and if you are a parent make sure you talk to your kids about being safe online,8
272745,230번,Among Us,8,i think among us is a fun family friendly game and you should definitely download it you can find it in the play store you do have to kill people if your the imposter but nothing to violent i give this game a 10 out of 10 its the best,1
272746,230번,Among Us,8,they are good,1
272747,230번,Among Us,8,THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER DOWNLOAD NOW I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH THAT THE TEACHERS KEEP TAKING AWAY MY PHONE IN CLASS BECAUSE I KEEP PLAYING IT IN CLASS SO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,1
272748,230번,Among Us,8,I LOVE among us  Im white and people nearly always says  is the imposter  Please belive me white  Why do they  always say that,5
272808,230번,Among Us,8,If you are under 7 or older you may have to be mature enough to play  I heard of people playing Among us when they were 6  But I dont care because I know them  And you can play among us when you are 7 or under because its up to you  Overall Its very Fun,5
272809,230번,Among Us,8,Its a really cute game and has a very original idea  There is some violence present but its all very cartoonish and no blood is shown  There are dead bodies shown but in a cartoony way and the body half cut  The language can be a problem but there is a feature called Censor Chat that can mute out all the bad words  And if anybody is being toxic you can kickban them from the server but only if you are the host,5
272810,230번,Among Us,8,Positive messages 25,1
272811,230번,Among Us,8,When crewmates are killed in Among Us only the crewmate being killed will see a mild graphic violence scene getting strangled or a knife going into a crewmates back  Also players have an option to block explicit language in chat  If you child has it off your child could be exposed to explicit language other players use  Among Us is not recommended for children under the age of 11,4
272812,230번,Among Us,8,I love playing this game with my friends the game has lots of strategy and is a lot of fun,1
272813,230번,Among Us,8,Now while I may be a bit biased I have to say that there could be much more content in among us like a better variety of game modes and what not  Its a rather repetitive game so with more addons it could be much better  On the other hand if anyone is wondering about violence theres not much to worry about  Its not very gruesome  Then there is the community  You can set it to where it censors swear words and people generally dont ask for private information  Among Us is overall a pretty good game but it gets pretty boring after a couple rounds  Im just speaking for myself but with more content this game really could improve,8
272814,230번,Among Us,8,I think it is OK for kids 10 and up there is some violence with the stabbing and neck snapping but there is no blood and it is completely cartoon  The issue is though with the chat there are some crazy people who type extremely inappropriate things including words like  fk st bch and so on   But other than that it is fine,3
272815,230번,Among Us,8,This game has risen to be very popular mainly due to its social feature,1
272816,230번,Among Us,8,I love this game its so fun I recommend the hole family playing it all together Hint Two of the most common colors of the imposter are red,1
