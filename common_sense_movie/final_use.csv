0,8,"-I personally enjoyed this movie. It was funny, the plot was decent, and, thankfully for me and probably others, there wasn't much in terms of sexual innuendos. There was some kissing and a comment related to this topic, but overall, it wasn't as bad as Iron Man. "
1,8,"-Clever, funny, cool Marvel movie that has lots of sci-fi action."
2,8,-A vary good movie. It is a superhero movie so there’s a lot of violence but not intense and scary violence like the Batman. It shows a grate message of a past criminal (in for robbery) rehabilitating in the outside world well also being a superhero.
3,8,-Ant-man is funny and a little violent. The violence is pretty standard for comic book violence and It never gets to gory. Some Language
4,8,"-I watched Ant Man in theatres in Switzerland with my brother and my mom. Unlike most reviews here, mine's going to be unique yet hysterical. My mom kept on making snippy comments, mainly she said the most dumbest things ever. When the main character (Scott) wanted to see his daughter, his wife took him aside to explain all of the pay that men were pressured to do. The theatre was quiet as a mouse and my mom said out loud ""unrighteous b*tch!!!"" 😂 When Scott finally finds the Ant-Man suit and tries to put the helmet on, my mom immediately said that was like from the movie ""Mask""! 🤣 Using the power's suit to shrink down to a small size, Scott tries to escape the CGI effects of a tsunami in the bathtub. My mom immediately said that was in 3D! 😂 We normally watched the movie in 2D! 😅 With mom's comments aside, the movie is a must watch. There is not a lot of violence as in the other Marvel movies. The sequel to it is not bad. Recommend it to teens and adults (+15)"
5,8,"-I might be a bit biased, considering this was the first PG-13 and the first Marvel movie I've ever watched, but I loved this movie! It has humor that was totally on my level. I wouldn't say it has too much swearing, although there is an abundant use of language throughout. It doesn't have any gory fight scenes besides a short gunfight near the end. My sibling says that it is the ""mildest"" Marvel movie in the entire franchise. If you're looking to introduce your kid to Marvel movies, I believe this would be the movie to start with!"
6,8,"-Scott Lang, an engineer who committed a crime he felt that was justified, is sent to prison. When he gets out he wants to be on the straight and narrow for his daughter but having a record doesn't help. And his ex-wife refuses to let him see his daughter because he can't find a regular job. Eventually his friend tells him of a job and he decides to take it. Scott has to break into a vault and when he does all he finds is a weird suit. After he takes it, he puts it on and discovers it shrinks him. Scott tries to return it and when he does he's arrested, a man claiming to be his attorney goes to see him and he tells him that the suit was an opportunity which he should have taken. Later some ants bring him the suit and he puts it on and gets out of jail. He then goes to the man who says he's Hank Pym the man who created the suit. He used it before and called himself Ant-Man. He gave it up when he found out people were planning to use his technology for things he doesn't think is right so he made sure no one could replicate it and put it away. But he now needs Scott to be Ant-Man because it seems like his protégé, Darren Cross, who forced him out of his company, is close to replicating it. So he wants Scott to get into the lab and take it. Scott is uncertain if he can do it and Pym's daughter who thinks she should be the one to go agrees. But Pym thinks Scott is the one. So they train him while trying to make sure Cross doesn't suspect anything."
7,8,-What I enjoyed about the movie is that it has a lot of action and fighting. I think characters are pretty cool. The story was nice. And I think it's the best movie EVER.
8,7,-Ant man is a great marvel movie for younger and older kids. There isnt to much violnce and you dont see anyone die but one person does get shot but lives. overall ant man was a really good movie for most ages and you should watch it!!
9,7,"-Not even appropriate for adults. A man brags about touching a woman's private part in one scene (to name just one), which I don't even think is PG-13 content! DO NOT WATCH!"
10,7,-Ant man is just a great movie and is quite family friendly
11,7,"-Family friendly, unless you consider people getting punched by a practically invisible shrunken ant man violent or bad. This movie is so good and I recommend it. It is no worse than guardians of the galaxy, and it is similar to oceans 11. It does have bad words, but I think that is the worst part about this movie. I watched it once one night, and it was so good, I watched the sequel and it a 2nd time the next morning."
12,7,-I think it's a really good movie for ages eight and up it's really funny it's definitely a movie I'll watch again
13,7,"-Ant-Man is a great film. It’s a pretty different Marvel film, with a man who can turn into the size of an ant. It has many cool special effects, especially when Scott turns small, and has enough charm and action to appeal to many Marvel fans. The film also has a good and funny cast, like Paul Rudd, Michael Peña and Michael Douglas. "
14,7,-A funny one. With strong swearing and violent
15,7,-It is ok but it is not at the same time for 8or7
16,8,"-I did not like it that much. I have to mention that there is a kissing scene, I have watch the movie when it was released, but I remember this scene lasted like a minute of two."
17,8,-Aquaman (2018)
18,8,-Ugh I hated this movie. Just bad.
19,8,-it is only slightly violent and it has very harmless swear words.
20,8,-I found this movie quite good. There was quite a bit of violence especially when aqua man stabs the guy at the start. Maybe watch the movie with your kids because it is very good and has good message s and story line.
21,8,-A Must watch for everyone.  It becomes clear that Jason Momoa is the perfect actor for Aquaman. He's absolutely hilarious and I especially noticed the way that how the actor adapts to the various scene's environment. Really enjoyed the movie. Suitable for all ages..
22,8,"-Dont mind that guy this movie is good better than the avengers movie  aquaman is a hero what do you expect?  For it to be 1+  because i watched this movie before and the trideint its so cool i almost forgot this movie because i like watched this movie like 2 years ago but nevermid that i wish i could give this movie 1,2000,50000,99999  Stars and black manta he is that guy in the ship and  i dont know how he is in that suit but this movie is just so cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
23,8,-doesn't really have anything bad in them just a little bit of violence. Sorta a cheesy movie though
24,8,-At the beginning of the movie violence someone dies when black manga fights aquaman.Aquaman gets very badly injured in a scary way that will scare young people and that’s the only scene with blood and in the scene there’s a lot of destruction. Finally when Aquaman and Aquaman’s wife get attack by creepy/scary monsters the first couple monsters get killed by getting stabbed then more monsters come and. That will scare young viewers. Also there’s way to much swearing for a superhero movie.
25,8,-all dc movies are very mediocre but this is one is almost at marvel qaulity!!!!!
26,8,"-Aquaman was a pretty good movie. I had a lot of fun with it and I was rarely bored. Many fans of the DCEU will appreciate and be fond of this entertaining, charming and witty undersea adventure. Most tweens will be relatively fine watching this movie. They may get a bit scared at some of the more disturbing scenes, but the movie is pretty okay for them."
27,8,-very good movie but a bit violent. kids might find Black Manta creepy.
28,8,-I love how light hearted and fun some DCEU films have been because it being dark and grim most of the time isn’t the greatest. The CGI is kind of wonky at times but it works for me. The action was fun and exciting. The plot isn’t the greatest and sometimes the movie drags a lot more then I thought. While it is entertaining you’ll probably be glancing at your watch every now and then. The acting from Mamoa himself is definitely fantastic and he brings Aquaman man to life and making me look forward to the future of the DCEU. I would give Aquaman a 80/100
29,8,"-I watched this as a pre-kid and I watched it alot of times. Yes, there may be some innuendo or violence but it is all payed off/worth it. I remember this movie and WATCHED IT AGAIN because, why not? "
30,7,-It's a fabulous and funny holiday movie about the Christmas spirit.
31,7,-We liked it so much it’s going into the xmas rotation.
32,7,"-It was really funny when it turned into a steam  train 🚂 . It was weird when the old man was walking , it would take him an hour to get to the control room! 😆 it was only scary when they thought Santa was gonna be gone forever and they pressed a button and the santa made out of ice fell from the top of the control room . It was weird when Arthur Christmas took out the the Christmas game and everyone was arguing over the santa, which was funny ."
33,7,"-The elves are treated very poorly in this film. I don't know the elves name but her head was wrapped in gift wrap and GrandSanta only allowed he to breath once. They also threaten elves and treat them like objects. I couldn't get over the way they were treated. Also,  I read a review that quoted a character saying ""If we taught women to read, we can do this"" but I just wanted to point out that they actually said ""we used to think teaching women to read was impossible"". I just wanted to state that. But the film is still a bit offensive in my opinion as they don't shine a lot of spot light of female characters or on characters of colour. If someone who believes in Santa watches this, it might distort their image of Santa Claus. In this film Santa decides not to help get a kid their gift. (a kid accidentally didn't receive their gift) and Arthur had to do it instead. I know that the movie has a good meaning but it was too predictable and mediocre. I don't suggest that you watch this film."
34,7,-This is a fine movie. My mum and dad explained it is just a film and that is not really how Santa delivers presents.
35,7,-I dont really get some of the parents' reviews because I get the mentions of sexism because the main characters are mainly white men and mrs claus doesnt get mentioned much but she was portrayed as more intelligent than Father Christmas but that was just me probably. Also there is Bryany Shelfly the elf and she seemed to be a strong and not too annoying character. Also some people said that it ruined Christmas for their kids but it made it a lot better for me because I was starting to question if father Christmas is real but this film makes it a lot more believable
36,7,-This movie is totally family fun and cool good movie in all.
37,7,-I love love love Arthur Christmas! It seems to appeal to everyone - adults and kids. My 18 year old cousin loved it just as much as I did! THIS IS A MUST WATCH!!!
38,7,-Just a beautiful story! The Christmas aspect is amazing! I just love this movie! And for the last time this movie is DOES NOT feature anything inappropriate or rude.
39,7,"-There was a little action, but I think 3 year olds would be ok.  Had some funny scenes, and good messages."
40,7,"-I give this an extra star because the mermaid didn't know what a boy was,  meaning everyone is gay :)"
41,7,"-This show is very traumatising for children under the age of 18, it has some really cringe moments and can be very scary at times. and it is has way too much violence because the unicorns horns get ripped off sometimes the fairies wings, this show is cruel to the unicorns."
42,7,"-One of the best movies I’ve ever seen, appropriate for all ages in my opinion."
43,7,-It is very creative. I also think it is magical and funny.  It has some cute creatures in it. It is different than most Barbie movies.
44,6,"-Loved the message, the art style, the writing and most of all, I loved the chemistry between Mariposa and Katiana. I think Willa and Carlos might become something in the future but I mean PLEASE. Katiana showed Mari her favourite place, gave Mari special gifts, they went on adventures. now come on now. I'm gonna ignore that the movie wanted us to believe that (Carlos& Mari) are ' made for eachother'. Plus, near the beginning of the movie, mari even rolled her eyes when zee zee suggested the crush so.... yeah :3 I happy."
45,6,-Mariposa and the fairy princess is a good movie for kids 3 or higher. They set good role models of being nice and that the best way to make a friend is to be a friend!
46,8,-I think this movie was great but too much blood and gore especially when the villain took out the toy makers heart.
47,8,"-Young and old, rich and poor, Batman geeks and normal people, all will be disappointed at this DC Universe film. "
48,8,"-Ok sorry about my earlier review on this movie, it was inaccurate. My mind has changed on several things. This movie is awesome and trying very hard to get several points across (which you'll have to figure out what its saying for yourself). This isn't a kids cartoon, its a teen movie thats a morality tale, ethical, and esoteric in  many ways. I want you to watch this, but only if you'll understand it."
49,8,-I think that this movie is super violent there is a scene where a kid is getting punched by his dad and there is cruelty to animals when bruce wayne young shoots an arrow at an owl and kills it.  And a guy gets his heart ripped out.
50,8,-My rating R for: strong shocking/disturbing violence.
51,8,-it is michael keaton at his best.
52,8,"-It's a reasonably good film, though having seen Burton''s other work, I don't personally hold it in as high esteem as say, ""Corpse Bride,"" or ""Edward Scissorhands."" "
53,8,"-beetlejuice walks into a strip club. He walks in from the outside, so we dont see inside the club at all.  says a f-word. some skeletons, not scary"
54,8,"-The only thing that got to me is beetlejuice saying ""Nice ****ing model"" and s**t but I say Don't show this to kids, they will get foul mouthed."
55,8,"-This is one of the weirdest, Winnie-The-Pooh-Ride-at-Disney-World-like, Burton-ist movies I have ever seen. I enjoyed the comedic presence of Beetleguse, and wish he was in it for more of the movie, and I thought all of the main actors were great. The story is just so weird I can't seem to love it..."
56,8,"-I think this is a great movie. But it is still best for older kids. Beetlejuice has a creepy look that can easily scare younger kids. Infrequent use of mild to moderate language (except for 2 uses of ""f--k"") includes the H word and one use of ""s--t."" Because of the F and S words, I think it should've gotten a PG-13 rating since it was released late enough. But this is a really funny movie that I would recommend for Tim Burton and Halloween fans 11 and up."
57,8,-I watched this when I was around 6 so I didn't really understand what was going on but I do highly remember the fact that a ghost has a slit through someone has slit wrists and the rip their faces clean off. This isn't scary but if you have an easy to break stomach do not watch this.
58,8,-Has some swearing including the F-bomb and others. Not that scary in violence but some gore. Also a lot of smoking and drinking and some drugs.
59,8,"-I wasn't allowed to watch this movie until last year! I don't know what version this is, but the version I watched was a 15! "
60,8,"-An epic family comedy for all to enjoy! It's a fun movie with a hint of creepieness. And though there isn't much swearing, when there is it is pretty bad and there is a scene where they find a ghost hung in a closet and it deffinently made me jump! There are lots of people that have been graphically injured in some way but the way they look is only laughable. There is nothing that tweens can't laugh at and I think the official 15 rating makes no sense and I think that a 12 A or PG 13 (for you Americans) rating would make much more sense. Over all it's a great family movie for all to enjoy!"
61,5,"-I remember watching this when i was younger, and I really liked it (mainly for its music), though the scene where the kidnappers ""kill"" Benji's love interest is kinda violent for a G-rated movie."
62,5,"-We watched this movie @ school, and it was good ,,,UNTIL the girlfriend dog gets kicked. We did not get to watch the end, so everybody thought the girlfriend dog died.  Over all it was very cute. :)"
63,5,"-My 5 year old is pretty sensitive kid, and we were caught off-guard when there was a real gun firing, when the children were kidnapped (and gagged), and when Benji's little sweetheart dog was kicked by a grown-up.  Of course, my memories of it as a child were pretty benign, but found it jolting to watch it with my little one.  We're still stuck on Sound of Music and Singin' in the Rain..."
64,6,-Great animated comedy is fun for the family!
65,6,"-I was 6 when I saw this, and I was a die-hard Elsa fangirl who wanted to see this movie because the trailer mentioned Frozen."
66,6,"-I think Big Hero 6 is a good movie and it is ok for a 4 year old. It teaches about science and robotics. This movie is one of my favorite Disney movies, and I recommend it for the whole family to watch."
67,6,"-Big Hero 6 is a great family movie, packed with the right amount of intensity and funniness. Having an amazing story line and characters, but also containing some rather violent scenes. The ""Bad guy"" betrays the main characters (Hero, and his friends) after his daughter to what seems gets lost in time.  When at first being friendly character, then later on in the movie, at surprise scene, his identity gets revealed after his mask comes off. These scenes/content possibly being a little intense for younger viewers. The main characters also getting beaten up quite frequently in those scenes, (not showing any blood or struggle pain scenes). Also the main characters older brother dying early on in a fire, which could be hard on younger viewers as well. One PART TO DEFINITELY WATCH OUT FOR, is when ""spoiler FYI"" Bay max (technically) sacrifices himself to save Hero and another character. This always tends to be quite sad, even if you have watched the movie before. I was about 8 years old when I first watched this movie, and was extremely sad  when scene occurred. (Just saying) I assume for most kids it would be sad in the moment, then breeze by after, but if your child takes things deeper. I would recommend watching the scene first before showing your child, or bring some tissues. Overall being a fantastic movie, almost guaranty you will enjoy this one no matter the age.  Highly recommend this one."
68,6,-Although Hiro’s brother dies the rest of the movie is awesome I showed this to my 2 and 3 year old cousins and they loved it so much that they begged my aunty to watch it the next morning great family movie great  for kids of all ages.
69,6,-This movie is really good. Like really good. Stop what you are doing and WATCH IT!
70,6,-Funny educational great messages and role models no swearing may scare younger kids intense  violence
71,6,-This is the second best kids action the ending is sad then becomes happy hope they make a second one
72,6,-this movie is so good but a little sad but cool :)
73,8,"-Great movie, has strong language. A touching film  that clearly displays the life of an eleven year old boy fighting for his dreams, amidst all the chaos of an 1980’s miners strike. The film defies gender stereotypes and gives a message to kids and teens to just do what you love and don’t let anyone, the conditions you’re in or the amount of money you have, stop you."
74,8,"-Fair about of f-bombs, but I think It's well worth it for the story"
75,8,"-Billy elliot is bad. The language is not that bad with about 30 f-words.  The violence is mild but a brief sight of blood could set sensitive people off. Some heated arguments. I actually thought there was a lot more sexual content than everyone said. I girl asks a boy if he wants to see her ""fanny"" (vagina) and they start kissing sensually."
76,8,"-This is an amazing film with positive messages about sexuality, homophobia, and a lot of other things. I watched it with my paretspand my 10-year-old brother. The scene with Debbie and Billy in the bedroom was pretty awkward! There's a lot of bad language in the film (f--k, s--t, c--t I think, fanny), but kids swear more than adults anyway, it's not going to change anything. I'm reviewing the full 15+ version, not the PG one."
77,8,-This movie was amazing to see. Beware of strong language however. This movie is about a young boy who wants to do ballet however his father is not ok with it. A very emotional movie.
78,8,-To much inappropriate comments and swearing
79,8,-There is a lot of swearing but overall a great movie!
80,8,"-Do not let your children watch this, it is inappropriate! And very stupid"
81,8,"-I thought this was a really great movie! An awesome roll model for kids growing up into teens. It also showed me that to never give up, and try your hardest for the things you believe in, or want.  But there was a lot of swearing and a bit of violence, so maybe not the best for younger or immature kids, but overall it was an entertaining and often times hilarious movie that you or/and your kids will LOVE!"
82,8,"-My rating:R for pervasive language, some racy content."
83,8,"-Went to the movies theater when it came out AMAZING MOVIE was my favorite movies till spider-man into the spider verse came out(check out my review on that) Mild violence, one middle finger, not recommended for small children great movie though"
84,8,"-This is possibly the best Marvel movie so far. The action is awesome, the story is great, and the characters are interesting and diverse. Some of the violence may be too much for younger kids. There are a lot of shootings and deaths. Michael B. Jordan’s character is cruel and disturbing at times. 12 and up."
85,8,-i realy like this movie you should let your kids watch this movie
86,8,"-This was not my favorite, but it's ok. There is some swearing, but not much. It has a great storyboard and I think it is fine for a mature eight year old."
87,8,"-THIS IS INCREDIBLE! This movie is my perfect marvel movie. I love everything! I love how this movie has so much emotion, and is so powerful, it will really tugs at the heartstrings. It has a perfect balance of action, emotion, plot, everything in between. Most marvel movies have men characters, but this movie has awesome women warrior characters, my favorites are Shuri, Okoye, Nakia, and let me just say Everyone. This is my all time favorite Marvel Movie! Watch it!"
88,8,"-Message a teamwork and loyalty. The first black hero and a message on never giving up.Fighting,explosions and even A death happen in the movie.S--t,and Hell are said infrequently .No Real sex in this movie. It's Part of the marvel cinematic universe.Some Drinking in one scene"
89,8,-Great film. Favorite Marvel film so far.
90,8,"-This movie is one of the best I have ever watched in my life but it did use consumerism, violence, and swearing. Though it had these, it conveyed great messages and inspired us to support everyone no matter their background. It did not use sex or drug/drinking/smoking, but I would still recommend watching it with a parent or a group of friends. But if you are  8+ and understand certain words are bad, then I think you could still watch it."
91,8,"-This is a really good movies for families! There are a couple violent scenes, and SPOILER the guy who tries to take over Wakanda is a little creepy with the knife-scar-thing on his upper body..... but a good movie for celebrating black families! Another thing, a VERY good movie to watch right now, especially with COVID and the BLACK LIVES MATTER thing. Great family movie, definitly would watch again and probaly will."
92,6,-TOO MUCH VIOLENCE  FOR KIDS!!!
93,6,-this is a good movie I recommend this
94,6,-I thought that this movie was good but kids under 13 might have a hard time following it /understanding it. Also the violence was really intense. But I thought that it had good messages and role models.
95,6,-It has swearing and Blood and the religion might be confusing for Kids
96,6,-i think this movie is great its just kinda violent thats all
97,6,-This movie will be good to take an 10 year old out to see a movie but mild language is my concern.
98,6,-This movie gives info about the strength of black people everybody knows that black panther represents the strength of black people and it just says damn hell sh-t and other BUT its great. At the end of the movie t-challa and nakia kiss. but its not to sexual. and the movie puts out great messages
99,6,"-well, there is quite a lot of violence (characters get stabbed multiple times, murder as punishment, etc) remind your kid or teen that this is just acting and special effects. Also, there is some positivity in it. It has a message that no matter what race you are, you can still do many great things. but one part I didn't like was that two characters kiss at the end..blah.. There is a minimal amount of swearing. I grew up around swear words and such, so if you don't want your kid/teen hearing that, I recommend not watching this with you're kid/teen. I hope this review helped you in some way"
100,8,"-I've seen marvel movies better than this[such as Thor]. Although it is good; it has some violent scene. Rude moments, suggestive and blood is seen. I think this is better than Doctor Strange but this is still a boring MARVEL movie. Kid's should not see this movie by it self."
101,8,"-This movie is awesome, action packed and gets you on the edge of your seat. Quite violent though."
102,8,"-Black Panther is a beautiful movie with an excellent storyline and positive role models. It really values the importance of culture and diversity, and supports equality for all females and males. "
103,8,-it is very good and full of action
104,8,-This is a great movie! There is a lot of violence. But there is no blood. There is lots of positive messages too.  I think this is appropriate for tweens.
105,8,"-Amazing film with fun, drama, and superhero action."
106,8,"-Fine movie. Watched like a million times. Knowing marvel movie's this one's on the more graphic violent side but its not the worst. There are several scenes of bloody punching and stabbing, and one seen of aman laying on the ground and is shot. Nothing sexual."
107,8,"-It was a great movie that includes action, adventure and story. A good movie about culture.May be intense for younger children."
108,7,-I watched this when I  was 12. My parents are strong believers in not sugar coating things and this is one of my dad’s favourite ever films. I also love this film and rally recommend it. It does have the n-word in it so I recommend talking to your kids about why they should never ever say this work before watching the film. There are some sexual bits and you will have to be prepared to answer awkward questions that your kids may ask. In conclusion I think this is a great film and it is a great spoof western.
109,7,"-Blazing Saddles is a 1974 comedy directed by Mel Brooks and starring Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Harvey Korman, Dom Deluise, and Mel Brooks."
110,7,"-I saw this first when I was in 6th grade, and even then I got the satire and loved the movie. Yes it has the n-word and has offensive jokes- But that's the point. It's not glorifying racism, it's making fun of the people who actually hold those beliefs, like It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia's humor does. Yes there are some jokes that haven't aged well, like the gay jokes, but the amount of still-hilarious jokes override that number so much, it's still a really enjoyable film and a great satire. And if it counts for anything, Mel Brooks asked the black star Cleavon Little about the frequent  use of the n-word, and he gave it the OK. If people are complaining that it's racist and offensive, they just don't see or get the satire, and the fact that it's making fun of bigots and making them laughable to take away their power, like how Mel Brooks does with Hitler and nazis in The Producers, and other hateful groups in so many of his movies. There is sexual jokes and implications and a scantily clad woman. There is swearing, as well as some brief, light violence. Definitely give it a watch"
111,7,"-Fish out of water flick attempts to satirize racism, but doesn't hold up during the 21st century. There are a few Mel Brooks-style chuckles, including the magical finale. Critics are blinded my nostalgia to see the overratedness within."
112,7,"-I watched this movie when I  was 13 and I found it HILARIOUS! I watch many crude comedies (mostly R rated comedy movies) and I thought this was pretty clean for being R. Some racial stuff, language, but no nudity."
113,7,"-There's lots of innappropriate humor in here. A priest makes a reference to: cattle r-ped. Many uses of the n word, as this is based on the 1800s. Lots of language, such as a rape joke. ""The women?"" ""We'll rape the sh-t out of them at the party!"" Many sexual jokes and innuendos throughout the movie, lots of cleavage. One character is gay (or at least the others think he is). Otherwise, very funny movie, but pay attention to the r rating."
114,7,"-This movie is hilarious, but very inappropriate and has a lot of foul language. They say s--t and the ""N"" word, but a good movie. The actors were perfect for their roles, and all contributed to the hilarity of the movie."
115,7,"-The American Film Institute didn't vote this the 6th funniest American film of all time for nothing. This Western spoof makes fun of practically all there is to make fun of: race, sex, religion, cultural stereotypes, collective thought and, most of all, modern society, and is crammed with totally inappropriate jokes concerning these topics. Above all the underlying social satire, Blazing Saddles is essentially the story of a greedy state official who plans to uproot an entire town to make way for his new railway. The desperate townspeople appeal to the state governor for a new sheriff, and are glad when they are sent one - only to be unspeakably shocked when they realise the new sheriff is black. Overall, the film is a sly satire on popular culture with tons of over-the-top slapstick, but may be over some kids' heads, especially as the last 10 minutes does away with any notion of conventional storytelling."
116,7,"-I LOVE this movie! It's my favorite Mel Brooks film, my favorite comedy, and probably my favorite movie in general. I especially appreciate the film's anti-racism message. I definitely recommend it to any Mel Brooks fan."
117,7,"-Not as funny as ""Spaceballs"" for kids in my age range but I still loved it. Has some drinking and a little bit of drug use, as well as a lot of racism but it shows how stupid people are when they hate other people that are different than themselves. Very good film!"
118,8,"-Super-dog adventure is fun, and age-appropriate for kids."
119,8,"-This movie shouldn't be watched by any kid under 6 for the violent scene at the end with Penny and Bolt. That one scene influenced the whole movie to be PG for me. If your under-six-year-old kid loves action or suspence, then this is the movie for them. If not, don't hesitate to ignore."
120,8,"-Explosions galore in funny, witty actioner."
121,8,"-I thought this film was awesome when it first came out. Since I was a kid who loved dogs and superheroes, it was basically everything I could ask for. Now that I'm older, I don't like it quite as much as I used to. The violence is alright for kids, there is no swearing, and basically zero sexuality. It's also got heart, humor, and engaging action. It's certainly something entertaining for the young'uns. (continue for more detail)"
122,8,-This is a really good movie with lots of fun action. the main scary type bit is towards the end with the treat of the fire.
123,8,"-It's kinda a baby movie, but otherwise it's fine."
124,8,"-BOLT is full of good jokes, and lots of fast action! I especially loved the hamster in his clear ball running around and being brave and silly!"
125,8,-it is a bit scary.
126,8,-I don't love this movie. It is kind of bland for a family movie. Pick something else.
127,8,-Great movie I think. Will be nice if it was less violent.
128,7,-I think this movie was okay.I also think that it should be for 7+ because there were some sad parts like when there was a war between the people who wanted to protect the environment and people who wanted to take down the environment and replace it with houses and big companies.
129,8,"-An interesting movie with an empowering message. It's a grate story but it might be a bit too violent for younger children. The reason I rated it 11+ is not because it had too much violence in it, but because it have a very complex meaning hidden in it. It was even complex for me! If you really want to enjoy it you have to understand it. Overall a great story with a great message."
130,8,"-This movie is a really good one to skip, especially for sensitive kids."
131,8,"-I've seen Frozen 2 and Wreck it Ralph Breaks the Internet, both pale in comparison to the awfulness of this movie."
132,8,"-i love this movie. such great role models, music and animations. It also embodies the importance of family relationships. great movie!"
133,8,"-I would almost put this under a mild horror movie label, and a family film at the same time. I guess it just depends on how tough your kids are with animated violence and creepiness since there are scenes I felt were a bit much for younger kids. (SPOILER ALERT) For example, when Merida's mother turns into a bear, and when she wasn't acting like her human self at times. The witch, her magic, and her cottage was also creepy. Another bear - who looked rotted and beaten - from an ancient story was also shown trying to kill Merida and her family. It really depends on what kind of kid you have, I guess."
134,8,"-I finished this movie tonight, and it rules! My mom said she’d watch this movie over again! I used to be scared but now I’m not. I took a quiz on ohmy.disney.com and apparently I’m a cross of Merida and Belle!"
135,8,"-Great movie. There’s a great message. But there’s some mild violence and scariness. There is no bloodshed or guns, but it is definitely scary for kids under the age of 7."
136,8,"-This film was traumatic for 4 year old me. Children at that age aren't really able to comprehend what's happening and just see people turning into bears and trying to kill each other. However, when watched at the right age, it's a great film with a good role model and comedic at times."
137,8,-scary a little. good movie. very sad.
138,8,-This movie is not good
139,8,-Not pixar's best. Pretty scary movie as well.
140,8,-It has a great plot!!!! The characters are awesome and I LOVE how it takes place in Scotland!!! They use traditional Scottish music in in the movie and I absolutely LOVE their accents!!!!!! You should watch this movie!!! I shows the traditions of Scotland too!!!!
141,8,"-It is a good movie, but it is too scary for younger kids."
142,8,"-i really like the movie brave and there are some parts that are scary and the tiniest bit inappropriate. the main character, Merida and her mother go on an adventure to turn mom back into a human instead of a..."
143,8,"-This movie was much better than many people thought it was, in my opinion.  It was one of the first movies I saw at the movie theater, and I enjoyed it a whole lot."
144,8,-i love this
145,8,-This shows that even girls can be strong. This is about family and is a MUST for family movie nights.
146,8,"-Because this movie is produced by Pixar, it's a lot better than any Disney Princess movie. The main character is strong and independent, and an awesome role model. Unlike Disney movies, there is no romance crap in the film. Plot is exciting and action filled, the musical score is beautiful, and overall great movie."
147,8,"-My rating:PG-13 for intense sequences of fantasy violence, and disturbing sequences of action."
148,7,-Come on my 7 year old sister loved it she watched every Harry Potter too now she is 8. It is not scary I was laughing.
149,7,-Good movie. There is some violence with Merida's mom turning into a bear. Also a big demon bear is the scariest part. It comes and attacks the characters in three scenes. Positive messages: Follow your heart and don't let others control you. Educational with learning about Scotland life in medieval times.
150,7,-Has mild scary scenes and a bear attack but in all has a good message about family.
151,7,"-Hello! This is my review on Brave. I will be telling the story, also if I liked it or not. Hope this helps!"
152,7,"-Produced by Pixar and released by Walt Disney Pictures, Brave is a story about a mother-daughter relationship. I have to admit that when we watched it in the cinema, it was a little scary and there were some violence and some inappropriate content for young children (therefore I think it is suitable for children ages at least 8 & above), but other than that, it is a good movie with a strong and positive moral."
153,7,-I was nine years old when I saw this movie with my parents in the threatens in 3d and I almost had nightmares literally the scary bear action gave me the heebie newbies and I was scared of elinors bear transformation. And I even almost cried at the end of the movie overall it was good but it would scare some kids. Note not for little children.
154,7,"-This is a very action packed Pixar film. I love the graphics, the animation, and just everything."
155,7,-Lots of violence and inappropriate scenes. Also I found that the movie gets a little boring near the end.
156,7,"-i haven't seen it, and don't want to, since a lot of pixar fans said it wasn't  all that good"
157,7,-I am 7 years old and I love this movie.  But it was a little scary because of the scary bear.  But over all I liked it a lot.
158,3,"-anyone who is saying this is a bad movie and not for kids is DEAD WRONG. My brother is 6 YEARS OLD and he absolutely adored it!!! it not only shows very good graphics and was well put together, but it ALSO shows that nothing should get in the way of friendship. there was absolutely NO ""extreme violence"", NO cars being ""Tortured"", NO ""glorifying guns"" and NO UPFRONT DEATH! sure it implies in the beginning that they found an agent and squashed him and yes HE ""died"" if that's what even happens to cars, but no one under the age of 7 could possibly understand what happened in that scene! Honestly from seeing the commercials i thought it'd be a horrible movie but it was great! I was surprised! there's nothing that could be considered real violence unless you count missiles that are poorly aimed and simply shake them in the opposite direction violence. i don't understand what people are saying about it being not for kids. i mean, sure theirs some adult humor but children don't understand it and its for the purpose of making the movie fun for EVERYONE! Come on, sure, it has some intense scenes but unless you parents TELL your 4-7 year old ""Oh, their about to die, that thing's gonna crush them. Oh look, they lied. Oh look, he did something stupid."" then they aren't gonna say a THING. in fact, they just might like it! so parents, don't influence your child's view on movies just because you think its ""inappropriate."" let them make up their minds. I'm here to tell you just because a person writes a long review doesn't mean that that's what you're going to think of the movie- see for yourself."
159,3,"-Cars 2 does deserve a PG rating based on the violence, but I have no clue what made all the other reviewers deside that kids should not see this movie.  Even though there is a scene of what I consider ""torture"" to a car and cars' motors being overheated, that does not make a movie horrible, it makes it innappropriate.  Cars 2, in my opinion, was an excellent film and I reccomend it to families but be prepared for some violence.  I will agree that it does seem like a tamed James Bond movie but overall a hilarious, great Pixar film."
160,3,-Great for 7-10 year olds who want to see movies with violence.
161,3,"-I think this movie wasn't a ""true"" creation of PIXAR, I read the reviews on here and I see everyone hating this movie and calling it the ""The first terrible PIXAR movie."" Yes it is more violent and the story is confusing(in my opinion), But this probably isn't PIXARS fault. My theory is that Disney maybe rushed PIXAR into making this movie, since the recent gross revenue of ""Toy Story 3"" was over $1 billion and became one of the most successful kids movies of the decade. Which possibly means Disney wants PIXAR to make sequels of their successful movies, because they think that will make them more money, so what ruined PIXAR you ask? It was probably money."
162,3,-HAAHAHA! Great for kids any age. Take my word for it! This movie is so funny! It is a suggestion and recommendation!
163,3,-i think that Cars 2 is an absoletly a good movie for every age to see and it is very funny so i think you should watch it with anyone
164,3,"-I was honestly dissapointed with the secod movie of the orignal cars. Cars the original was funny and a great family movie. But i was shocked at all the gun fights and killing of cars in this movie. And it wasnt as funny, enjoyable, and definetly not as kid friendly as the first.... Bottom line very dissapointing this movie should have a PG rateing!"
165,3,"-I took my 4 year old son to watch Cars 2 over the weekend. It was his first movie theater experience and we have been counting down the days for months for this movie to come out. Unfortunately, I was really disappointed by how much violence and inappropriate banter and language there was within the film. My son plugged his ears throughout various fighting scenes and was very aware that Lightning McQueen was trying to get killed in the movie. I am stunned that this movie is rated G. Honestly, if I had known there was so much violence in the film, I would have passed. Sadly, this feature is NOTHING like the first Cars. So disappointed."
166,3,"-You see, I think some parents are exaggerating about the violence although, there is a lot, my older sister and I were a little shocked when we found out some cars were actully killed!"
167,3,"-Honestly, we took our three year old to see this and it was not appropriate in the least.  In fact, my child tried to emulate the gun violence immediately when we got home......and this was a new behavior for him.  It's as if the movie explicitly taught him how to do it.....not that he wouldn't have learned it at some other point but little did I know he was learn it today!"
168,8,"-Cars 3 wasn't bad, but it definitely did not meet Pixar's high standards.  The script was weak, and there was nothing memorable, at all.  It will entertain your kids however, and there is never a dull moment.  There is zero bad language and no violence.  But Cars 3 is flat-out disappointment."
169,8,"-I loved this movie.  I think it is the of the three ""Cars"" series. I like this film the best because this isn't the average Disney & Pixar movie. This is a movie for the whole family. To prove it, my brother is two and he sat through this whole movie and he loved it. I like how now Lightning McQueen is getting older. As I was watching, I felt like the little kid again watching the first ""Cars"" movie. This fun family comedy is about new and improved race cars and they get faster than one of my all time favorite characters, Lightning McQueen. Lightning gets into a crash. This leads Lightning McQueen to get a trainer. This leads to trouble. I was surprised this film was so good  (considering how bad the second movie, ""Cars 2"" was).  The reason I think this film is OK for kids six and up is because there are some intense crashes and Lightning McQueen said "" Life's a beach"". Overall I recommend this movie to any family or any car loving kid."
170,8,"-Wow cars 3 is actually a good film. It's better than cars 2 which wasn't good in my opinion. This movie is perfect for kids 4 and up. There's no bad language or name calling.""life's is a beach and then you drive "" is said by lightning though lol! Young  Kids won't get it. "
171,8,-I think Cars 3 is an awesome. It teaches kids to believe in yourself and that males and females are equal. I recommend this movie for kids 7 and up and it's a must see for fans of the Cars franchise.
172,8,-It was a great story the new car Storm and the great old Litning McQueen
173,8,"-For the third movie of this so-far-trilogy, this was great! In my opinion, there's nothing much to be cautious about except for the devistating and dramatic crash in "
174,8,"-I understand this movie was  made to show girls they can do whatever they want to , my self as a girl who dreams of racing this movie honestly made me cry for an hour straight. It was so heart touching and amazing  but the ending broke me into pieces ; end of a day it's a kids movie you expect a happy for lightning to win and all the glory to be his , but no"
175,8,-I loved the movie but I have one issue. No kachow was said and I'm not impressed at all.
176,8,"-This movie was absolutely fantastic! It kept you on the edge of your seat all while having comical relief too. It maintained the storyline very well. The only thing I didn't like about it was the ending... When you wait all that time to see lighting McQueen race and win the race, and then he doesn't even finish the race, it's REALLY disappointing. I believe that he should've finished that race, and then gone into being the crew chief. Cars was the first movie I ever watched as a kid, and this movie really broke my heart! It crushed all the life out of me."
177,8,-The first of the Daniel Craig bond series is no doubt the best one as well. This film is about James Bond who has recently been promoted to 007  status has been sent on a mission to stop a terrorist organisation from getting 100s of millions of pounds. I rated this film 13+ because it has lots of graphic violence dark themes and a shocking torture scene. It also has a sex scene where nothing is shown but it has lots of kissing.
178,8,"-Good movie, awesome figt scene, really talented actors, would recommend for kids 13 and up."
179,8,"-It’s a good film, but there’s lots of violence and sex.  The card game is thrilling and action scenes are great.  Wait till you kids get older, but they HAVE TO see this film"
180,8,"-A classic bond film with several heart stopping moments and there are several moments that leave you asking ""How did he do this?"" out of great acting and an even better plot line. With a few twists and turns on the way this film will not let you dont. It met all expectations."
181,8,"-This is my personal favorite movie. Honestly, it is the closest to a perfect film I have ever seen. "
182,8,-jeepers i have never seen a film so violent. there is a torture scene that is so brutal. there are so many violent scenes like bond throwing people down stairs killing eachother in very brutal ways.
183,8,-It is a good film but has more violence than the other Daniel Craig films. A man gets drowned in a sink. James Bond gets tortured in a torture chamber. There is a fight on a stair case with knifes. There is a 2 minute scene of Bond strangling a man on the floor. Plenty of blood and gore. Lots of gunshots and stabbing. Some bad language and lots of sexual scenes. When bond kisses a girl topless for about three minutes and kisses more then this is the most sexual one by far. Also a Lady gets drowned in a cage.
184,8,"-This is my absolute favorite film in the James Bond franchise, and in general. The plot line is unparalleled, and extraordinarily intriguing. I would highly recommend watching, it is truly a fantastic film."
185,8,-An ok bond movie
186,8,-Language 3.5/10 - Violence 8/10 - Sex Content 5/10
187,8,"-Casino Royale is my all time favorite James Bond movie, and I've seen all 26! This movie follows the book by Ian Flemming much more closely than the original movie. Plus, Daniel Craig is absolutely amazing."
188,8,"-My rating:PG-13 for violence,sexuality/nudity,torture and drug use"
189,8,-I saw this with my sisters and it was amazing. I'm a die hard bond fan. I loved every minute of it! My favorite character was Vesper Lynd. I think it's a great movie for all famlies.
190,8,"-I know. This is a James Bond movie; many people around here are not allowed to see them, but surprisingly, Martin Campbell does one heck of a rare thrilling job. A ton better than Skyfall, it moves the James Bond genre to something like a Superhero movies while still keeping physics in mind. "
191,8,"-This movie was good, but there was not enough action and even I (12  years old)  didn't even understand this movie.  A kid who is under 12-13 years old shouldn't see this movie. It's hard to understand the concept of this movie. The rule James Bond had was to trust no one! There is also blood dripping down Bonds face and strong body."
192,8,"-This was one of the first Bond movies I saw, and I loved it. Having that said, keep in mind that we are talking about a James Bond movie; this meaning that there are scenes of nudity, violence, drugs, gambling and foul language. This movie is most certainly not suitable for children under 12."
193,8,"-My rating:R for graphic violence,graphic racy content,and brief strong language."
194,8,"-This movie has a good bit of violence, blood and gore."
195,8,"-This is one of the best movies E.V.E.R! This is oddly smiliar to a movie by matt damon called the martian where he is stranded on mars, if your child has watched the martian (which has way more language and violence) then this movie should be fine."
196,8,"-Meh. It’s ok. I mean, it wasn’t awful, but it wasn’t that great either. I had to close my eyes at a lot of moments in the movie, and I love the movies The Hunger Games, World War Z, Cloverfield, and War of the Worlds. CSM was right about it being “emotionally intense” It was kind of disappointing. But I guess it’s an option if you’re bored."
197,8,"-In many scenes, there is violence, and it is very emotional. He does change throughout the course of the film, though, which is good. He learns how to strive for his own life. In one scene, he takes his tooth out with a figure skate and a rock, which may be unsettling. Same as when a person is found dead just beneath the surface of the water."
198,8,"-I loved this movie, it has a great story and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. I chose aged 13 and up purely on the fact that that it wasn't scary but there is slightly graphic images of injuries and also a disturbing scene with a floating dead body which had a pale white face."
199,8,-Hahaha its good
200,8,"-This is one of my all time favorite movies, but it is hard to watch and very emotional. It get's very sad, and may be too much for little kids to take."
201,8,"-Cast Away makes you really feel how it would be to survive on a dessert island.  Though the main character, Chuck Nolan says ""God D**t S**t Hole"" talking about the island he is trapped on. Overall, this is a great movie to anyone who is mature enough to understand it."
202,8,-Before he gets on the island he's in a plane and it crashes. That part may be scary for some people because there is some blood and a violent death. But i liked his relationship with his volleyball Wilson. One of the sadest parts in the movie is when they get separated.
203,8,"-I had seen the movie a couple times previous but recently showed it to my younger sisters (4 and 6) who absolutely loved it! There is some violence including a scene where the male lead, Pazu, gets pistol-whipped but I wouldn't say it was enough to steer you off the movie. The younger of the two had a bit of an issue when they were having difficulties saving Sheeta but, again, It wasn't that big of a deal. And after assuring her that the girl would be ok, she calmed down. Both the male and female leads are strong and have great character development, especially Sheeta who learns to have faith in herself and her strength which I think is a great message for kids to learn."
204,8,"-I watched this last night with my 6 year old sister and she was a bit frightened in the battle scenes but she was fine after that. This has been my favourite film since I was 8. I cried half the way through not because it was sad but because it is so well written. If your kids aren't scared by a bit of violence, then this is perfect to introduce them to studio Ghilbi"
205,8,"-If you're looking for an excuse to get (back?) into watching Studio Ghibli movies, search no further. "
206,8,-Castle in the Sky is the perfect international adventure film! It is very violent because one of the main character's almost gets shot and it's a 9 year old so please be aware of that and Studio Ghibil is the perfect way to introduce anime to kids and I love the movie please go watch it
207,8,"-I'm going to just say what concerned caregivers should know, as to not give anything away. This is a cute and wonderful movie. However it is violent, and you should know the kid you want to show it to. This movie can be suitable for much younger audiences than 8, but it does contain guns and explosions. No one dies or is injured, understand that the violence relates only to the weapons. So be sure that the kid can handle a little excitement."
208,8,"-Although I loved this movie, I think that it does take a while to get really good, but it is totally worth watching the whole 2 hour movie to see the ending. Also it's surpisingly really violent."
209,8,"-This movie is awesome! I almost have no words for it! My hole family and me,  watched it yesterday until 10 pm, and we all loved it! It’s an awesome movie, a great message, and roll model. The only thing there is is, guns and shooting, but it’s not really scary, my family watched it, and my brother watched it, and he’s 6. There is a tiny bit of violence, from the guns, but it’s a great animated movie."
210,8,"-a great, well formed movie for those wanting to start studio ghibli. good for families with positive messages for all. has little racial representation"
211,8,-I think the  movie was the best I have ever seen I loved all the battle scenes
212,8,-i think its a wonderfull movie i mean you can float in the sky with that necklesss i think its magical fun but aliitle of violence like when muska 
213,8,-The incidents in this movie are Coo-Coo! Do not see this movie!!!!
214,8,"-I thought that this film was very sweet and very bright to its source material with a couple of surprises of its own. The performances by the younger kids was just right, the direction was superb, the visuals were so mystical, and the storyline was just right to the classic book itself. The only criticism I have of this movie is that Johnny Depp's performance as Willy Wonka was not one of his best performances I have seen with him. He doesn't make a compelling and mysterious Willy Wonka, his character is mean-spirited, he looks like half Shirley Temple and half Carol Burnett, and he looks like a woman. Overall, I thought that this film was very exhilarating and true to its purpose and source material of the book and that it will entertain many people of any age. Kids and 8 year olds are meant to see this movie, if they are fans of the book and 1971 movie version, and even adults can see this movie as well for its imagination and fun purpose. Younger kids under 8 years old are probably not meant to see this movie for its quirky situations, action, and mild language."
215,8,"-There's no option for 'too much horror' but if there was that's what this would have. It's not actually scary, but for a 3 year old it's creepy. A boy is sucked up a tube and taken away, a girl turns blue and becomes a huge blueberry and is rolled away, a girl is pushed down a shoot to an incenerator, and a boy is shrunk to microscopic size. All the kids survive however. One use of retard is the worst language you'll hear, nothing else really. Just keep in mind it's a dark Tim Burton movie."
216,8,-alluring fun and sweet movie overtelling the classic tale. staring the outstanding Johnny Depp. a must watch for the whole family. eat chocolate and let yourself relax in a swirl of candy while watching Charlie and the chocolate factory
217,8,"-It might not surpass the original, but it was still great. The acting, well done!"
218,8,"-started to like it, got bored of it after the 8th time"
219,8,"-First time I watched this movie, I liked it but since I watched this movie so many times, it's not that great anymore."
220,8,-It is a really good movie! It has good educational value because it tells you not to be greedy. The actors do really good jobs ( I also really like Johnny Depp he is really funny! )
221,8,"-Great film for all the family. However, some scenes of moderate peril could be upsetting or distressing to younger children. Carries a very strong positive message that should be shared."
222,8,-good
223,8,"-Brutall treatments . I suggest kids watch, under 8, with an adult. This has some sex: couple kisses, and a-loving couple getting married. The step-mother is very cruel and it could offend young ones."
224,8,"-The film is great! It has all the original characters including Ella, the stepsisters, Drizella and Anastasia, Lady Tremaine (the stepmother) and Prince Kit. This version of the story is a lot more detailed than the original though. It shows Ella’s childhood plus the death of her parents which was pretty sad. The death of Ella’s Mom was especially sad because she fell ill and it showed the scene when she died :( Anyways, the movie is great especially if you grew up watching the original or always wanted more details. I recommend this as a great family film!"
225,8,"-I know a lot of you want a flashy entertaining movie, but something can be said for just a well done retelling. Its okay to change the plot slightly but I do not understand why so many movies ruin the morels of each story. This movie stays faithful to the morals and truth of Cinderella. This is a very well done movie. Excellent job."
226,8,"-This take on classic tale is told in many ways but this remake is something else. It’s beautiful,stunning,and it’s the type of movie that everyone can laugh,cry,and enjoy together"
227,8,-I think this movie is better than the original animated Cinderella film because it is much more exciting and has more depth even though it is scarier and more mature for younger kids. It's really entertaining and great for Disney fans.
228,8,"-Courageous and Kind Ella, whose parents had recently pass away, lived the life of a servant under the rule of her cruel step mother.  The heroine, now called Cinderella because of the cinder and ash she slept near, was played by Lily James.  The evil stepmother was played by Academy Award Winner Cate Blanchett, and the dashing and handsome prince was played by Richard Madden.  Cinderella, released in 2015 is a live adaptation of the Disney animated classic by acclaimed director Kenneth Branagh.  This fairy tale, based in a land far, far away with a gorgeous countryside and colorful characters, was a beautiful film to watch.  ."
229,8,"-Beautiful adaption of a timeless classic, perfect for your  little princes and princesses! 12, and this is one of my favourite movies! The dresses, made by Sandy Powell, could not be more gorgeous, and though this adaptation lacks the unforgettable musical score, from the 1950 original, you will still be stunned at what a beautiful, emotional movie Disney has made! Also not forgetting the cast that may appeal to older viewers, including Richard Madden AKA Robb Stark from Game of Thrones as Prince ""Kit"" Charming, Lily James AKA Lady Rose from Downton Abbey (which highly pleased my mother) as Cinderella, Cate Blanchett AKA Elizabeth from the movie of the same name as Lady Tremaine/the stepmother, and Helena Bonham Carter AKA Bellatrix from Harry Potter as Fairy Godmother! You NEED to see this movie, as it is one of the most beautiful films ever made for kids and adults! I give Cinderella 5/5 stars, and say it's ok for kids ages 5+."
230,8,"-I feel like this adaptation didn't live up to the original movie at all. I felt like it was all too dramatic in the end. Sure, I'd watch it with someone else if they wanted me too, but never alone. Not that it's scary, I just don't like that they felt the need to make this more dark. If your kids are expecting the light-hearted cheer that the cartoon had, skip this one."
231,8,"-Okay movie, but too much like the old fairy tale.  Not very exciting.  The main characters were too perfect; they were always doing only the right thing and being too nice."
232,8,-It had really good actors but it was boring because you already know the plot and everything it practically had nothing scary there isnt much to say about it
233,8,-It was a waste of money to make such a movie. Bad actors that cannot cry or even pretend to be sad. A big disappointment. Children need new stories and not Cinderella #100
234,8,-Love everything in the movie!!!!!!! Nothing wrong with the movie!
235,8,-This movie made me cry. Best Movie Ever!
236,8,"-I loved this film. I'm a Disney freak and seeing Cinderella come to life in a live-action movie excited me, so say the least.  I was a little put off by the new portrayal of the fairy godmother, but otherwise I was oohing and aahing over that beautiful dress. Lady Tremaine was brillant too!"
237,8,"-A magical, stunning, beautiful, gorgeous looking retelling of a great fairy tale. Lily James and Richard Madden were excellent as the titular characters. Cate Blanchett was excellent as well. Kids will love it. Grade: A"
238,8,"-Like the original story, Cinderella plays out slowly with less romance than you want. But compared to Maleficent, this film was a pretty decent remake. It had well casted actors and beautiful scenery. However, young girls may feel intimidated by Cinderella's personality.  Talk with your kids about how girls should stand up for themselves. Also, the actress playing Cinderella is very skinny. I would not recommend this film to very young girls."
239,8,-Not for kids 15 & under
240,8,-Great movie! All ages! Loved it!
241,8,-My rating;G
242,7,-This is not for 10 year olds!
243,7,-The title makes me laughing! XD This movie is trash and racist!
244,8,-There is some language. Just a little of d word and h word. But no doubt one of the best messages and amazing role models. His friend was drinking a little but he later was sorry. If you have kids that like sports but all of the good ones are inappropriate this one is great! A great movie.
245,8,-Amazing movie for boys who like football
246,8,-Awesome movie about hope and the passion of one football player. It is just great.
247,8,-My rating:PG-13 violence and drinking.
248,8,"-This is by far my favourite movie ever, have a t shirt and everything of it, their is brief flirting between Atta and Flick, but will be overlooked by most children viewers, the film has some briefly frightening scenes, but overall, it’s a Pixar classic,(puts antz where it should be, at the bottom)"
249,8,"-Since Pixar was still testing out the CGI technology, after their first movie about plastic smooth toys, they made a movie about exoskeleton-clad smooth bugs. It may be lesser-known than Toy Story, but it is as good. It has the same message as Antz, but it is better in every way. While Antz was very brown, this is very colorful. While the Antz characters fall into the uncanny valley, this has ""cute"" characters. While all the Antz characters look the same, the circus bugs in this movie are very different from each other. While the Antz story is slow, this one is almost as tightly paced as Toy Story or the Lego Movie (though ABL drags in the middle a bit). While Antz is GORY, A Bug's Life just has mild peril. The story involves an ant colony, which does the stuff ants do. Collect food, carry it back to storage, that stuff. Children who watch this will learn about what ants do. There is one ant (forgot his name) who wants to stand out, but ends up accidentally ruining the other ants' work. Then there is a grasshopper colony who steals the food the ants collect. The ants have all just accepted that the grasshoppers take their food, but the aforementioned one ant wants to get the grasshoppers to go away, and runs off to recruit warrior bugs. That is just the almost-spoiler-free version of the first 30 to 45 minutes. The circus bugs the ant finds are very different from one another. But they all have likeable traits and are funny and charming to watch. There's the ladybug, the caterpillar, the stick bug, and others. They are circus performers, not warriors, but end up having the stuff to help save the day anyway. The grasshoppers are ""love to hate"" villains. The storyline gets slow at times, like during part of the middle stretch, but it's not a snooze like Antz's slow plot. Overall, Pixar's lesser-known second movie is a treat nearly as good as their first, but sadly more overlooked. One last note: There is a slightly morbid image made by the child ants in the movie that depicts the circus bugs dead and gory, with humorous comments from the awkward-feeling adults."
250,8,-[7.1X] | [G] (7+)
251,8,-A Bug's Life may not be the best of Pixar but it is still great. It has some memorable laughs and great characters. I would recommend this to ages 16 and older because there is lots of violence and language.
252,8,-It was not that good. I started the first 5 minutes and did not like it. I don't recommend it for you!
253,8,"-there is too much ant sex for me I mean geez have you seen the lady bug abomination thing? The main ant thing is too stupid for me, waste of time."
254,8,"-This movie has good role models such as Flik the ant. While watching this movie I notice something wrong with the ants, they only have 4 legs, and being an insect they should have 6 legs not 4, I fear that this might not teach younger children the proper appearance of an ant."
255,8,-On par with Cars as the most underappreciated Pixar movie
256,8,"-It's a very good movie, but some kids won't really enjoy it. And it has some swearing that are mean to one ant, named Flick"
257,8,-My rating:G
258,8,"-I've been a Judy Garland fan since lockdown. This is about a woman Esther Hoffman Howard / Esther Blodgett who is a singer and works for a drunk producer Norman Maine. She changes her stage name to Vicki Lester. I would say that it's got a lot of violence, a tiny touch of sex and some drinking."
259,7,"-Funny, heartwarming adventure has some peril and scares."
260,7,"-This film features AAPI role models and is a perfect choice for family movie night. Though there is a little peril, the great messages are strong throughout the entire film teaching kids to respect those who are different from them."
261,7,-This movie is great movie and the music is great. I also think the animation are also really good and it was also pretty funny at parts and the elemental powers are so cool.  I really like the part where they are flying on clouds. I think anyone would like this
262,7,-the movie was amazing for kids but was a bit stupid
263,7,-Good family movie for 6+. some of the characters are a bit mean/cruel so probably not best for children under 5 or 6.
264,7,-This is one of da bess films from DreamWorks!
265,7,"-Abominable is a great, interesting, and funny movie! My whole family loved it and the scenery is breath-taking. There is, however, a little bit of violence but that shouldn't stop you from watching it!"
266,7,"-This movie is AWESOME!! I think this movie has a lot of teamwork and other stuff that makes it like the best movie in the world,but some of this movie is scary.and there are two very funny parts in this movie."
267,8,"-I was watching this movie with my family a couple weeks ago and just won my school spelling bee prior to writing this review. This movie and its protagonist were very encouraging and made me feel very good about myself and  what I can do. This movie was highly enjoyable for me and my family. This movie teaches and grows many important skills and strengths to have in life, such as perseverance, kindness, practice, friendly but intense competition, sticking to anything you committed yourself to, and more. This movie gets very intense towards the end and is the kind of intensity you won’t take your eyes off the screen for until you find out what happens. I’m not telling you what the twist is, but all the characters are positive in a way and learn so much on their journey of preparing for spelling bees. Not every character is encouraging at first,  though all grow in some way throughout the duration of the film. It’s hard to create a movie that is this good and intense, but still teaches so many good things to viewers without making the film so childish. My congratulations to Hollywood. I hope to watch this family friends perfect movie more than once in my life. Very appropriate,too. Plus educational value."
268,8,"-This is a great family movie for all kids to enjoy. Exciting movie about determination, and hard work"
269,8,-This movie is very good! I think that this is a really good movie for the family. One thing to be aware of is that there is some mild language but other than that it's perfectly fine for kids 8 and up.
270,8,"-I think that it is really inspiring because Akeelah comes from a poor school that cant even afford bathroom stall doors. Also, she gets a great coach which she has a lot in common with, like they both lost someone important to them. Akeelah meets this boy Javier who helps her through the bee. Finally,  I was really worried and it  almost made me cry out of happiness at the end."
271,8,-This movie is absolutely great for the whole family. There is some references to death but otherwise it is fine. Also the mum/mom and Akeelah argue but the spelling parts of it are good.
272,8,"-This movie tells of a young girl from south Los Angeles going to a ghetto school and wining the national state spelling bee. expect ghetto talk ain't, dissing, dawg, yo, whassup, and more. there is also lots of cursing including S**t, D**n, A**, Hell, bull S**t, B*tch, and one mumbled mother F*cker. there is also references to weed, cocaine, and opium. there is also talk about sexually harassing people and to having sex there is also cheek kisses but no mouthed ones. kids are heard disrespecting teachers behind their backs too. and in one scene two ghetto girls confront Akeelah for being a braniac and a smart A** B*tch. the girls are seen pulling on Akeelah hair and hurting her. this move still tells how to be a good person and to learn who you are. I rate this"
273,8,"-Akeelah and the Bee has many positive messages and positive role models. This amazing movie contains very  mild language, but other than that, it is a spectacular film."
274,8,"-Thanks to Common Sense, I learned about this movie, among others and I loved it. It is a movie for everyone on the family. Great film!"
275,8,-best movie! i learned how to write prestidigitation.
276,8,-Great but kinda scary. I like it now being 9 but when I was 8 it was very intense and violent. Now I think otherwise. It is sweet still intense but overall good
277,8,-The gini is very nice he is my favorite character in aladdin and on his 3rd wish he set the gini free
278,8,"-I really loved this movie. Some things I liked was Jasmine's character, although many people have already said that. I also appreciated the fact that although Aladdin was a thief, he was more kindhearted from it. He only stole from those who he thought could provide for themselves good and those who were not kind to others. (Not that stealing is good, but a thief is part of his situation to live, and I thought that this movie highlighted that). He got in trouble with the guards not because he stole something, but was helping Jasmine not get caught. There was a lot of humor in this, and I found myself laughing at many parts. I thought acting was really good and actors were well picked out. (Nobody can beat Robin Williams, but Will Smith does really good at following him). "
279,8,"-I really enjoyed watching this movie with my friends. They love it to. Jasmine is a great role model showing that girls can be great leaders and that their voice matters. It can be a little scary at times for younger kids. But overall, I give it a 5 out of 5 stars. Great Movie :D."
280,8,-Really loved the music in this movie. Funny and inspirational!
281,8,"-Keeping in mind I have not watched the original yet, I think this film is WONDERFUL. Great songs include 'Friend like me', 'A whole new world' and 'Speechless', all of which have a very powerful message. Will Smith's performance as Genie was so funny. However, there was lots of scariness, especially in the final half, mainly to do with Jafar. Another good thing is the huge amount of special effects. Overall great film."
282,8,"-ALADDIN (2019) contains mild flirting, and violence. Parents should know about the scariness."
283,8,"-This is a stunning and breathtaking adaption of the animated film. It includes some kissing and iffy remarks, some peril, but otherwise this movie is a must-see for all ages!"
284,8,-just violent
285,8,-https://www.commonsensemedia.org/users/doggodess
286,8,-This movie was full off nightmarish images and a lot of analogies for drugs. It was terrifying and creepy. Literally my worst nightmare. This should be classified as a horror movie. DO NOT WATCH THIS!
287,8,"-Well this movie was... SUPER VIOLENT, like very violent! I'm 11 and I had to look away at the gorey parts. I could handle it but I wish it was a little less scary. I think most 11 year olds can handle it but its going to be more enjoyable to a teen. There was also some uncomfortable parts with kissing and other romamce. It was magical and sometimes even funny but the creepy parts overrided the cool parts. Maybe if I was a teen I could explain the good parts more but it just was ""eek!"" for me. Recommended for teens but not for kids! Hope this was helpful!"
288,8,"-First of all, I love nearly every Burton movie I’ve seen. I never really liked Alice in Wonderland, but I was excited to see Burton’s genius transmitted to the fantasy world of Wonderland."
289,8,"-I grew up with this live action Alice and find it potentially the most aesthetic film I’ve ever seen. The story’s a little wonky but I love the acting and general style. Not very violent but an animal’s eye is chopped out and another’s head is chopped off. I watch it mostly for the style, but at its heart, it’s my dearest Alice."
290,8,"-This is an awesome movie, but its very creepy. Lots of fighting, heads getting chopped off, ect. They could've just kept a playful fairy tale good, then make it into this weird creepy stuff. It also might frighten younger kids, with violence. I guess watching it one time is fine, but after one time, I'm good. Not going to watch this again."
291,8,-Alice is a good role model but the movie in general is just kind of boring. Some things may scare little kids. I liked Alice through the looking glass so much better
292,8,"-Well, don’t get me wrong, the classic version is amazing! But so is this! I’m not usually a fan of Tim Burton’s but I loved this movie! Such a great twist but probably not for the younger age as it does have a bit of violence. But I loved it and I understand how people don’t, but in my opinion I think it’s awesome."
293,8,"-This movie totally ruined the story of Alice in wonderland for me. In this version, Alice is too dull and isn’t excited and curious like in the book or in the Disney movie. I just didn’t like it. Plus Alice was supposed to be a little girl, not a 20 year old or whatever!"
294,8,"-the Disney classic is one of my favorite movies, so I was really exited to see this one. but once I watched it I was really surprised how it wasn't even a remake. it was an adaptive sequel.the jabberwocky is also TERRIFYING. this film should definitely not be viewed by anyone 13."
508,6,-The best!
509,6,-This movie was really good. It’s probably one of my favorite marvel movies. I recommend this movie.
510,6,"-So good, it made me cry"
511,6,-I remember watching this back in late 2017 to early 2018.
512,6,"-If you still have encanto fever, try watching this. it might be fine for a mature 6 year old but i recommend 7+ pretty much- the reason why is because younger kids 4 to 6 years old may be scared of some things like the images and death, it also has murder from posion, and murder from pushing off heights, (non-graphic, no blood and no injurys shown for both, the boy who was pushed also was saved before he hit the ground) in it, skeletons, ect. mild crude humor that kids may not get but it has pretty good representation as it has tons of mexican culture"
513,6,-I don’t mind this movie but I did find it quite boring. The storyline was great though. I don’t understand why people find this scary but it really isn’t and I feel they are just being dramatic.
514,6,-Beautiful. Great representation of Mexican culture and so much time and effort put into the art. I love it and am having so much trouble why some people think it's scary because of skeletons.
515,8,"-My sister had first showed me this film when I was 7, I was terrified and it caused my phobia of buttons to increase and get worse by a lot. It is a creepy film and I personally don't recommend anyone under 10 to watch it. It has a dark storyline and I didn't enjoy it. I appreciate that not everyone has a phobia of buttons, but I still believe anyone under 10 should definitely beware."
516,8,"-My brother saw this alone at night when he was 6, and it terrified him. I saw it when I was 7 and,  I thought it was scary, but not too much. Me and my brother each love the movie. The stop animation effect is great, and it's always exciting!! We watch it together all the time now, and we still love it. I think that you can see it when you are 7, but it will still be pretty scary."
517,8,-Good for ages * and up but has some moments were might scae young children
518,8,"-Coraline is kind of like a horror film for younger children. I was around 7 when I first watched Coraline and I was kind of scared at the time however watchiing a 'horror film' made me feel cool and grownup which is one of the reasons I think that kids enjoy it. There's many scary scenes in the film but nothing that is extremely disturbing. A woman in the film tries to persuade a young girl to sew button into her eyes which is incredibly creepy. The part that scared me the most, and still does now sometimes, is the end when a girl is being chased  by this spider like human (I'm not trying to go into detail because of spoilers).  A part that may make parents feel slightly uncomfortable is a scene where  two old women are almost naked (its for comedy not anything sexual) while they are on a trapeze. f you're children are sensitive and are not used to violence and disturbing content then this is not the best thing to show them."
519,8,"-I think this movie is fine for 10 year olds and up. I watched it at the age I am now, 9, in 2017, and it gave me a good scare, but I think 1982's Poltergeist is way creepier than this. This film does have a killer mom than wants to sew buttons into Coraline's eyes, but, if you've watched the Goosebumps movie, The Haunting Hour TV show and Beetlejuice, then you're definitely fine with this. By the way, I slept in my bedroom on my own with only two lights on, and I didn't have any nightmares."
520,8,"-Well, it's all about a monster who lures children away from their parents and tricks them into having buttons sewn into their eyes, so it definitely deserves a pg-13 rating, but other than that it's a really good movie about how you really never appreciate something enough until it's gone. it is dark and disturbing and the animation somehow makes it a lot scarier"
521,8,"-Okay, I'm kind of a freak and have always been kind of abnormal, but I freaking loved this movie when I was 5. Yeah, it's creepy, but that's what makes it fun, and it certainly will challenge a kid more than squeaky-clean trash we shove down the throats of our fellow young 'uns. Though, if your kid is a little wuss-I mean is more sensitive, take some precautions and watch some clips first. And about the naked woman pasties part:Grow up. No kid thinks it's a big deal, it's a joke, and it's a suit. Not to mention the naked body is everywhere, at home, in art, etc, so is it that big of a problem?"
522,8,"-Good film, well animated. But scary for younger audiences. Not for sensitive children, parents should watch first to be certain. "
523,8,"-In this movie, the parents do not help or care about the child. This might make a child think that it is common and feel scared that this might happen to them.  I watched this at school, sadly. My teacher gave this movie to watch and my mom would have never approved such movie. I do not see that there are important lessons or even a role model that a child like me should look up to. Another disturbing part was the button eyes. I think it is very frightening for a child to see instead of eyes buttons. My friend had nightmares after watched the movie."
524,8,"-To be honest, I don't know why this movie was a PG. Even I found this scary, and i hardly find ANYTHING scary. It is such a horrible idea. People with button eyes? That's bad enough. Your parents with button eyes. WOW. "
525,7,-It was very creepy and the actors were not very good. Some parts were funny like those two crazy lady but others were creepy or boring.
526,7,"-Coraline is a great movie. Although it may look like a kid friendly movie I'm warning you it's not what it seems. The movie is not only scary but actually very creepy. Showing people with button eyes can scare young kids. Some scenes are dark and creepy and will scare children. I recommend this movie for kids between ages 9 and 15. Great movie though, very enjoyable."
527,7,"-The first time I watched this movie, was when I was five. This is my most favorite movie ever!!!! I am very into creepy, dark, and horror-ish movies, tv series, and books, it's just what I like. This movie is fun and interesting and creepy. It also has some great messages and role models. The main character shows us that you should be curious to a limit, but you should still explore. The other main character shoes us to never give up and that you should always stick by your friends. This is an amazing movie in my opinion, but if you are really sensitive and young then it would be ,probably ,better for them not to watch it. I hope you found my review helpfull. By the way I am 12 years old."
528,7,"-Coraline was a movie i was thoroughly dissapointed with. It was horrible and i would never tell anyone to watch it AND if they said they were going too i would tell them not too simply cause of the crappy stop motion, lackluster plot and ridiculous trops that it presents definitally not worth the time."
529,7,"-This movie is definetely one of my favorites. The reviews saying that this should be for ages 13+ 14+ and especially 17+ are RIDICULOUS. I watched this movie when I was about 8 or 9 and have loved it ever sense. Maybe that's because I grew up watching horror movies and am a big strange myself. It didn't creep me out at all. If your child is anxious or very emotional, maybe hold off until they're 11. But if not, really any age over 7 is good.  I also think coraline is quite a role model. For a 12 year old, she is very independent, creative and ambitious. yes she has attitude towards her parents. but that is pretty normal."
530,7,"-5 Year old's don't understand the TRUE story to what's going on. I first watched this when I was 6 and all I could figure out was that there was an evil lady who was trying to take coraline. Now I'm older I've realized there is much more to it then that, but the clues are subtle. It's a very good movie, great for little kids who are into creepy things but you don't want to show them saw or something. There is no swearing in this film unless you count the cra P word to be one but its highly un noticable."
531,7,"-This movie has a great message to be happy with what you have, but otherwise, throw this movie inside your garbage bag. I watched this and I stayed up late cause I couldn't get to sleep. In this movie, the Other Mother takes Coraline`s parents at the end, shows gross bugs, and is just plain scary and weird. The Other Mother later turns into a hideous monster who wants to put doll eyes on Coraline. Only reason I gave it 2 stars is cause of the great stop motion animation."
532,7,"-I'm 14. I saw this movie when I was 7. I loved it! I watched it many times and learned a lot from it. Although I was creeped out, I have always been a fan of horror, even when I was little, and it didnt keep me up at night. If your kid is into ghosts or zombies, and you think that they can handle some mature themes (like dead kids, absent parents etc.) it's a great movie. It's messed up, but great. My brother on the other hand, who was 9 when he saw it, couldn't sleep. He's never been a horror person and although it didn't freak him out for more than a few days, he should've waited to see it. Evaluate whether or not your kid is a fit for the movie, it's worth watching if they are, and you as an adult should watch it too! One of my favorite animated movies."
533,7,-I saw this movie when I was about 6 and I was so scared and I ran out of the theater and was crying because I was so scared and then my mom made me go back in and I'm glad she did because it was funny and scary.
534,7,-This movie is very creepy if you read the book.
535,8,"-its a great movie with lots of cool effects the lady with the big boobies (mrs forcible) WAS JUST WEARING A ZIPPER COSTUME you know, like a barney costume.."
536,8,"-i loved this movie I saw it when I was nine and I read the book and memorized every line from the movie my parents thought I was insane but oh well. I think this movie gave me a positive message saying ""things aren't always as good as they may seem"" or ""be careful what you wish for"". I dont think its really for kids though because some scenes are a bit scary and could possibly scar young children."
537,8,"-I love this movie! It captures your attention from the beginning all the way until the end. The moral of this movie is explained by the movies slogan ""be careful what you wish for"". Coraline discovers that the grass is not always greener on the other side. In this movie Coraline feels unloved and neglected by her parents, neighbors, and friend Wybie. She soon finds a little door that is bricked up. However later that night a mouse leads her to that door and a strange portal or tunnel opens up that leads to a replica of the house only everything is better. It seems as though everything is a dream come true until the ""other mother"" trys to keep her there forever. Coraline quickly discorvs the truth about the world she thought was paridice and quickly tries to escape from the ""spiders web"". "
538,8,"-It's supermelonkitty204 with your top reviews. Though ""Coraline"" might seem like a calm movie, the whole film has a very creepy vibe. The story is about a young girl moving to an old apartment building in a quiet and mysterious little town. Coraline, the main character, travels to another dimension through a secret door in her home every night. The land is filled with succulent treats and whimsical characters. She is involved in somewhat strange activities. After several visits, her ""other"" parents (the ones from the other world) want to sow buttons in her eyes but she refuses. When she rebels, the so called ""wondrous land"" turns into a dark ruin full of hatred. Her parents are trapped and she must escape while freeing them. This strange, creepy, and might I say derranged movie is a stop for kids 9 and younger."
539,8,"-Which is better: A movie about a girl with magical powers ( bloody violence included ), OR a movie about creepy people that want to sew buttons into the girls EYES then KILL her? RATED R CARRIE SEEMS BETTER!"
540,8,"-Be warned, went I saw this when I was 8, I was freaked out of my freakin mind. It creeps me out to this day......."
541,8,-Agegroups: 14+
542,8,"-I watched this when I was around nine, and I freaked out. I turned it off halfway through when Coraline's real parents were gone. It was disturbing and scary to me, but I get freaked out easily. I wouldn't recommend it for kids below 7 though, and it's iffy for 8-9. If she/he is frightened easily, then I wouldn't suggest this."
543,8,"-I myself think is an AMAZING movie. but I think it is not made for all children, like for ezanple my sister. when she saw the movie she was so frittened that she cried like 5 times during the movie, she even had to stay out of the theather!!! but of course she is scared of certain things. but my brother is littler than my sister and he loved it. this is a movie I would say is for kids who are brave and enjoy's a llitle scare or two. it's a movie that's exiting, triling, mystirius and obove all scary fun. but ofcourse I am just a fan, so my thoughts may be different than yours. I hope this was a help."
544,8,-its just a little scary because of the fake mother and the trapping but over-all it was really good
545,8,"-Don't get me wrong amazing movie but, THE SECOND ONE IS SO MUCH BETTER!!!!!!!!!!"
546,8,-not allowed for kids under 13
547,8,-I'm totally obsessed with the concept of this movie even as a teen.
548,8,"-First off, the movie is SOOO over hyped. Another thing is that the film for some reason it gives the impression that being a rebel is cool and it's good for people to be scared of you. The movies couple makes and Ben are so annoying, mal just stole Ben from some girl but they still end up together... the only thing I liked was the fact Evie learned that you don't need to play dumb for people to like you(which what Disney cjvannel shows in its tv shows)"
549,8,"-Enjoyable, with positive messages and unique characters, but parents must beware that themes such as child abuse, neglect, and the effects of living in a poverty stricken society are heavy throughout. At one point, two of the main characters discuss whether their parents love them, followed by confessions that they are scared of their parents and “what they will do to them” if they don’t do what they say. This is something that could start a conversation with your child, but as this is a main idea throughout and something that is reinforced explicitly with dialogue, I would recommend assessing the maturity of your child and exercising hesitation with kids under 10 years."
550,8,"-Ok... I  love ever after high! Like it was my favourite and when I realized they made descendants... SUCH A COPY! Now I have to admit, I was pretty excited, but when I watched it, it disappointed me. I mean it completely copied EAH. There is a bit of flirting and like love and stuff like that. At one part Mal does say things like, ""If your mom really loved you she'd do this"" and puts Jane down by saying things like ""Dont you want to be prettier."
551,8,"-This was a very big Disney hit. The movie is pretty good. Predictable but, good. Liked the actors and actresses."
552,8,-Amazing
553,8,-IT WAS NICE TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TOO DISNEY CHARACTER.S KIDS AND A NICE MUSICAL MOVIE 
554,8,-It is very well... meh
555,8,-My persomal MPAA rating
556,8,"-This movie is really good, and though there is a small amount of blood, it is mostly magical fighting. The main character gets in a car crash because of texting and loses use of his hands. The battle scenes are pretty intense though. I definitely recommend this movie. It is my 2nd favorite ever, my first being Ant-Man."
557,8,"-I just want to start of with the visuals. They are soooo good and you would thing it was real. For violence there are some medical operations( minimal blood except in one scene). Fights with energy type weapons and weird swords. The ancient one dies from a stab and falls out of a portal onto the streets( glass shattered). When the ancient one dies there are blood scrapes and scratches on her face( you cand hear the monitor beep). Doctor strange is shown dying over and over again( Impaled by crystal rocks, smashed with giant hand, energy beam, all without blood though). If you see it you can see someone on the ground with a blood pool around there head( they presumably live). Language such as shit, damn, hell, ass, and god( oh my god, or just god as a exclamation). Doctor strange and a fellow surgeon share a kiss. All in all a great addition to the MCU, but not my favorite."
558,8,"-If you decide violence is no object for your kids, you should be 100% fine with them seeing it. No sexual content, language is a little strong but not-so-recurring."
559,8,-violence 7/10
560,8,-I think this movie is good for ages nine and up but for kids who like action movies I'd say eight and up it's a really good movie I watch it again
561,8,"-I have seen other reviews that say doctor strange is bloody and gruesome but that is only when they show stuff in the hospital that strange works at. This movie is great but you shouldn’t let kids under seven watch it. It a had a bit of violence but not to much. There is a car crash at about the 15 minute mark and it is quite intense. There is a time loop at the end where strange gets killed like ten times but it is not disturbing, They only show how he’s going to get killed but never actually show him getting killed. There’s also a lot of destruction but that’s all."
562,7,-Good great positive messages and role models I would suggest it to family's kid friendly some insault comments but not terrible
563,7,"-Four year olds wouldn't get that the Whos lived on a speck. There is a scene with a vulture and a kangaroo. The vulture says,""Why don't you face Horton yourself?"" The kangaroo says,""I'm a lady"" So sexist! Otherwise, a great movie with great messages."
564,7,-This movie is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO boring. Never bring this movie into my sight again and if you do there will be consensuses. U have been warned.
565,7,"-Hugely funny, Likable voice actors, soothing graphics, this is an Ideal Cartoon. Although the physics is terrible, even for a cartoon :) ."
566,7,-Good dr sues movie
567,7,"-This was a fantastic  comedy  for everyone to enjoy. Then again, what a creepy  movie ! !!!!!!!!!"
568,7,"-This CGI adventure is clean for the most part and answers questions that readers have wondered for over 50 years: Did the Mayor have any sort of relationship with Jojo? Do the Whos know their city is a speck in space? Who were Horton's friends? Did Vlad feel remorse after the Whos made themselves known? It just goes on and on. They also added stuff to make it longer, like Horton's journey to bring the speck to safety or the existence of Morton or the ""good"" Vlad. Really fun story, really fun characters, and possibly the second film in movie history to exceed the book. (The first was The Incredibles.) The only bad part is when a malicious Senator calls the Mayor a ""babbling boob."""
569,7,-This is hilarious! Jim Carrey was funny in this.
570,7,-I KNOW YOU GUYS THINK IS A LITTLE KIDS MOVIE BUT WHEN I SEE IT WHEN I WAS 6 I FOUND THIS FINE AND A LITTLE SCARY
571,7,-Family can be so mean that's how the mother kangaroo is like and brothers can be mean to but there's no one like that in this movie
572,8,"-My friend told me that this movie sucked. I disagree. I really liked the cinematography and the story. The idea is pretty unique and what humor there was great. There were a lot of great actors in it, also. It was kinda violent, but the worst of it was a decapitation and the murderer carried the head for a bit. The most sexuality was the mention that the main character's mother was a concubine and not the wife if the father, and there are a couple scenes with naked men. There is nothing exposed. Overall, it was pretty good."
573,8,"-This was a wonderful movie and I totally recommend it! The actors were great and the scenery beautiful. The violence was not too graphic and if you are mature enough, you could definitely watch it at the age of 13."
574,8,-Love timothée chalamet and he does an amazing job playing paul! It stayed completly true to the book!!!! It was amazing!
575,8,"-Great story, effects, and soundtrack"
576,8,-Dune is a rich sci-fi universe that I enjoy a lot.  The director (the same as Blade Runner 2049) makes long shots of the actors to show emotion which might make impatient viewers go insane but I personally enjoyed it.  
577,8,"-I thought it was a great movie. However, it did feel a bit slow."
578,8,"-I have never read the book.I literally don't get how people can give this 5 stars and be serious about it. I watched this movie on HBO Max and I was expecting it to be entertaining. It wasn't that good at all. The fight scenes were dumb and look like a kid directed it. The story is ok. It's very confusing and incomplete. There are so many plot holes. I wanted to like it alot, but I can only like bits and pieces of it."
579,8,"-Compared to the awful 1954 movie, this movie is a huge step up in every way! This movie is definitely a must-see if you are a sci-fi fan, the movie has a lot of great characters and fantastic visual effects and action sequences."
580,8,-I’ll keep this short:
581,8,-But there was violence but apart from that it was great and I will give it a 10 +
582,8,"-Amazing! Me my mom and my daddy watched it on public television. It was really funny we love making fun of old movies and there is this one moment where this women is gifted a pug puppy and she hands it to the maid, and the maid makes such a disgusted face!😂"
583,8,"-I watched this movie it is just incredible, it doesn't involve any harmful, scary, violent, drug, drinking, smoking scenes and moments, some scenes may be a bit boring for younger children but it is subtitle for 6 and up"
584,7,-This movie is very funny and has messages about how you should always have a smile on your face and care about others.
585,7,"-This movie is down-right funny; there is plenty of laughs and it never gets old! This movie is one of the best Christmas ever made -- not only does it keep in rage with it's rating PG, it is actaully a bit pure/cleaner than most Christmas movies (well, the Polar Express is cleaner/purer than this movie). I think this movie is for everyone to see. Although, there is one suggestive moment with showering it is not too explicit/grpahic for young kids not to see. There is one upsetting scene where Buddy's dad yells at him to get out of his life. But overall, this movie delivers the fun and magic of Christmas and the true spirit of it! Infrequent mild language (crap, piss, etc.) is heard but don't be too worried about that!"
586,7,"-Ferrell's gross, heartwarming fish out of water holiday story is clever, has messages about differences, family, and belief, and has spectacular goofy acting."
587,7,"-This is SUCH a good film and it's great for families! There are some very positive messages in this film. There is some language like hell, d*mn, son of a nutcracker, up yours, and shut up. And some iffy stuff like in one scene, Buddy goes to a shopping mall and sees a red bra with white feathers on display and takes it and holds it up so he can see it, in other scene he hears a women singing which finds out to be the girl he likes and yet, she's singing in a shower naked ( nudity is not shown but bare shoulders and arms are ) There is also a bit of drinking. Buddy is as great role model because he is joyful and nice and has the Christmas spirit. This movie gets 5 stars and is intended for kids of the age nine and up!"
588,7,"-Elf is amazing! It teaches kids to love themselves no matter how different they may be and it teaches kids to value family over everything else! The worst it gets is a scene with some alcohol in it, but besides that it is cleaner than a germaphobes house!"
589,7,"-It’s a great movie, perfect for Christmas time! I watch it yearly and it never gets old. Not to mention it is very funny. The only reason I rated it 7+ is because children under 7 might not understand certain parts of it.  It also has a good message in it: to always remember the meaning of Christmas and to spread Christmas cheer whenever you can. The father in this movie is a very mean person at the beginning, and then changes for the good at the end. That is a good role model."
590,7,"-This is a funny, entertaining classic with good characters and writing. i'd recommend it for families looking for a fun Christmas movie. My suggested age rating would would be PG (parental guidance) for mild violence and some rude humour."
591,7,"-Elf is the story of Buddy the Elf,  a man who grows up making toys for Santa in the North Pole. He decides to take a trip to New York City to find his biological father, and has several misadventures upon his arrival. This movie is adorable, sweet, and funny, with a couple of iffy spots here and there.  It's probably best not to show this to kids who still believe in Santa Claus. Aside from that, there is a scene where Buddy innocently goes into the women's locker room so he can listen to the girl he likes singing in the shower, and a couple of fight scenes. Other than that, it's a great movie that your kids will probably love!"
592,7,"-I thought Elf was funny, It really shows the Christmas spirit."
593,8,"-A good plot formed movie, however, it is not that ""epic"" in my opinion."
594,8,"-Epic is a visually appealing movie but sadly has a derivative storyline. The Positives are The Voice acting (Believable acting and most of all, each actor fits the character that it portrays), the animation (Visually appealing, nicely designed and fittingly gorgeous), the music (it fits the movie and is at times on cue with the emotions at hand), the pace (very fast) and finally the messages (I liked how it showed that Relationships are important, never give up and always forgive). The Negatives are the derivative storyline (Pretty much steals Narrative ideas from Avatar, The Little’s and Honey I Shrunk the Kids), the lack of character development (Pretty much no characters are developed), typical bad guy (Nothing about him stands out as well as his background isn’t explored), clichéd father-daughter relationship, and finally the movie wasn’t epic (The title is epic and in No way was the movie actually that and was rather small in scope). I would not recommend this film."
595,8,-It has good messages as well as not nice swear words.
596,8,"-In my opinion it didn't quite reach the level of epic but it was good. The scenery was quite magnificent and creative with its majestic colours. Furthermore it was violent but nothing like gore and blood just sword fighting, very awesome. Also, there was funny scenes but mostly they involve with a slug, a very dashing and cool one. However I was disappointed of the way they put the moral out. The character kind of went a bit of track in the solution of defeating the evil and didn't give me a powerful message but a very weak one. All in all, the movie had colourful scenes and had a sense of humor but they didn't quite put the moral out very well as for the romance was a bit bad, I have to mention, and a boring time to time. That's my opinion though."
597,8,"-good, sometimes boring. i only liked ais ansari"
598,8,"-I'm 10 and this movie was pretty good. it might be a little to violent/scary for kids under 7. its not bloody or any thing intense, its little guys and the bad guys try to destory the forest. If i could chose the MPAA rating and reason, it would be: this film is rated PG for- Mild Action, and scary events for young kids"
599,8,-It's a really good movie and it doesn't have any rude parts.Some of the parts are really funny.Children you celebrities well will probably know Beyonce so kids will be crazy about it but tell the kids that she is only there for beginning part because after that she dies.
600,8,-Epic is a nice movie that can create a franchise once again for Blue Sky. It is a very different story and is a fun movie for kids. Bottom-Line: It is fun movie for kids as it has a different story.
601,8,-My sister (who is 4 years old) was very scared of the part of the movie that was about decay and mini-men in dead rat bodies but for me it was the best movie of 2013 because I love nature and archery and it has a lot of this in the movie.
602,8,"-My rating:PG-13 for racy content,and gory images."
603,8,"-I saw it in the theaters for my birthday present. When i saw it, I LOVED IT!!! I will tell you that this is one of the best animated drama movies of the year that it was made. For like twenty years or something, of all drama films this one is awarded for  APPROPRIATENESS FOR KIDS OF ALL AGES. I mean little kids with no taste of emotion would want to see it!!(Man! I'm talking like preschool.) I think Dory starring in place of Nemo would be something the kids would want to see. Plus the characters during Dory's search for her parents inspire the kids. So lay down on the couch, turn on the tv and watch some Finding Dory!"
604,8,"-This movie is very well appropriate for kids that love adventure. A good part that I saw was a funny part where the otters drove a van! Mildly scary, no violence at all. I recommend it!"
605,8,-I thought finding dory was a good and funny movie because dory can't find her family. she stayed with marlins family until she can find her family she thought her family was dead and final her family was alive.
606,8,"-It's supposed to be funny and cheery for little 5 and 6 year olds but honestly, I nearly cried at some bits AND I'M 11! But they did hide an obvious sexual joke at the start... 5 and 6 year olds definitely would not understand. Families; When your 5 or 6 year old asks about ""mummies and daddies"" and ""babies"" blame Pixar and Disney."
607,8,-I think that it is a great film with a great message about teamwork. there is no bad language and it isn't too sad.
608,8,-I find the content in the movie quite offensive. It is definitely not the Pixar I am used to.
609,8,-This movie has you laughing from the first scene to the last one. It is very humorous for kids and adults alike. My mom and I couldn't stop imitating Bailey once we walked out of the theater. The story is about young dory trying to find her parents and introduces a lot of good life skills to kids such as what to do if you encounter a whale shark. Excellent movie and family friendly!!!
610,8,"-I watched Finding Nemo when I was about 4 years old and loved it! When this came out 13 years later, it was well made. It had a different plot, new loving characters, plus some very emotional moments. Dory is a great role model because although she's forgetful, she never gives up on finding her family and always refers to her childhood to help her in sticky situations. Plus some other characters play great role models like Destiny, who always warns and helps Dory and her friends. The film also has great messages involving not giving up, and family and sticking together is important. Although there are a couple of scenes that may disturb young children such as when Dory gets separated or a giant squid chases Dory and her friends. Overall amazing made sequel and is a great choice for kids age 6 and up."
611,8,-On par with Finding Nemo
612,8,-it is a very very good sequel to finding memo  you have to watch finding memo to understand the movie
613,8,-Finding Nemo is a really good movie. It can teach children how aquatic animals interact with each other and what they look like. There is one scary scene that involves a menacing angler fish.
614,8,"-This movie is funny, not boring so it keeps moving. This movie has very little intense scenes. Bruce (the antagonist) the shark maybe a little scary for youngsters but I think that Dory and Nemo's dad handle it very well. This is a positive, well made family movie that is a classic still to this day."
615,8,-Loved this movie and it also taught me lots about the ocean.
616,8,"-Pixar has made a lot of amazing films, but this may just be just the best one yet.  Nemo, Dory, and Marlin are some of the best movie characters for children ever.  One thing for parents to understand, is that there is a lot of suspense and action throughout that may upset younger viewers.  6 sounds about right.  By the way, there's very little consumerism."
617,8,"-Finding Nemo is a pretty good movie, great messages,  it's a little educational showing all the ocean animals but not too much.  Has some scary parts like sharks wanting to eat the fish and at one point some bombs under water go off so some kids might be scared, also some moments where some beards try to eat the main characters and a lot of sad moments so I didn't like the movie too much because it was kind of sad a lot but I think a lot of other people would still like it."
618,8,"-Finding Nemo is a fun, family film but it's important to know that this film has some very dark moments. "
619,8,"-I Would Rate This 0 Stars If I Could. First Of All,  When Coral And All But One Baby Get Eaten By A Shark I Thought ""What? Why Can't Coral Just Have To Go Somewhere Else For Some Reason And Could Take All But One Baby?"". The Next Thing That's Wrong With It Is The Violence. I Mean, When Blood Is Shown, It Leads To A Near-Death Shark Attack. Also, Did They HAVE To Give Darla A Reputation For Killing Fish Beacause She Shakes The Bag Too Hard? Why Can't Nemo Just Not Want To Go With Her Beacause He Was Afraid He'd Never See His Father Again? Also, Does Nemo Have To Be Kidnapped In The First Place? Why Couldn't He Just Have Something Special Taken Away From Him? The Last Thing Is, It's Just Plain Old Boring, The Only Reason Why I've Seen It Twice Was To Try Out The Movie, Then I Had To Watch It Again Beacause I Was At Summer Camp. It's Just Plain Old Terrible. Don't Bother."
620,8,-Boring. Most of it is music and the music is not even good.
621,8,"-Loved it, quite emotional at some points though."
622,8,"-Even though the visuals were great, Olaf was at his prime, and Panic at the Disco's ""Into the Unknown"" is excellent, the story itself falls short. Also, there was too much focus on Elsa. The whole ""Elsa this"" and ""Elsa that"" was annoying. Anna should've been the fifth spirit."
623,8,"-This is totally child friendly. There are no bad words or anything inappropriate. There is a lot of singing, which kinda made it feel like there was not a main plot, but I like this movie, and my sisters watched this and they loved it. The characters are silly and creative. There are some intense parts but they’re not really intense but it may be to some really sensitive kids. There are two characters that are a couple which some parents may think that it is not for younger kids and it kinda just depends."
624,8,"-Frozen is a good movie in my opinion. It's good at showing the relationship of two sisters, it's story is standard for a Disney princess movie but, it is a good modern interpretation. Frozen 2 is not anywhere near the first. The less focus on characters makes the amazing cast feel seperated. Every B story has almost nothing to do with the final plot points, and could be summarized in a sentence. I think some of the stuff with the forest people and Arendelle is good but, it's few and far between."
625,8,-So this movie has much better quality and the animations are a lot better. The songs are catchy and the plot is really awesome. My jaw dropped a lot when I saw this in theaters a year ago.
626,8,"-I really liked it better than the first movie(Frozen wasn't really as much of a story) OK, i gave it 4 stars because it was slightly scary. (I have a fear of movies, there are only 3 movies i like including this) So NEVER take a little kid because I'm 100% sure that they'll be scared unless you have a 1-in-a billon sibling  who is REALLY,REALLY brave."
627,6,-I WOULD DEFINITELY SEE IT. ITS SO POSITIVE AND GREAT FOR EVERYONE. I COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING. I ALSO SANG MY LUNGS OUT.
628,6,"-i loved this movie! it had an awesome plot and great music! it was just as good as the first movie, if not better! i loved it and it was so good! it really kept me in the plot the whole time."
629,6,"-frozen 2 is WAY better than the first one. it answers so many questions about the old movie. and for the parents with younger kids, a war is mentioned and elsa almost dies. that's all i have to say."
630,6,"-Frozen 2 is a surprisingly good movie! I expected it to be half par, not near as good as the first one.  I went into it expecting the happy, sing along, mild peril feature that the first one had been. I am here to tell you that this is not the same as the original. "
631,6,-Has a few emotional scenes that made everyone in the theater cry .....songs were good ...... new characters were GREAT....... I liked it and definitely recommend it
632,6,-Flawless
633,6,"-(No spoilers) The whole thing was seriously interesting and engaging! I'm 16 now, and it actually gave me a similar feeling of interest, excitement and nostalgia after seeing it that the first one did when I was 10. A lot of teens try to seem cool by acting like they're too old for movies like these, but to me, these kinds of movies are all I could really wish for in this world nowadays. The songs are great, the score (the soundtrack/background music) is great. It could be a little scary at times depending on the kid, but my 4 year old sister made it though and loved it, despite the moments that she claims she got a little scared. Good amount of everything that makes a movie good (family friendly/well made). They did a really good job of carrying the magic over and conveying it in a way that got the teens experiencing the same pleasure and excitement they felt when they saw the first film those 6 years ago. I highly recommend it, and any of you ""too old"" kids, go ahead and give it a chance."
634,6,-I kinda like this because.... Well there's a horse!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
635,8,"-I think frozen is a nice movie for young children, amazing songs, a very good movie!"
636,8,"-Frozen has ***SPOILER ALERT*** tragic (not graphic) parent death early on. Later, the sisters grow up apart and isolated from each other. Also, Elsa has to hide her power, going so far as to always wear gloves. This is later resolved when Elsa sings the powerful number about being one's true self. Anna meanwhile, gets engaged to a man she met on the first day, only to learn he's a monster (figuratively) and goes on to learn that love takes time and trust and honesty. This movie's themes are self acceptance, sisterly love, understanding, love takes time, and we need each other. All in all it's an amazing movie with important themes and wonderious music."
637,8,-This movie was very exiting.
638,8,"-There is literally nothing worthwhile in this movie. I like the feminist message, but it's terrible. Don't bother, it's not worth it."
639,8,-No Role Models. It's All About Violence And Sex
640,8,"-I really liked this movie,very interesting plot. Cute characters,fantastic animation.  Olaf is probably my favourite character. The let it go song was great and had awesome visuals. I really liked this movie for sure!❄"
641,8,-GREAT family movie.Love the characters.The movie starts with Elsa and Anna being great friends/sisters but Elsa's magic makes them drift apart     
642,8,"-Nothing more, nothing less."
643,8,-this movie is forking mint. NOT for children. ELsa shoots her sister almost killing her. this movie encurages kids to MURDER their siblings. Not good for your children. Good for only children to teach them the importance of being an only child.
644,8,"-In the Film i Like olaf the snowman, he sings summer, melts in a fireplace (But stops melting), In a home with trolls, olaf tells anna to run        while he distrasts them! says ""Hi! I'm Olaf and I Like Warm Hugs!""(warning: these are spoilers so if you have not seen the movie yet maybe stop reading!)"
645,8,"-It's okay in parts, but it's a bit slow to start off with. Theres just to many songs and not enough plot, I ended up a bit bored. Ana the main character is a bit stupid and aggrees to marry a guy the evening the meet. Elsa is taught to do the exact opposite of what the troll guys say at the beginning and learns to fear her powere. The snowman was a bit annoying and overall I can't really see what everybodies raving on about."
646,8,"-I watched this for the first time in august with my family online for free. While I was watching it, I saw the part where Elsa sings Let it go. I thought that was the best part of the movie, but everything else?? Nuh-uh. Personally, I think the 80's anime series Saint Seiya is better."
647,8,"-Frozen is a great Disney animated movie that will be loved by all ages! Both of the Royal sisters send positive messages to viewers. Queen Elsa has a powerful ice magic gift, but is too scared to use it for fear of hurting the ones she cares about, specifically her younger sister, Princess Anna. However, once her powers are revealed, Elsa soon learns that it's okay to be different, and others will accept het for who she is. The hit song ""Let It Go"" performed by the spectacular Idina Menzel, shows that no matter who you are, you should never be afraid to just let it go and show off what you can do. Princess Anna's strong passion for her sister urges the young girl on a dangerous mission that she might not return from. She teaches people that no matter what, family is everything, and if you stick together, you can acomplish anything from climbing a mountain to surviving a Frozen Heart"
648,8,-this movie is great. it tells you about sister life!!
649,8,-I saw this movie in a theater and I liked it but I wouldn't recommend it for all kids though but it may be ok for most.
650,8,"-I'm not trying to be a sourpuss, but well I am a teen girl and unlike most teen girls I hated this movie. There are so many scary scenes think should a 3-6 year old be watching a character freeze to death, a princess almost get stabbed have there hear frozen. Stick with the classics like Beauty and the beast one of my favorite movies. The only character I liked was Sven. And this is not the first movie to teach girls that you don't need a man, beauty and the beast, Mulan, Brave."
651,8,-Yes I know 'a modernised take' doesn't sound too great but actually I was quite surprised to find out this film was a perfect family film. It has entertaining characters a strong story and ..... well it's just a lovely film and if I was younger I would be happy to call this my childhood film.
652,8,-bad movie so don't even bother it was 52% good and 48% bad. Violence:Violence is when a girl which is cursed makes ice spikes and when a girl safe fire at wolves and an ice monster shouts at someone Language: not a problem Sex: not a problem
653,8,"-Your daughters will LOVE this movie if they love disney animation princess movies like this one. The movie's animation is stunning and beautiful especially the opening sequences with the snowflakes. The animaters did a superb job with the animation in the movie. You also learn that you don't need a guy to save you in this movie. You will love the characters. Elsa is the oldest sister. She is very protective of her family and friend particularly her younger sister Anna. Elsa also melts frozen peoples hearts with love. Elsa loves her sister Anna. She wants to be the person she truly is even though she has ice powers. She wants to let it go and be the person she truly is. Elsa is voiced really well by Idina Menzel. Elsa is a great big sister in the movie and you'll clearly see why. Anna is her little sister. Anna wants to find true love but later on in the movie learns what true love really is. Love is putting someone else's needs before your own. Anna is also clumsy,loves chocolate,and longs for adventure. Anna is a great little sister especially in one scene in the movie. Olaf is a snowman who says "" Hi everyone I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs."". Olaf is a very likable snowman. He's funny in the movie and a very likable character. You can clearly see why. The movie is based off of Hans Christian Anderson's The snow queen. Frozen has more positive messages and isn't dark unlike the story it was based off of. You learn a lot of messages about the importance of sisterhood and family in the movie. Frozen grossed over $1 billion dollars worldwide. Good job Disney!!! You will love the soundtrack in the movie as well as the animation Definitely deserves an A+. You will not be disappointed in this film. It's also a classic for Disney princesses all over the world."
654,8,"-The movie is amazing! Everything is appropriate, the songs are really catchy, and it has funny characters (Olaf of course)."
655,8,-I thought frozen was a very boring and dissapointing movie. It had 2 princesess. Very girly.
656,8,-viewers need to know that frozen is an animated movie based on 2 sisters who's parents pass away. there is a really good story behind the movie it tells girls that you don't need a by to love you.
657,8,-I love the movie but common sense are such liars.
658,8,-I just love this movie because it teaches little children about love and care for each other and that love is something that happens in a couple days not in love at first sight!!
659,8,"-I think Frozen is a beautiful, funny, and adventurous movie. It contains love but the love is sisterly love between Elsa and Anna. I love it when Olaf says, ""[gasp] I have my own personal flurry!""."
660,8,"-it was an ok movie, but everyone says it's all ""girl power"", and that's the most inaccurate thing i've EVER heard! first off, all the girls have heads too big for their bodies and giant eyes, whereas the guys look HUMAN! and anna couldn't have made it into the mountains without the dude's help (what was his name). and elsa was made out to be a coward. plus i'm the only person in the world who doesn't like let it go."
661,8,"-It was okay, but really wasn't as good as I expected when I saw the trailer. I like the whole moral about true love, and I do like that the girl is saved by the girl instead of the boy."
662,8,"-Nothing too scary, just some swords and kissing (2 moments), but overall, you should be fine to take anyone to this movie.  But, if you take a little 5-year-old, they might just want to buy everything Frozen after the movie."
663,8,-it is a good family film. i recermend you to watch it
664,8,"-This movie is amazing, although I wish they didn't make Hans the bad guy, I thought Hans was going to end up with Elsa and kristoff and Anna were going to end up together, but over all I think it was the best Disney movie ever!"
665,7,-This is one of the best animated movies I have ever seen and I have seen a lot! It has great morals and has very high replay video. I saw this movie twice on a computer and once in theaters. This is for all ages!
666,7,-The movie is so much fun! The messages are great and I'd recommend it for all ages! The movie is so funny and the songs are very catchy. The plot-line is original and even adults enjoy it. The songs are so much fun and Olaf has many funny quotes. Amazing movie!
667,7,"-This movie is awesome. Both of the girls are really tough, and the animation and songs are both awesome. I can have a song stuck in my head really easily."
668,7,"-I really loved this movie. Unlike an ""original"" Disney princess movie, it's not about finding a prince. Frozen has great lessons and messages, but there are also some parts that little kids might be scared of, such as (spoiler) the snow monster Marshmallow and the fight between Hans and the guards and Marshmallow. Otherwise it's a great movie."
669,7,"-This instant classic is already a hit with Disney fans around the world. Once you see it, you won't be able to get the songs out of your head. For days. Yes, it is that good. With quite possibly the biggest plot twist (except for that Wreck-It-Ralph shocker) in Disney history, this movie will send chills down your spine every time you see it. The only issue was the condensed story to fit the limited time frame. It seemed so rushed and unplanned. Overall, though, this movie never fails to impress both the younger and older audiences with both breathtaking animation and show-stopping tunes that your daughter won't stop singing."
670,7,"-Sweet movie. I loved it. I might be a dilettante when it comes to movie reviews, but this stressed the love between sisters. So sweet."
671,7,"-Perfect for the whole family.  Disney movies, who knew?"
672,7,"-Some scenes may be scary for children (A main character almost dies) but overall there's no gore, virtually no sex related stuff just one kiss, no swearing and this is actually a really good movie, as a 13 year old I still enjoyed it, the songs were pretty good."
673,7,"-I love it I would give it five out of five stars. The movie is about two sisters, one has ice powers and the other one is ordinary. Have you seen Tangled? If so, then you should definitely see frozen. I am totally sure that you will love it."
674,8,"-I think that this is too much for younger children (under 12) I just don't think that younger children would watch this, but what I think it is, it's really just a porn movie."
675,8,"-Lots of action packed scenes with explosives and car crashes.  Some fight scenes with guns.  Only a couple curses.  The movie itself is very good.  Also, the soundtrack is really good to.  A sad movie that you won't want to miss."
676,8,-The 7th fast and furious film says farewell to Paul walker. With great action and extreme stunt. But not for kids not teens as there is swearing and intense peril.
677,8,"-loved every moment, non stop action, plenty of car chases, few girls in bikinis, great stunts! bit of swearing. "
678,8,"-Furious 7 was one of my  most anticipated movies EVER. And it did not disappoint. Violence, language and moderate nudity with lots of sexual references. Violence- some blood, explosions, gun fights, fist fights and plain mayhem. Language- Lots of s words 30 probably. 15 d words, 22 a words, 1 f word 12 b words and some others. Sex- Pretty strong nudity with rear female nudity for about 10-15 minutes with g-string bikinis dancing on poles in a Dubai club scene. Lots of drinking and great models makes this movie a A+ excitement action flick"
679,8,-Violence-5/10
680,8,-A great movie.Everything was amazing. I watched it in the cinema with my cousin and younger siblings. My little sister was irritated by the disturbing content but my brother and I loved it.
681,8,"-This is the sequel to the 2013s hit Fast & and Furious 6,except this time there fighting the bad guy Owen Shawn's  brother. This sequel is insanely violent,characters are stabbed,shot,bashed,have there skulls cracked,necks broken,heads bashed,other characters fall to there death,lose there limbs,or explode to bits. Even though none of the violence is graphic or even realistic is still over-the-top. There is also lots of nudity/scantily clad women,breasts,and bottoms are seen through panties and bras,theres also tons of innuendo and sexual references. There is tons of frequent strong language including 1 f--k 20+ s--t a-hole b---h and son of a b---h. This movie is very thrilling,awesome,slick,and no where near boring but it still is to violent for even the oldest teens. My rating:R for strong violence throughout,bloody images,disturbing images,and some sexual content/nudity."
682,6,"-very very weird, pretty bad graphics too. (more comedy than scary. not scary at all)"
683,6,"-This is a really great classic movie. It's not a masterpiece obviously, but it's really funny! A few scenes needed for skipping, like implied sexual content that is never shown, but you definitely can tell what is going on. We skipped these scenes obviously, so I recommend you do the same. The language isn't too bad. This move now days I believe would be rated PG-13 but it's still really funny and I think everyone should watch it because its such a  classic. One more question for you.... who you gonna call?"
684,6,-This movie was disappointing because of the sexual content and not-even-comical stupidity. PG is not a good rating for this movie.
685,6,-You need to know at the 3rd scene there is a really scary ghost it’s about 10mins in the movie it’s when the ghostbusters come to check the library and near the end off the scene the ghost screams and turns in a skeleton and there’s another scene when one of the ghostbusters dreams of a ghost and it is not appropriate for younger kids.
686,6,-This is a really funny movie but has some questionable material.
687,6,"-Good for ages 11+. It has some violence, sex, and swearing."
688,6,"-Ghostbusters is an awesome movie, but there's plenty of swearing. I would rate this movie PG-13 for the language. Also, in most scenes one of the ghostbusters is smoking a cigarette. For a mature audience I definitely recommend this movie!!"
689,6,-A LITTLE SCARY FOR KIDS :(
690,6,-The ghosts look really good animated and so are the proton streams
691,8,"-My rating: pg-13 for some violence, implied sex, some language including 2 d**ks, and smoking"
692,8,"-This movie was just average to me. It was nothing too special, just a little comedy that tries a bit too hard. But, with all i can say about this movie I can definitely say that this is a classic just because of the stay puft marshmallow man. Over all just a decent movie."
693,8,-Good movie
694,8,"-This iconic movie may appear to be a scary horror movie, however when you actually sit down to watch it you will realise that it is not at all scary other than a few brief appearances of ghosts. It is worth noting, however, that there are many hidden sexual innuendos in this movie, but whether this movie is suitable for children depends upon whether they understand the sex jokes or not. All in all, it is a great and hilarious classic."
695,8,"-Classic comedy is alright, but lacks something.... ?"
696,8,"-I don't feel I even need to write a full review. It's a creative, original, fun, and action packed classic. If you haven't already, then what are you still doing here? GO see it right now!"
697,8,-I LOVE Ghostbusters 1 and 2!
698,8,"-This is my favorite movie, but there are a few negative elements I suggest vidangeling out (ghost oral sex, launguege). This has great messages including teamwork and friendship."
699,8,"-This film is from the 80s and like most films from that timeline it has language the s word is said at least 5 times in the film, one of the characters has a dream where he gets Oral pleasure from a ghost. And Peter is a borderline sexual predator. overall great film, but not for small kids"
700,8,"-I liked the movie but it can be scary for younger kids.It also includes:language,Lots of smoking,and in some scenes lots of sex.Crude humor is in Ghostbusters too."
701,8,-I found out that Santa was not real when I was 9. The gremlins die in a rather violent way but mature 9 year olds can handle this only if they know about Santa
702,8,"-My family and I were looking for a good 80s movie. We went to Netflix and saw Gremlins. At first we didn't want to watch it, but then when it started, it got really funny. Especially Gremlins swinging on the fan."
703,8,"-This movie is an amazing classic!!!!!  What people need to know about Gremlins is that there is some violence, but most is just gremlins getting killed.  There is some blood, but most is gremlin blood, which is green, this might make it seem less violent.  Most of the gremlin blood is shown in a few scenes where a mother fights off a small group of gremlins.  The only human blood is mostly just scratches attained by character who survive the movie.  There is a little language but nothing really bad.  In one part gremlins smoke and drink beer.  The final confrontation with the last gremlin might scare young kids.  Overall, this movie isn't necessarily scary and a great classic that is definitely worth watching."
704,8,"-This film is not your typical ""boy-gets-pet"" style film. This came out before PG-13 ratings. If it was re-rated, it would be PG-13 (like Jaws). This film is intense and surprisingly frightening, but a well done job by Steven Spielberg. Gremlins are gruesomely killed along with grizzly human deaths and attacks. Humans are bitten, scratched, and killed by gremlins. Gremlins mainly jump onto humans and cling on, and start attacking. A old woman is killed by them, thinking they're demons trying to ""take her,"" by her elevating chair's wires are tampered with by gremlins and send it spiraling it up the stairs at about 80 mph and send her through a window. Many car crashes. A man tries to lure out a gremlin with a candy bar, he is then bitten and is shown with him lying on the ground with a syringe in his butt, never revealed if he was killed or unconscious. Gremlins chase a couple into a house with a snowplow (they survive). Most human deaths are off screen, leaving the viewer to imagine extremely gruesome deaths. A gremlin is killed in a blender, green blood/slime spews everywhere. Another one is repeatedly stabbed (off screen). A gremlin's shoved into a microwave and explodes into a green blood/slime pulp all over the inside of the microwave. Another gremlin's decapitated, it's head is show burning in a fire place. A kid shoots gremlins with a sling shot off his roof. He fights off another one by cutting Christmas lights, leaving the gremlin to fall. It doesn't show if the gremlins die from the fall in this scene. Gremlins burn to death and then explode when a gas leak is lit in a movie theater. Gremlins shoot/threaten with guns. A man is shot is the arm with a crossbow by Spike and is then attacked with a chainsaw. (SPOILER) The ""leader"" gremlin, Spike, is killed when exposed to sunlight. His skin melts off, revealing muscle tissue, his eyes roll into the back of his head, and wails in pain. His corpse falls into a fountain, his bones jump out, and then melt into a goo. (SPOILER OVER) Gizmo is some-what of a good role model of how he follows the rules and refuses to eat after midnight unlike the other gremlins. Once the gremlins turn, they become creepy instead of cuddly, and may scare young children. Some jump-scares. Constant usages of ""hell,"" ""d@mn,"" ""god,"" ""Jesus,"" ""Jesus Christ,"" etc. But it's mild. Gremlins drink like fishes, and smoke. Some gremlins are clearly wasted. Worst in sexual stuff is a gremlin ""flasher,"" but they don't has visible genitals, so is not that bad. One kiss scene. Mild flirting. This is a must see film, but for tweens and up. Fine for 11+"
705,8,"-Gremlins was the first horror/comedy that I watched and I watched it 5 years ago and it didn't scare me. It doesn't have any swear words, the violence is tamer than most kids films. Good movie for the family."
706,8,"-It is so cute when Gizmo drives the little car, and when he waves the flag! I really enjoyed this movie."
707,8,-Okay let's be fair this movie was made before pg 13 was invented but that story about that girls father is devastating to me I really hate storys were people get stuck in there own house and no one knows. I watched this movie when I was like 5 or 6 and I don't remember that part I watched it again and that part was just awful I wouldn't recommend it to any one under 11.
708,8,"-Cool movie. It's not my favorite, but my 7 year old brother really likes it. (He's obsessed!) Summary: (WARNING: SPOILER ALERT!) "
710,8,-I think gremlins is a good movie but best for tweens and teens because it has quite a bit of violence and scariness but this is my favorite movie of all time
711,7,"-So the movie started out a little weird but then it was the usual Rocket Racoon, Baby Groot, Star-Lord and, Gamora. There are also lot of funny scenes with baby Groot . Then they start fighting bad guys. Later they get attacked but win. Character drama happens here and there. There was a lot of family reunion stuff along with references to the 1st movie. I think any 10 year old should be allowed watch this movie."
712,7,"-This was an amazing sequel and yet again it had a great plot, great acting, but had more humor and sci-fi action! The film does contain plenty of language including several uses of s**t, d**k, plus more. Also the film contains plenty of suggestive content. This involves sexual tension between several characters, and some mild sexual references. However, this film does not skimp on the sci-fi violence and action and definitely amps it up are than the first film. Just like the first film there is plenty of combat, swords, guns, tasers, and shoot-outs and explosions, plus a high body count. Overall this is a great sequel that is great for kids 12 and up."
713,7,"-so awesome. there wasnt anything too bad except for a few ""f--k""s and ""s--t"". it was also very funny."
714,7,-I had no idea what was going on? This could have been due that I did not watch the first. It was also very silly (in a ridiculous way) and there were lots of curse words.
715,7,-ANOTHER CLASSIC action comedy  with great messages burderned by some content! still entertaining
716,7,"-This movie was hillarious and amazing. It had enough sex jokes to give it its rating but it also had some family friendly jokes that the younger aundience would get. There is one part that I would cover my kids ears for. There is one scene when Star Lords father was talking about his mother and how Star Lord came to Be and Drax asked him if he had a penis and full details about them having sex. He also said that his father would tell him stories when he was a child about him making his mother pregnant. Thats really it for the sexual content. Language is really what you would expect to see in a PG-13 movie. S**t, Dough bag, D**k, ass, ass hole, B**ch, bastard, and danmmit. I think that this movie is appropiate for kid who know what sex and when it is appropiate for it to happen and can hanndle some language. Hope this helped"
717,7,"-i think that this was even better than the first one i also think that that one review about how it was not good for kids and it lowers  a girl self esteem . newsflash , those girls in the club were robots, therefore in my opinion , it was fine. by the way i also watche this in the cinema with my younger brothers ages 8 and 5 . and they were not affected at all."
718,7,"-This action packed sequel was more funny than the first movie but the plot was more confusing and not quite as interesting. In the first spectacular film I laughed out loud about two times. In this great add on I must have laughed at least ten more. Baby groot was so much more funny than ordinary groot and he had a hilarious role in the opening scene. Chris Pratt had some very good acting and Rocket (the raccoon) actually got emotional in a few scenes. The profanity in this movie was not as frequent however it ended up having about the same amount  as the first movie because it was very, very long. This movie also had some dazzling effects but it was sometimes pretty brutal. The plot of the movie was a little more confusing because the team split up for some of the movie and it kind of changed about one third through the film. Other than the violence I think something to know that this movie has some sexual content, some subtle while some is pretty obvious such as one reference to a man's body parts. However if your child is mature than that would not be an issue at all. There were a few sad scenes and as common sense media already stated a character dies but he does it to save his friends which I thought was a good twist. My favorite character was actually not Groot and in fact a new character named Mantis who is an alien who can sense the emotions of living creatures and even change them. The funny thing is that when she is not using her powers she does not understand emotions so she often gets them mixed up such as a character calls her ugly and this makes her happy. Another major role in the movie is the addition of eighties music which is still used very often in this movie. This is a great movie for a family movie night or to see in theaters with a friend. Thank you for reading my review."
719,8,-This is one of the best marvel movies I saw ever besides ant man it had action laughs and it was just fun a great marvel movie
720,8,-This movie is awesome so let a lot of tweens see this. The violence and swearing is like most other superhero movies.
721,8,-This is the best marvel movie ever! Great comedy great action great storyline! I'm gonna watch Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 tonight. I'm hoping it's gonna be good!
722,8,"-It is a great movie, but there is a lot of violence and swearing. There is a little consumerism when the movie shows that Peter's music player is Sony brand."
723,8,"-This movie is unlike most other Marvel movies in that it has a less dark tone. There is more humour than you may expect, and there are several cheerful and upbeat songs to relieve moments of tension. However, there is also a lot of fantasy violence which is expected from a Marvel movie set in outer space.  There is some strong language and one sad moment, however the overall message is positive."
724,8,-A gang of space oddballs unite to save the Galaxy.
725,8,"-Although being an almost- Unknown comic , Marvel did a great job bringing it alive in an entertaining, humorous film. If I were u, I think u should start watching this franchise."
726,8,"-Quality: This is a really good movie and I can't wait for it's sequel. Just like all marvel movies, it's hardcore action, but it's also hilarious, seriously, apart from the first scene, every scene had at least one joke that made me laugh out loud. Great movie, entertaining all the way through, I really recommend that you see it."
727,8,"-There are lots of reviews that say that this movie has lots of violence, sex, etc. But there is really not too many things that are (or should be) concerning. This movie is definitely one of the least violent marvel movies. I do not know why people are saying that there is so much violence and sex and drugs and swearing."
728,8,-Great movie but not for the younger children a lot  of swearing in s..t and f..k but very funny and exciting i think this is a movie many people will enjoy.
729,8,"-I keep seeing all the same things on here-a bunch white, conservative, super religious moms who are flipping out over how “offensive” and “perverted” this movie is. Like would you please let it go and shut up already. Look-the movie has like one or two innuendos in it like a lot of movies do. Get over it. People watching this apparently seem to forget that when the penguins talk about finding a mate, they mean finding love and happiness. And when penguins become mates, they have sex. Any joke you find too offensive your child will likely be too young to understand. Having sex and mates is what penguins too in the wild. Don’t listen to the other reviews telling you how awful this movie is and how it’s too perverted. The penguins sing to each other. One or two of the lyrics are a bit sexual. That’s about it. Move on and get over it. Your kid will probably enjoy this movie just be aware of a few scary scenes witha leopard seal and you’re all good. Please stop getting offended over a bunch of penguins singing old pop love songs to each other. Your kid is eventually going to learn about sex anyway."
730,8,-pengguins shouldnt talk
731,8,-This my favourite movie of all time!
732,8,"-I watched this in school, and I’ll be honest - it was rather disappointing. While the characters were cute and the message good, there were not just innuendos, but scenes entirely centered around penguins mating. Personally, I feel like the adult humer was a bit over the top. "
733,8,"-This movie is simply adorable. Lots of cute penguin power, with a powerful message of being unique. Definitely a great movie for families. WARNING: Only a smidge of scariness/intense scenes. Movie focused around penguins finding mates - film suitable for older children"
734,8,"-I saw this movie when I was only three and loved the singing, dancing, and animals. The message convey in the story is very true in reality today. The songs are live songs so yes they have sexual refreances, but the kids won't catch on unless you make a big deal about it. The anti-christinan message is not what the movie show rather that believing that someone that doesn't nessassery follow the guidelines is causing all the trouble is very wrong and that everyone is different their own speical way. Perfect for young viewers and older viewers as well. Plus mating is nature stop making a huge deal about it. All animals do it and alot sing to get a mate and keep the circle of life going."
735,8,"-Parents if you're are bringing your child to see this movie I think (my opinion) you should. Why? You may ask, because they're children, and  the adult jokes will just fly over their heads, and they shouldn't be scared of the movie (I read that in the parents review) it's a freaking kids movie! There's nothing to be afraid of! And if they do get scared just wait until they're older. "
736,8,"-I saw this movie with my family at home, and I just couldn't believe all the innuendos packed into this ""kids' movie."" It made me extremely uncomfortable. There was no reason for the filmmakers to include so much inappropriate stuff in what could have otherwise been an innocent, fun kids' movie. This stuff won't just ""fly over kids' heads."" They'll be able to tell by their parents' shocked faces that this isn't something they should be watching. DO NOT watch. Very disappointing. I really do think that the only people who should be watching this movie are adults, or very mature teens.  But even then, who would want to watch it anyway? Along with the innuendos, there are also many racial stereotypes, and the movie portrays humans as these monsters that are destroying the planet. All in all, this movie is so filled with bad things that no kid will ever get the intended message of ""being yourself."""
737,8,-This is a KIDS Movie. Bad Parents (and some kids).
738,7,"-This film has an interesting storyline, but I think it's quite gory for younger kids. Ron coughs up slugs and words are painted in red on the walls. Also, there is blood on the sword when Harry stabs the basilisk and blood flowing out when Harry stabs a book. "
739,7,-This movie is amazing and it is so cool to watch Harry find out more and more about the wizarding world. Another good thing is that the book is short so they can literally fit everything into the movie
740,7,-Yes I know only one scary bit and one cringey bit the scary bit is where the camera is shaking and Rons youngest sister was riting on the walls (with blood) and the cringey bit is the Phoenix pecking the eyes out of the snake  (kinda of camera kinda not) in a shadow I don’t remember swear words they might be I don’t remember and the whomping willow might scare some young kids and other Bits like Children being super scared by the snake including Collin and also Malloy gets hit on the head with a plank of wood and Ron gets sick and like spit slugs Because he had a broken wand and backfired also gildory Lockhart took his wand and he lost he’s mind and never know who he was forever (+ he is a conman)
741,7,"-Chamber of Secrets is grossly underrated. This is a more bloody, violent adventure, but nonetheless one told beautifully."
742,7,-This is ok to me it couldn't be any more innapropriate than the first
743,7,-It was a really good movie. You like it two! But be careful because some scenes give me the wiggles because they are scary! Right? I hope you like it. Well bye dudes. I just love it when I fly in the ocean.
744,7,"-I preferred the movies while Chris Columbus was directing. They were kinda more child-centered. So 1 and 2 were easier to watch for me, but I like all of them. There were a lot of funny things, like Fred and George's faces when they got yelled at for flying the car. And Ron's when he got the Howler. The darker and scarier aspects aren't that bad, either. But nothing can beat the book, and that's why there's four stars. There are great messages and role models like all the books and movies. And the violence is very light."
745,7,"-I really liked the book so I decided to watch the movie. I loved it, although I pictured a lot of things differently in my head. There was a part near the end that was really scary. All the special effects were really cool! But, it is very long. Overall, I think this is a good movie for families with kids 8 and up due to some scary scenes. Thanks for reading this review and I hope you try this movie!"
746,7,-It is not too scary but the last 15 minutes are scary you may want to skip the last 15 minutes.
747,8,-I had it for movie night and me and my little brother both loved it. There were only a couple of nasty bits!
748,8,-Read the book then see it. It is dark and not vary good fore under 13.
749,8,"-Really good movie, but it leaves out a lot. It's a little scary; someone cuts off his hand, harry gets stabbed in the arm, and a boy is killed, so it's definitely not for younger kids."
750,8,-This is a great movie but there are a few scary scenes.
751,8,-My sister watched this movie when she was 5 years old. If you watched Prisoner of Askaban you can certainly watch this movie. It is a great movie about teamwork and helping a friend in need. It does show an unconscious body and does have the killing curse in it. There are two final scenes in the film that you have to worry about. One includes Harry and a boy's father screaming in peril after his son died. Another is that there is a scene (SPOILER ALERT) where mad eye moody turns back into his real form without the polyjuce potion and there is a brief moment where his transformation is disturbing. Other than those two I think you'll be OK.
752,8,-It is the BEST movie ever my little brother is 6 and never looked away! Some intense scenes and suspense but amazing movie!
753,8,-I think that the harry potter series are the best books ever written
754,6,-Not too much from the book version appeared in this movie. I was really looking forward to the veelas but guess what? It got skipped! Another major thing they left out were the characters Ludo Bagman and Winky the house elf.  I think you should read the book first. Although many parts weren’t used this film was incredible and we all loved it. Nothing too scary at least not for me and my 5 year old brother.
755,6,-This is a good movie. I watched the whole Harry Potter series when I was like 10. Watch it with you kids if you think they’ll get too scared or skip over the bad parts. If things are inappropriate most likely your kids will not get it unless they’re old enough too. Parents sensor kids too much sometimes.
756,6,-This movie is epic. I think there is to much violence for younger kids but not much blood.
757,6,"-Scary! Most of this movie is kid appropriate, but the end is very very scary!! Good movie though, and kids 9 - 14 will enjoy it"
758,6,-HARRY POTTER 4 contains mild violence. That's all parents will need to know.
759,6,"-Although it’s a bit violent, I think that kids will see this movie without your permission, I recommend you to watch it with them so you can talk about the message in this movie instead of making them watched behind you backs that is way much worse than watching a bit of violence, also kids have seen much more violence than in this movie"
760,6,"-I watched this with my family and I chose not to watch harry getting sliced of the cutting off the hand, but honestly it wasn't that scary at all. My sister is 7 and she watched it all."
761,6,"-I think that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was too scary for my little brother who was 4 and was scared in his bed after watching. Spoiler alert: The part with the dark lord was a very dark scene, and when the dark lord came out of the cauldron it was too scary."
762,8,-Harry potter  and the Half-Blood prince book and movie was incredibly awesome! We can relate a lot from Harry Potter and learn  great lessons from the series...
763,8,-but it's ok for what it is. See you on a two parter review!
764,8,"-I love the Harry Potter books, but when it comes to the movies, it's a complete different story. Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince dived into more of a romance story. Sixteen year olds finding true love and all. But was it a good love story between Harry and Ginny in the movies? No! Seriously, they made Ginny almost emotionless. Book Ginny would never do a thing like having awkward kiss moments and tie shoelaces at the weirdest moment. Not the actress's fault, because she did what was on the script. Not just Ginny, but Ron, too. The screenwriter and director must've hated Ron, because now they give all the credit to Hermione for comforting Harry, and Ron just sits there daydreaming at the last scene! "
765,8,-I thing that this was a great movie!!! It had a good plot line and everything. I saw this when I was about 11 or 10 and I loved it. Now I was reading some of the parent reviews and I thought that it was weird that they thought someone being killed on screen was bad. Now I get your point but it showed no blood or any odious sign that they were dead other than a lifeless body! I think this is a great movie for kids 10+ because of what I just described. Thanks for reading!
766,8,-I think 9+ is fine if they are watching with a parent or someone above 12. This movie has violance but not to muchto be scared of. Their is some kissing but the plot is immpecable. I love this movie so much... its my favorite one. I think the whole harry potter franchise should be 10+ it isnt bad at all.
767,8,-Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is so good! only one thing that scared me was the  Inferi . Dumbledore's death was also a little scary but over all this is a good movie.
768,8,-Should be watched. A bit of violence.
769,8,-I hate this movie. It is very scary. DO NOT WATCH IT!
770,8,"-When writing the book, this was my least favorite because to show Harry's puberty, she spend hundreds of thousands of words just on the drama in Harry's emotions. But we'll skip to the movie."
771,8,"-I think this film is very fun to watch with families and has an intense storyline. Personally, it’s one of my least favourites from the series but it’s still amazing. Should definitely watch!"
772,8,"-Ohmygodsogood! Even though it was darker than the previous films, you find out more about Voldemort. Harry gets angry, but his friends help him. Continues the recurring theme of friendship and defeating evil. Ron swears a loooot (again), but nothing too bad. Again, soooo gooooood! (10+ at least, very scary; the death eaters and Voldemort kinda freaked me out, but that's just me.)"
773,8,-This is a epic movie but there is quite a scary bit near the end with Lord Voldemort  but if you look closely he looks quite funny. There is a new character introduced called Luna Lovegood .
774,8,-This movie is so good! The tension started in the very begging and you want to watch more and more. This movie is appropriate for ages 8 and up. It is outrageous that CSM rated this film 12 and up.
775,8,"-Some violence and fantasy, but overall it's a great film and I love it.  Good female role model in Hermione too."
776,8,"-Harry sauve... de detraqueur, le minister de la magie ne le croi pas.Voldemort est de retour,une nouvelle gerre commence,Dombeldor crée L' ordre du phénix."
777,7,"-Lighthearted, but scary stuff is too much for littlest kids."
778,7,"-I have no Idea how adults come up with the gory and gruesome ratings, They is simply animated figthing, I think a two year old would find this scary"
779,7,"-This movie was incredible! I really like the graphics and editing. I give it a 5-star!! WHAT PARENTS NEED TO KNOW: It's a great movie, but not so much for young children. I would recommend at least 7 and older to watch. There are partial scenes where Hercules's trainer (Phil) treats girls in a non-appropriate way. Although, you can't get mad at Disney. The movie setting is located in ancient Greece, so it's very common to see things like that. There are scary scenes where Hades forces monsters and terrifying creatures to try to kill Hercules. Which, they all end up failing. There is another scene where Hades tricks Hercules into saving two little boys trapped under a rock. The two little boys are actually Hades's helpers, (Pain and Panic). Of course, Hercules ends up getting the rock off of them, but then we see a huge monster appear out of the cave, and Hercules ends up having to battle it. The monsters, or so called ""Titans"" are released by Hades, which then, he makes them try to kill Zeus so he can rule. These monsters might come off as scary to some children. Throughout the whole movie, there is no sign of blood. Just bruises and scratches. Some children might find it scary when people die. Their soul comes out of their body, and sometimes screams. When Hades enters the underworld, he has to feed this three-headed dog. This might be scary. MY RECOMMENDATION: If you are a child 6 years old or under, please watch with parent supervision. Other than that, it is my favorite movie, and I definitely recommend watching it!!"
780,7,-This Disney movie is...different.
781,7,"-A not sensitive kid could watch this. Hades is not scary because he is too funny, I love his hair too lol. Hercules is tryna find where he belongs and then he’s like GASP IMMA GOD or something and meets Meg. She’s disturbingly skinny btw but nice. The little narrator ladies are very cute. Phil chases ladies but he’s cool 😎 xd. You should watch! One violent scene is when Hercules chops off a hydra head and then more grow back and he almost dies but you can skip over that little part. (:"
782,7,"-So I love this movie a lot but it’s definitely not for younger kids. It had a great story but got really off topic from Greek mythology and could be offensive to that culture. The violence could be scary if a little kid watches it. Also, Hercules boyfriend,  (the best Disney character in my opinion) is very sexual and cracks some jokes that are funny but most kids won’t understand. This movie has a lot of positive sides and good messages, but the violence and sexuality might be too much for some kids."
783,7,-Loved this film and its perseverance towards what it wants to be. Greek Gods is the way!
784,7,-Very good Disney classic should be on the low end of PG. This movie is not light on peril and being scary. Not for the littlest to watch.
785,7,-Im 15 and this has to be my favourite Disney  movie! I have absolutely loved it to bits ever since I first saw it. 
786,8,-As a SUPER fan of Hocas Pocas is the best Halloween movie ever. As everyone has already said it has a lot of the word “virgin” thrown in. The witch gets a little cuddly with a bus driver but it is honestly not that bad and is comical. If your sensitive with gore you might think that witches talking about tourchering and sucking childrens souls out is bad. But even that is not bad at all. Scary funny and awesome.
787,8,-Parents should know: 
788,8,"-This is a great movie. I first watched it when I was 5, and my 3 year old brother watched it with me. Me and him both loved it. When I was little I didn’t really remember them talking about virgin."
789,8,"-For most people Halloween is just Halloween, but for some people in Salem, Massachusetts, it’s a bit more. The Sanderson sisters are a legend to the people in Salem. It is said that they sucked the life force out of kids, to retain their youth. They were caught one day, and were hung, but it is said that a virgin will bring them back. This movie is a fun Halloween movie for the whole family. There is mild violence, but I think most older kids/tweens should be able to handle it. There is no sex, but there are a few references to being a virgin, and a few other mild sex innuendos. Most kids, however, would not notice it. Mild language is also present in the movie. All in all, Hocus Pocus is a really cute movie. I definitely recommend it for anyone during the Halloween season!"
790,8,-This movies is about 3 witches who come back after 300 years when a boy lights a candle.
791,8,"-Hocus Pocus is an okay movie. I thought it was pretty funny and sometimes cool. The movie is about 3 kids who go to an old shack that belonged to three witches long ago. They light a candle and the witches come back to life wanting to suck children’s souls out to regain their youth. It is a fun adventure movie but can be scary at times. Fortunately, the scariness is funny and not like the scariness in horror movies like Stephen King’s It."
792,8,"-There is alot of S*x cuz max's little sister mentions something about something max said that is weird, the Madonna outfit is also weird, and an elderly couple get in a fight because one of them dances with the blonde witch "
793,8,-I think this is a great film but wouldn’t recommend it to people who don't want their child to ask what a virgin is because there i slot of talk about that. There is also a part when the kids try to burn the witches to death. I think that this is a great film and you should defiantly watch this.
794,8,-It is really funny but there are some scary scenes like there is a zombie that gets his head torn off but still I think it is mostly funny and it is not very scary at all.
795,8,"-This is a great comedy classic it includes violence, and some language."
796,8,-0
797,8,-so so good but there are burglurs and the sound of a gunshot and traps over all it is a great movie
798,8,"-Fun Movie. There is a spider. Some swearing like ""s--t"", ""bitch"", and ""ass""."
799,8,-It is a great movie but too much swearing . WAY too much  but it  has a good moral.
800,8,-and i recommend it for all ages though the only bad effects is the fire and the iron and buckets though i bet young viewers would laugh.
801,8,-Super funny holiday-themed-slapstick-comedy-movie. Great main character and creative plot. Some of the slapstick parts might be disturbing to really young kids.
802,8,"-Super funny, language is fine and the violence is funny.  Honestly, this is the best holiday movie ever."
803,8,-GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
804,8,"-It is a great movie and all, with funny humor and situations, but even with, actually, especially with, the first, say, ten minutes there is a lot of disrespect going on in the Mccalister home (I probably spelled that wrong). No body seems to like Kevin, as they call him names like ""disease"" ""jerk"" ""le incompetent"" and so on. There are a few mild swearing as well. It's really not hard to see why they hate Kevin, because he's really a brat. He gets angry about stupid things and even calls his mom ""dummy"" and comments, ""Families suck!"" He of course learns his lesson, and for the rest of the movie the swearing is taken down a notch as well as the insults. The traps he sets for the burglars are comical, but sometimes very painful to watch. Most kids might laugh at it, but others might just cover their eyes. Overall, I think it's a good movie, just be careful what age you decide to show it to."
805,8,"-This movie is quite violent at the end, with the villains getting burned, hit in the head, falling down stairs, and more. I first watched this when i was six and I was terrified of it. Lots of name-calling and some swearing, but there aren't any movies without that these days. I've watched it about ten times, none of them because I had to watch it in school or anything, and I only watched the Grinch ( live-action) twice, once in school. Not the best role models, but Kevin does tend to be quite independant."
806,8,"-Words like, ""H*ll,"" ""*ss,"" And, ""D*mn."" If your kid has heard these words, it's fine. If not, maybe skip it. They also say, ""Shut up,"" ""Les incompetent,"" (Your kids probably wouldn't understand that) ""Stupid,"" and say, ""Ya filthy animal."""
807,8,"-This movie is really funny, and its one of my favs. There isn't a lot of cursing, but there is one scene where ""Santa"" is smoking a cigarette. It gets violent a little more than half way through the movie, but it's the best Part!! A must see."
808,8,"-Great Family Christmas movie, probably saw it the first time when I was 6 years old. There is a lot of comedic violence; and a few scenes where 8 year old Keven looks at his 14 year old brother Buffs Playboy magazines. But other than that a great funny entertaining movie the entire family will enjoy."
809,8,-This film is so funny. It has cartoonish violence and slapstick comedy. I watch this most Christmas’s and I never get bored of it. It has occasional use of mild swearing and may be unsuitable for younger children. Love this film!!!!
810,8,"-This is a must-watch! Watch this movie you will cry for how funny it is! This is a great movie for kids & family! Although, if your child is scared of ""bad guys"" sneaking into the house, they may want to wait longer because that is what happens, although Kevin (the main character), beats them up and tries to get rid of them in funny ways."
811,8,"-To be honest,this movie is really funny! Nothing is really major except for language "
812,8,"-it is a great  film for kid 11+.   It is a comedy that is so funny  it will knock your socks of! it has violence, language  and no sex. you better watch  soon."
813,8,-A great Christmas  classic. It includes funny fails. Tricky traps and endless fun! Beware of the language! Kevin is mean at first. We don't like when he calls his mom a bad name.  Good for responsible 8 year olds.
814,8,-Fun and quick witted Caper that will introduce kids to more advanced Heist movies.
815,8,"-This movie is a survival story about being left home. Kevin, the main character, had an annoying family, and wanted to be home alone. The next day, the family left home for Paris in a hurry, but forgot Kevin. He began to learn what life was like alone, along with the pesky Wet Bandits. At the end, the family returned, and everyone was happy."
816,8,-This is not a bad movie. I love this movie but their is so much profanity I feel like it cannot be just flown by like it is no big deal. The way the parents and the kids talk to each other is unacceptable! I would still watch it but mute some of the parts where you can tell profanity can happen
817,8,"-Fantastic, funny Christmas classic."
818,8,-Home Alone is an awesome movie. It isn't violent except for when the kid is fighting two burglars. It has one scary part where his furnace makes a creepy noise. There is also some mild cursing. Other then that it is fine for your kid 8 and up.
819,8,-A lot of humor but it can be very scary and inappropriate scenes.If you don't like swearing and violence you shouldn't watch this movie!
820,8,-Age Rating (My Opinion) : PG - 13 A
821,8,-this was a great movie but can be violent including guns creepy movies. And very frequent language.
822,6,"-This movie is really good! I think that its hilarious and it has a really good message! Ok so violence:theres really no violence besides the scary face thing that dracula does. ""Sexy stuff"": none besides two TINY kisses. Language: none. Consumerism: none. Drinking: none. Great movie! :)"
823,6,"-Greta movie for all families. I went to see this movie with my family and I thought ""This is gonna be a stupid little kid movie.."" But the movie was awesome. I normally enjoy a good PG-13 comedy but this was an awesome movie. And a shout out to autisticcaregvr: Really? You have nothing better to do? You make it sound like paranormal activity or a slasher movie! Parents: Do not listen to his review. This movie was meant to be a movie about a coming of age movie. Not a demonic movie."
824,6,"-This is a cute movie, but the kids 5 and under might not get he humor. There is some love (not an overdose, more like Disney Princess) and a lot of stars in this movie? The reason why I put language is because of the slight potty humor ( teeheehee), but at least the boys will be happy, Overall, a really sweet family movie, and a great addition to the movie collection"
825,6,"-Vampires?! Blood-suckers only make appearances in R-rated and PG-13-rated movies. I've never seen a vampire movie for kids, but I didn't like it. ""Sexy and I Know It"" by LMFAO is played in some scenes and I despise LMFAO!!!"
826,6,-hotel transilvania is a funny movie about draculas daughter who turns 118 years old she wants too see the world and see goes in the end hotel transilvania is a movie about a bond between a daughter and her father
827,6,-this movie is the best i saw i like 3 times and ill watch it more
828,6,-This is a great introductory to horror movies for kids under 10!
829,6,-Hotel Transylvainia is suitable for kids 7 and up with some minor scary parts.
830,6,"-dracula was funny,mavis is hot,johnathan can be annoying at times and the other characters were generally likeable except for the witches and especially the stupid,ugly unappealing zombies"
831,6,"-It is a really good movie.  It is really funny. I saw it two times and it even made my parents laugh out loud.  My mom covered my eyes when she saw kissing.  I took her hands off my eyes.  There is a little story where there is fire.  Also, the mom in the movie gets killed but the dad remains alive.  There is some scary music.  For little kids, there might be some scary parts, but otherwise I think it is a really good movie."
832,7,"-This movie is great for kids with imagination, or really anyone. It serves as a reminder that social outcast is no good, and shows some kickass dragons along the way. If you haven't seen it yet I don't know what your doing! Give it a watch with your kid or by yourself, you won't regret it!"
833,7,"-I think that for 10 and up, This shows a lot of caring and kind. It is also good for history."
834,7,-Funny intense may scare younger kids great messages and role models gooood
835,7,"-This movie, is a work of art. Everything just fits together in the end, and the characters have great development and the story is incredibly outstanding for a kids film."
836,7,"-How To Train Your Dragon is an animated blockbuster film, in which a young boy named Hiccup, who befriends a dragon named Toothless. It is a good movie for 6 and up"
837,7,"-It is a very interesting movie, it's fun, and entertaining, I have a lot of things in my head and heart that I can't type but I can say that I love that movie and I recommend it to a lot of people, please watch the 3 movies and the 2 series."
838,7,"-I have been watching this movie since it came out when I was four years old. I really like that even when every viking expected the main character to kill a dragon, he was brave and refused to do it. There was a cheesy crush that the main character had on a girl. The three (minor) things that I would warn about are 1. Teens talk about the scars they hope to get by battling dragons. 2. The main character's Dad gifts him a helmet made from his Mother's old breastplate. 3. There were some filler words (like the common sense review said) such as ""Thor almighty"". I recommend this great movie to anybody who is thinking about watching it."
839,7,"-The end was scary, so if you have any little kids, ask them if they need to take a break.  It has some sad parts, but this is a kids movie, so it will have a happy ending."
840,8,-The movie was terrible for me. I think it is only suitable for under 5 year olds (who don't understand it) and over 8 year olds (who are already older). I was very sad about some scenes. I will never forget the movie.
841,8,-The cat guy is really weird! #WALL-EGO-4M-Olover
842,8,"-Ice Age is FUN!, More Fun Than The New Ice Age Movie (Collision Course) I Recommend Watching The First Ice Age Movie"
843,8,-Ice age is one of the best animated  films that I have ever seen it has great laughs great story score and cast too highly recommend it.
844,8,-I love Ice Age!
845,8,"-I will says that is some but jokes but they will mostly hear those butt joke in daycare and school . The are some insane seen . It will teach your kid to trust and working together . Also have reabiltiy to trust again . It is aslo teach kids to not follow in peer preasure. It is funny .  I will say it will be good starting shows for those who are learning to talk . It is always better to start earlier .  I think those you rate 18 and plus are insane . The seen is a right amount of violence . I am okay to allow the acess with all kids . I seen many parents not supervising the kids and this how crazy you are so don't blame on you . It is better to keep this acess to kids and safe enviroment . I will mind keep your opion and my opion in oppositions .  I think this will kids the improtant of trust , workship , teamword , and different meanings of family or herd or flock or school ( fish) . My 2nd grade teacher said "" We are family and spread to school like a wild fire after from the ice age and we litimed to only one bully but he is not as bad as normal school bullys in other countries and states . It stay with also new added motto which is pretty similar to we are family . By the end of the day , We all are just the same  like water and rain ."
846,8,-Very good movie!
847,8,-Ice Age is one of those newer classics.  My brother and I love Sid the sloth a lot. He just cracks us up! We also like when Diego says “Where’s the baby? There he is!”  ( It was peekaboo.). I still feel bad for Manny that he lost his parents to humans but this movie is SO good. I understand why it got 82% in the reviews.
848,8,-Parents can know that i like this film. It is amazing! Especially if you are a Wooly Mammoth or a Giant Ground Sloth. I know you will like it.  oh and by the way it was swell if you like california where they made the film. Bye earthlings. I'm just so excited for my next review. My aliens and earthlings I bid you well. Oh and bye the way i like you. Bye
849,8,"-As of 2020, there are five Ice Age movies, and with the fifth being a failure, it doesn't look like it will continue anytime soon."
850,8,-Nobody should ever have to lay eyes on that monstrosity of a baby.
851,8,-DO NOT let your children watch this terrible movie it truly is an abomination. The Ice Age Baby is maybe the worst thing ever and teaches a terrible messages. Parents should not even watch this they would  probably die.
852,8,-I enjoy this film and think the cgi holds up. Has some violence but overall an enjoyable story that the family can watch. I thought it was good but surprised how big the franchise is now.
853,8,-This movie is one of the best movie I seen on 2001! Its so unique and it really put the message out and what do you do for a family or your friends that you protect them from danger! I think this is a really nice message to this and the movie is so awesome and the best I have seen when I was young!
854,8,"-It's a toddler movie, there's no other way to put it. But the reason for 5 stars is because it's one of them special kids movies that all ages can watch. Be curious with toddlers of 2 or under though, there is some scary scenes."
855,8,-I like this movie. It is about animals adventure.
856,8,"-Sort of cute movie, but Manny is so annoying. It's a pretty cliche movie. Manny reminds me of Calliou and it sounds like his nose is clogged up the whole time... I strongly dislike this movie, but the other ones are ok. Sid is just gross; he makes me naseous, but....MANNY RUINS IT ALL!!!!!!!!!!! Do not watch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
857,8,-okay this was one of the most boringest movies of all time its just so stupid don't watch this stupid movie.I shut it off in the first 30 minutes. don't waste your money or time watching this
858,8,-Title says all
859,8,"-When I saw the trailer,I thought it was boring,but my parents really wanted to watch the movie in theaters,so we went there to watch the movie and let me tell you,it was amazing! I watched it like 3 times now thanks to Netflix. I Like the Animation and story because it just explores your inner emotions,and family. I had a few giggles and laugh but also a little tear at the end. I Highly recommend it to all families World wide! Because it’s my favorite Pixar Movie So far!"
860,8,-Cute with kind and friendly characters!
861,8,"-Some mild swearing (such as “stupid”, “id**t” etc.) and unkindness. One scene involves Riley shouting “shut up” at her parents."
862,8,-Do you really want to teach your childern to get bad habits like swearing when they are angry? Would you want them to learn sexist stereotypes trust me you do not want to watch time movie.
863,8,"-Completely appropriate for almost any age. Beautiful animation, good lesson. I love this movie."
864,8,"-If it is not as good as Toy Story 3 or Lion King, it is a close 3rd or 2nd, this is one of my favorite films. Kids will love the colorful backgrounds and funny humor, and middle and older people will love the powerful messages and jokes. Best Pixar film, you can watch it now!"
865,8,"-I thought it was a good movie: it was fun, funny, and also has a good message that both kids and adults can understand and like, even if the message is deep. One part that parents might want to know about is one of the core memories include a baby's bum being showed with her diaper on her head. It is only shown for a couple seconds as her ""goofball island"" part of herself."
866,8,"-Inside Out is pretty good, but sometimes I just think about it like I do with The Good Dinosaur and think... why? Don’t get me wrong, it is a good movie and had good scenes here and there, but the whole idea of Inside Out is just weird. It is still kind of creative, but I feel like this was the point that Pixar was running out of ideas. It also raises some unanswered questions. The emotions are in peril throughout the movie, but that raises the question: “Can they die? If they die, how would that effect Riley! Bing Bong died, so does that mean the emotions could die.” Another question I thought was near the end. In the end, the mind workers installed a new console for Riley’s teen years. It raised the question: “What happened when they took out Riley’s old console?” That just feels weird and dark. Even though this was Pixar’s “meh”, it’s still better than a LOT of Pixar films. Toy Story, A Bug’s Life, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Toy Story 3, Cars 2 and Monsters University were ALL worse films than Inside Out. Still, Pixar didn’t need to make this. If they were gonna make it, they could’ve at least added more to it. "
867,8,"-I watched this movie and I think it's good, but Bing-Bong (Riley's imaginary friend that is not an emotion) in the movie gets 'forgotten' and at the end and all the Emotions are happy but no-one knows what happens to Bing-Bong and if he's even happy. No-one knows if Joy kept her promise. I think it's quite sad and probably for 9 yrs & up; a bit too sad for small kids. It shows what puberty could be like and it kind of scared me. Also there is talk about using swear words plus there is a bit of puberty stuff. I found that the part when Riley decides to LEAVE HOME (which I found SCARY!) is too much for little kids to process. One last thing is that there is one scene is where toddler Riley shows her bum to everyone who is watching. DON'T SHOW TO LITTLE KIDS!"
868,8,-My brother and I where covering our eyes the entire time!!!
869,8,-Amazing!One of the best MCU movies there are.
870,8,-I love this movie Iron Man is my favorite Marvel character. He is a playboy so there is some suggestive stuff he says but it would probably go over their heads. There is one scene where they are rolling around in bed but nothing is shown and it is quick and skips to morning. There is swearing but not too much for a mature kid. And the violence is not too bad again for a mature kid.
871,8,"-Yeah, there is some violence and me and my older sister did have to skip the part where Tony and Christine are in bed, but I would say it's a great film! Also, I kind of disagree with what Common Sense Media had to say about the bad guys being clearly evil in regards to Obadiah Stane, because at first glance he's a very nice man who cares for and wants to help Tony. Nevertheless, this is a very great movie indeed!"
872,8,-I think that iron man is a good movie but it was kind of boring in the middle. I didn’t see this one first but it was good. Violence was kind of heavy with a few deaths and blood and a shooting. Sex wasn’t much beside the part where the main character has a hookup
873,8,"-Iron Man was a amazing movie! Rdj (Robert Downey Jr) does an amazing turn on iron man. Some innuendo as flirting, bare backs, kissing, and assumed sex. Violence is very realistic with terrorism, kids held at gunpoint, torture among Tony Stark and terrorists. Some alcohol drunken at parties and Tony Stark drinks whiskey very frequently. Tony gambles and flirts at a casino. Iron man’s suit is packed full of tank missiles, lasers, and machine guns. Tony’ best friend betrays him and uses his technology against him. Overall, amazing comic book film with violence and some innuendo"
874,8,"-I personally love this movie. It's not horribly violent, though there are some scenes that I would not recommend a younger kid see. It's funny, too. A great movie to watch if you're new the Marvel universe."
875,8,"-As the first movie in the MCU, this one is a favorite for most. It relies less on CGI and more on true, face-to-face fight scenes. Very stylish. Of course, Robert Downey Jr. is the PERFECT man to play the part. Violence isn't too bad but enough to keep the plot rolling. Humor at it's finest. Language was mild mostly, strong at some parts. Sex was iffy, girls wearing crop-tops and lingerie when drinking with Tony Stark and a few crude statements, nothing that would make your kids questions anything. Tony has a reputation as a playboy. Drinking is recreational and mild, Tony gets drunk (comical but still drunk). A could-be frightening medical scene. I loved this movie and your kids will too!"
876,8,-Parents need to know that iron man is a superhero movie that starts it all the MCU. Like all superhero movies there is definitely some intense violence with lots of punching and high tech machines and gun use. There is also quite a bit of war violence on the other hand. There is one scene around 3-5 seconds of iron man and a random girl making out and implied that they...yeah. Then later appears with barely any clothes. This makes sense later why they put more language and less sexy stuff. Some very mild language including damn one possible a-- and hell. But he is iron man very funny but may be a iffy choice for young kids! Lots of products placements and marvel merchandising!
877,8,"-I watched this movie for the first time just the other day and i anticipated it to be very scary,but i was wrong,the only major bad things are some blood and thats a given with scary movies.Also with the swearing,yes there are kids swearing but my dad told me that kids would swear in the 80s all of the time(which is where its set in).I am very sensitive to scary stuff because of my anxiety and this was ok for me,so just dont watch it if you are a sensitive person."
878,8,"-Right off the bat I'm going to say that I say 13+ because I watched with friends. My review would probably be different if I watched it alone. I found it kind of scary, but being with my friends made it easier. If I were alone I'd probably be making this 14+ or something. The story is so good, and the casting is amazing. Eddie is a sweetheart, Ritchie is a king, Beverly is a queen and Bill is sweetie-pie. Mike and the other dude are kind of lame. It's much less inappropriate than the book. I totally recommend.  This was one of my first horror movies, and boy, was it a great one."
879,8,"-This review has no spoilers. This movie was great and as a horror fan it was even better. I didnt put spoilers in this because i definitely suggest you watch this movie for yourself. Its funny, scary (kinda), suspensful, and overall enjoyable. If your over ten and you dont mind scares, this is the movie for you."
880,8,"-I was wreally swary I took my 2 year old to see it and they said ""Best movie EVER"". Favourite character was for sure the gay kid, he was INSPIWING!"
881,8,-I watched it when I was 11 I thought it was pretty good if your child is scared easily id wait a few years. I love the movie and watch it quite often. Pennywise is a bit creepy for people who do not like clowns. But I would still recommend! If you have not watched already I would watch the only part that I wouldn’t want little kids to see is when one of the bully’s stabs his dad in the neck after pennywise tells him too.
882,8,"-If you say “it's not scary”, okay, you're fine! I hated this movie; rude characters, young teens say swear words, Georgie's arm was bitten by Pennywise, and a abusing teen girl named Beverley. Pennywise is an Alien dressed up as a clown, not his species is a clown. Imagine that ‘It’ was a Sci-Fi horror movie. These clowns are creepy (or not too creepy)! Not for school people. These creators don't know when they can allowed to say swear words. I thought it was PG-13 but it's R. It has tons of blood and gore. I love Halloween but this was so trash! If you love this movie, then shame on you! Just stop loving this movie! Maybe Rebecca Spark will probably hate this!"
883,8,"-Honestly, I don’t know who would want to watch such movies. The creepy Halloween decorations they have out in the stores scares ME a little still but, I’m just a sensitive teen!"
884,8,-The origonal IT is ok for kids but not the new one because  it to violent there you go dudes
885,8,"-yes , IT wouldn't be the best movie to pick if your afraid of clowns, but if your not I think IT would be perfect! the movie is about 7 outcasts who got bullied previously , fighting this bully but then one of there brothers (Georgie denbrough , bills brother) goes missing ( taken from pennywise) the 7 losers go out searching for Georgie and fighting pennywise. the contest behind the movie is to be who you want to be and know that you dont have to be popular to be the star , I will say throughout the movie there is a lot of language and talk on health, and there isn't a lot of blood , the movie has the perfect amount of horror and comedy , I personally love the film with a passion."
886,8,-This movie is great except for the language I think that’s why they rated it R. Violence is like in a superhero movie and the little bit of sexual content is supposed to be comical.
887,8,"-I've seen some kids/teens say it's one of the worst movies. Okay, I can respect that! Holly R says this movie is just creepy!"
888,8,"-These reviews you see around you are by a bunch of snowflakes who can't take anything slightly scary. For me, this is a classic I've loved since I was 4 and something that families will be happily watching together. Everything is great from the visuals, the character design, the stop-motion animation, the simple but fun songs, and great messages of family, friendship, and conquering your fears. This movie managed to elevate and expand upon the original book that I'll always see this as the definitive version of the story. Same with director Selick's other triumphant classics of 'Coraline' and 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'."
889,8,-This movie was terrible It was so boring.
890,8,"-It’s on the older side of animation but overall and funny movie, great for kids 8+. This movies does contain the word ass but that’s about it for language. Can scare young or sensitive children. Very little sexual references; the centipede flirts with the spider repetitively, there is also a scene where the cricket asks the centipede it’s longitude and latitude, but the centipede mistakes the question as asking him the size of his… y’know. The centipede replies to the cricket with “that’s very personality information”"
891,8,-I've loved this movie since I saw it when I was 8.
892,8,"-I like this movie but I don't think it is appropriate for kids 9-, because the aunts try to kill James with an axe and they also abuse him."
893,8,"-As a Tim Burton fan i think the movie was awsome, a piece of art. "
894,8,"-Okay, so first let me say: the book is AMAZING. Fun, heartwarming and just weird enough to be memorable. The movie though...ugh. First, the beginning is TERRIFYING. I wasn't allowed to watch this when I was little, and I see why. I mean, a giant rhinoceros appears from the sky and basically murders a kid's parents, leaving him in the hands of his abusive and repulsive aunts. Family entertainment at it's best. And the rest of the movie just doesn't make sense. I fell asleep partway through, and when I woke up they were...in space? And yet I honestly don't feel like I missed out on much. Even the songs are weird, somewhat tuneless, and add nothing to the plot. I USUALLY love Tim Burton movies, but this one was just a disappointment. I only gave it that extra star because the grasshopper, glow worm and centipede are hilarious and add just a little whimsy to an otherwise unsettling and skippable movie."
895,8,-A great movie but the Aunts are really mean and we don't like that bit but I know that it's only for he movie and they aren't like that in real life and they are just acting. I really like when James is in the peach and having the adventures.
896,8,"-This movie was great.  I would have to say that the bugs aren't really creepy, but that's just my opinion.  The movie was an interesting kind of weird.  My brother, who is 6, says the movie was good and actiony."
897,8,"-this movie is not scary. I heard that some people were afraid to have a BATH after this movie, what???  there is only a little blood and the scariest thing was hoping my mom would not come in on those parts."
898,8,"-So many parents who watched it in ‘their day.’ Talk this movie up so much. It is not scary and I think a baby could handle this. But some things to realise is that their are complete idiots in this movie, and I know people allergic to jerks. (If you thought that was real, you shouldn’t be thinking about watching jaws.)"
899,8,"-Jaws, although being old is very scary. There are TONS of graphic shark attacks including a man being eaten alive while he screams in agne and spits up blood. There is also a scene where a sunken boat is found and a dead mans head appears without an eye. Although it isn’t that realistic it is incredibly disturbing. The first scene also shows a girl getting naked and then jumping into the water. Jaws is violent but one of the best movies I have ever seen."
900,8,"-This was a fantastic movie! I'm not a fan of anything bloody, but I really did enjoy watching it! I think you should wait until 11 or 12 depending on what you can handle. The first scene in the movie is a girl who is attacked by a shark, and then a child does which is really sad, and we do see some remains of a shark victim that is disturbing, dead people, and a really disturbing scene of a man tragically be torn to bits by a shark on a boat, but other than these things, it isn't too horrible. A few jump scares, but nothing sexual or to harsh. I just think parents should watch with their children but other than that, a pretty good movie!"
901,8,"-I think Jaws is a really good movie to watch with family. It can be a little scary at times but it is over all not that scary. There is not that much gore or very graphic deaths. I think it is a great movie, but if your kid is more scared of the ocean and sharks then I would say this movie is not for them."
902,8,-This movie's special effects are amazing. The first time I watched this movie I didn't really know what to expect but I actually thought that everything in the movie could've actually happened. This movie does show blood and people by the shark though the blood is basically only in the water. The movie also shows the characters drinking.  I think this movie should probably be watched by 12+ because there are a lot of kids who aren't exposed to certain things like drinking till they're older. Over all I think this is an amazing movie 10/10 would recommend.
903,8,"-Jaws is an excellent shark film but be aware there is blood, violence, and smoking. This classic movie does not disappoint as Steven Spielberg movies never do! There are a few bloody attack moments but not all shark attacks show blood, as well as some few intense jump scare moments that may be to intense for younger viewers. Overall it's a great movie to watch."
904,8,"-This is a GREAT classic film. This film (In my opinion) Is suitable for kids 11 and up. There is some blood and gore, but otherwise, it should be just fine as long as your kids don't get frightened too easily."
905,8,-Great horror movie about the hunt for a deadly great white shark.
906,8,-This an amazing movie and I really do think anyone who is mature
907,8,"-Jurassic Park is a movie about an island that is inhabited by dinosaurs that are kept in cages and enclosures. The dinosaurs were brought back by dna found in a bug that was encased in amber. The park gets visitors and during this tour the power gets cut and dinosaurs go rampant, taking over the park and killing scientists and tourists. Alan is one of these tourists and he starts using his skillset to keep two children alive while they fight to get the dinosaurs back in containment."
908,8,-I think this movie is great and that the dinosaurs are done really well. There is a lot of action and a few bloody scenes but nothing that bad.
909,8,"-This is a great movie! It might be a little scary at points, but that just adds to the suspense, action, and terror! Some violent areas, like a man getting eaten off a toilet, and a severed arm on a woman's shoulder. Overall a GREAT movie though! Hope you enjoy!!"
910,8,-jurassic park is a movie that has dinosaurs in a park that shows what they look like and how they act but they get fre and take over the island.
911,8,"-Where do I even begin? It’s amazing. The plot is amazingly original, the characters are very enjoyable, and than there’s the action. Where do I begin? The Dinosaurs look AMAZING, and the action is excellent, creative and amazingly exciting. The acting is spectacular. I can’t even put it into words how good the actors did. Flawless."
912,8,-Must see I bet you parents seen this but you are not sure for kids well easy there is chomping the main bad guy (Denis) died not at the end you think the T-Rex is bad but you relies the t-Rex is good and saves the day by eating 4 raptors and the best / classic WHEN DINOS ROARED THE  EARTH banner falls when the t-Rex roars. A car chase happens and just to say it’s a exiting scary story that will fill any body up with exiting action even if you hate dinosaurs as you they roared the earth once and not fully a dinosaur movie
913,8,"-I’v seen both Jurassic Park and Jaws,(I personally think JAWS is a little bit better,) and like both of them. It is intense, with some body parts falling off, but fine for kids 10+."
914,8,"-This movie is one of works of the legendary director Stephen Spielberg and special effects designer Stan Winston, the made behind the Terminator, Jaws, Edward Scissorhands, and many more. The movie was released to the world in 1993. Based on the novel by Michael Crichton published in 1990, this movie is a watch for the whole family. It was filmed in Kauai, one of the Hawaiian Islands."
915,8,-I loved this movie had violence but not so bad and langauge and drinking and smoking and a half naked girl in her bra and panties
916,8,-This is a very entertaining movie as well scary but not that scary. I really enjoyed this movie my 7 year old sister was a bit scared at some points but I think it's fine. I personally think 9+ is a
917,8,"-Jurassic Park is about a theme park full of dinosaurs. Before it can go public, it needs to be proven safe by a lawyer, a mathematician and 2 dinosaur experts. The grandkids of the park's creator also tag along for the ride. And, as you might expect, everything goes wrong..."
918,8,"-I watched this movie when I was 7 and it was fine. If your trying to find a movie to watch with your family, pick this! Only part that may be frightening for young children is when the t-Rex eats the guy off a toilet LOL"
919,8,-I think this movie should have been rated M or PG 13 cause some scenes may be a bit scary. Also towards the end it swung to close to the horror genre.
920,8,"-Jurassic Park is a movie classic with peril and slim to none gory violence. The story is about archaeologists that get a opportunity to work at a dinosaur theme park, but when a monsoon rolls into the island, the dinosaurs in habitat escape. Lots of dinosaur jump scares, but most kids and pre teens would be able to handle it. Characters use tranquilizer guns as well as machine guns. Dink’s kill each other and humans through biting, venom/ saliva spit, and pouncing onto humans/ dinos. A character loses a arm and scares a main character, which could be scary to younger kids. Kids get electrocuted and are in peril through the movie. Mild cursing such as “son of a b*tch”, sh*t, and damn. Overall, great movie that older Kids and pre teens will love."
921,8,"-the is a brilliant movie, but also good for younger kids because it could never happen in real life. highly reccomended as long as your kid is not too sensitive. there are positive adult role models. enjoy."
922,8,-Great movie but not for young children
923,8,"-The Movie includes alot of sci-fi violence. There are scenes where dinosaurs kill people but it is not gory. Also some language (Samuel L. Jackson), so it is not for small ones. Great for 10-15 year old."
924,8,-Parents need to know that this amazing film by Steven Spielberg is amazing. There is definitely lots of violence some of it quite gruesome involving a severed arm. Lots of terror as well and some language including a few S--T and hell's and damns and more. Positive role models and messages and helping them from dying of course and some product placements and of screen merchandising.
925,8,-The classic Jurassic Park is a great movie with some fake animal violence.
926,8,"-Jurassic park is a good movie with some blood, children in constant peril, and realistic dinosaurs. Overall fine for tweens."
927,8,-Astounding film filled with epic and memorable scenes. A great first PG-13 film for kids.
928,8,"-Jurassic Park is the ultimate combination of great acting, terrific special effects, and a script that really couldn’t get any greater than it is. Since that script is about dinosaurs eating people, it can be a very intense movie for some. I wouldn’t call it scary, as there isn’t more than one true “jumpscare”, but the rest of the intense scenes are played out very realistically with a real sense of grittiness and peril. The most brutal scene involves a man getting eaten whole by a T.rex, but as with all the other scenes there’s not much blood. Language never goes too vulgar (goddamn son of b*tch, hell, one big pile of sh*t, etc.), and even at that it’s few and far inbetween."
929,8,"-All the Jurassic Park movies are amazing, but this one is by far the best. Older tweens and teens should be able to handle it. The dinosaurs are very realistic and might scare some younger kids, but if they can handle scary things, then they should be fine. There's a lot of violence, most if it isn't too bloody, but it can still get a bit gruesome. The swearing is pretty mild for a PG-13 movie, at least, compared to more recent PG-13 movies, it is. The swearing is mostly hell and damn, with sh*t in there once or twice, as well as religious profanity like oh my God, etc. As long as kids know that dinosaurs aren't real and scientists aren't going to bring them back, they should be fine."
930,8,"-Whoever cab87670 is, They are a liar!"
931,8,"-This movie was the best, but I don't think anyone under 14 should watch it, it has some blood and gore, lots of violence, swearing, and frightening scenes, we also see a bloody animal leg land on a car. It's not your average dinosaur movie. But for 14 and up, it's awesome!"
932,8,"-great classic spielberg film, violence may disturb younger audiences, and the swearing is a little much."
933,8,-I watched it with my papaw and i thought it was really good! One of my favorite movies overall. The parts i would look into was that When the goat was gone A bloody leg/arm of a goat landed on the car. The second part is when The girl goes to the shack to get the power to come back on she runs because the raptor chases her and mr arnolds arm slides out on her shoulder she walks forwards and its his arm that had been bit off and was very bloody. they say a few cuss words like 2 or three they say sh and bi.
934,8,"-This is a spectacular movie!!!!!  The special effects of this movie are astounding and the dinosaurs are extremely realistic.  the first thirty or forty minutes of this movie are mostly touring the park, which some kids may find boring and want to stop the movie.  But make sure they stick with it  because this movie turns into a fantastic thrill ride with suspense aplenty.  In this classic thriller, characters are almost always in danger.  People are killed in this movie but most of the violence is not bloody, in fact most of the deaths are not even fully shown.  Only for or five people die in the entire movie.  There are only two slightly violent scenes in which a goat's leg is thrown on a window by a dinosaur and when a decapitated (and rather fake looking) arm is grabbed by a character (which she drops almost immediately and is not shown again).  Some blood is shown but it is mostly just scrapes and cuts on the people who survive.  Language is scarce and I thought that this film was not scary at all, but younger viewers may disagree.  Overall, I would say that this movie is a great family film and you only might want to preview it  for extremely young and sensitive children."
935,8,"-Jurassic Park is a classic, fun film for older kids. This film brings awe and wonder with it's nice use of animatronic and CGI dinosaurs, but with that, brings terror and violet imagery. Even as  a mostly blood and gore-less film, expect character deaths from dinos big and small. While most deaths aren't graphic or are done off screen, there is one main exception with a scene involving a large dino that 'jumpscares' you and a severed arm landing on another character. Even with the lack of extreme violence, it's still an intense movie, involved peril and pursuit throughout.  Sexual content is limited, with the main one being a woman in a bikini on one of the staff member's computers. Language is moderate, with usual curses and 1-2 uses of the word, ""s**t."" Overall, you really have to know your kid. Some kids may be fine with the violence, but think it's too scary. Others might not like some of the mildly-intense death scenes. I recommend you give it a viewing before letting your kid see it."
936,8,-This is truly one of the greatest movies ever although the violence is high there a severed arm shown and some swearing to also people are eaten and a mans face is eaten off screen but you see the raptor on the guy getting eaten a man is eaten off of a toilet and a bloody leg is shown but overall its a must see movie!
937,8,"-This movie is definitely strong at some points and weak at others. I felt like in the first act of the movie was dull, boring, horribly written and not well acted, but the second act was absolutely great! It had amazing peril and just what i was looking for out of this movie, but act three didn’t get off that lucky because it gets worse by a bit but overall definitely a movie people should see."
938,8,"-Really, nothing to worry about. I watched it when I was six I was more fascinated then frightened. Parents, It's good to let kids watch cool, sci-fi violence and know a good movie to recommend and discuss with friends! It's actually imagination-building, and not letting them watch movies can leave them very behind when they're older! Not appropriate for moms,though.  My friend's parents wouldn't let her watch Harry Potter when she was younger, and now she's so set back on all the new action movies everyone's talking about at school, and very depressed about it!"
939,8,"-The movie Jurassic Park is about an island/amusement park with  living dinosaurs. This movie is a classic/action/science fiction movie. The movie centers around two paleontologist that are asked to come see the park by its founder and creator. This movie is about dinosaurs that look very realistic, this could be frightening for younger viewers. Characters swear  frequently throughout, and one main character smokes throughout the movie. Overall this is a very exciting and well made film. I think it would be great for 13 and up depending on the maturity of the 13 year old."
940,8,"-Good film, but definitely not for little children - I tried to show it to my 6 year old brother and he got bored at the start. Then I remembered the about the dinosaurs, and turned it off.  Not that scary, but you need a good attention span to pay attention te some of the dialogue at the start.  It is not a 12+ or it would be a 12 on the box; I watched this when I was 10 and that was a good age. It's a PG."
941,8,"-I watched this movie a year or two ago, and I still love it to today. This movie is pretty fake, but worth watching. The dinosaurs- I have an exception for the incredibly realistic giants that are the main reason of this movie."
942,8,-theres some swearing like sh*t crap hell  damn son of a b*ch   dodam  and some blood people shooting dinosaurs  and dinosaurs eating humans
943,8,"-I watched this with my aunt who is all about girl power and the strength of women. I was visiting her once and when we went to a movie store I found this movie and I have really wanted to see it, It was her first time watching Miyazaki and thought it was wonderful. Kiki goes off on her own to live as a young witch and work to help the new community she lives in. Even though it was hard she works hard and tries to do the right thing to benefit everyone. This is probably the best Miyazaki for girls."
944,8,-everyone can what it. not scary except at the end (for little ones) no sexy stuff no swearing other than a few insults. great movie. no drinking drugs or smoking .
945,8,-i thought it was really cool to watch especially if your in the UK and can't get your hands on this DVD...anyway if you like cartoons and a bit of flying magic you will definitely enjoy this! it's one of my favourite DVD's please watch it
946,8,"-This is an awesome movie for all ages. It is a very entertaining movie to watch with a good story about a young witch trying to discover who she is. There is no violence or swearing, there are some suspenseful moments when Kiki is on her broom stick but nothing scary that will keep kids up at night. It has many good lessons about helping others and being yourself also many good role models. It is still fun to watch for older kids so if your family has older kids and younger kids this is an awesome movie to watch."
947,8,"-Well, I couldn't have predicted this! After the unabashed feebleness of My Neighbor Totoro, I can't say that I was too hyped to watch Kiki's Delivery Service. But out of the clear blue sky, I've found a Miyazaki movie that I like even more than Princess Mononoke! It shocked me as well. Kiki's Delivery Service doesn't share Princess Mononoke's grander or epic story telling. But then again, it doesn't collapse around itself in the third act (Mononoke's main problem). The final product is so very whimsical, I couldn't help but grin the entire way through!"
948,8,-awesome educational movie
949,8,"-I was actually hesitant to watch this movie, but it did not disappoint. It was very fun and beautifully done. I love how Studio Ghibli always makes it feel like you're in that time. One of my favorite scenes was when Kiki and Tombo ride the bike together, very cute. Good scenery animation as usual."
950,8,-People always say That if I Was Any Movie Character I'd Be Kiki. This Movie Is The 4th Miyazaki Film I Have Ever Seen (Out of 9) and It So Edge of Your Seat and The Animation is Breathtaking I Think Kiki's Delivery Service is One of The Top 30 Best Movies Ever Made.
951,8,"-My family and I loved this movie! Kiki's so sweet, and the same goes for Osono and Jiji! This has to be one of my favorite studio ghibli movies."
952,8,-I love this movie!
953,8,-Great movie love the mystery and comedy. This movie is one of my favorites but it has a little too much language that didn’t need to be in the movie.
954,8,"-Very entertaining, with a great cast and plot. It's a bit slow at times but the plot twists and ending make up for it. "
955,8,"-Context: when I walk into a movie theater, I automatically have a negative opinion on the movie. This had gotten to the point where I wasn't sure if this was a good strategy, as there was always SOMETHING that made me dislike a movie.  And then... there was Knives Out. "
956,8,"-This movie is a murder mystery film, it has violence and some cussing. However the characters are well-rounded and clever this is a very good murder mystery movie that is a must watch if you like comedy and thrillers."
957,8,"-I personally love this movie. I think most kids in 6th grade and up should see it. The cast is phenomenal. It's not surprising, but the story line is. "
958,8,"-I LOVED the movie, my parents and I saw a ad and we just had to watch it, I wasn't very surprised when they said who it was ( Your welcome for not spoiling) but I think everyone knew who ACTUALLY killed him, kind of obvious."
959,8,-Plot: Google it yourself :)
960,8,-cool movie an excellent mystery followed by excellent acting Daniel Craig and Chris Evans.A fascinating funny mystery.It's cool and epic and for sure a must watch.
961,8,-This movie is great fun and great everyone over 11!
962,8,"-This movie is sooo goood! It’s so funny but you always are wondering what happened and how did the detective know? But parents need to know that there is: an affair, medication/drugs, a tiny bit of violence and scariness, smoking, drinking, a tiny bit of blood,etc. this movie is good but for kids who can handle that and kids who can handle that only! For ages 14+ shouldn’t have to be mature."
963,6,"-I loved this movie. One of the best of the year. The animation, of course, is gorgeous and flawless, the voice acting is great, the action sequences were exciting and surprisingly brutal, the score is beautiful and the storytelling is amazing, with the main character telling stories with origami. The 3D is unnecessary. Grade: A+."
964,6,"-Impeccable and majestic beauty; Laika is already a strengthened production studio of distinguished films that combine traditional animation with a reserved use of digital technology, obtaining an air more craft and realistic, technique present in feature films such as the gloomy ""Coraline"" or the terrifying ""ParaNorman"", Laika has established a great fortitude and prestige in a world in where Pixar prevails year after year; ""Kubo and The Two Strings"" consolidates the essence of prior all films of the studio while adding something extra courtesy of a timeless visual and narrative magnificence, an eloquent feat of 2016 and openly a direct nominated to The Academy Awards."
965,6,"-Kubo is one of the best films I have seen in a long time, and I have no doubt it will be nominated for an Oscar, much less win. The visuals are absolutely stunning, a mix of stop-motion and animation that creates a visual masterpiece. The story and plot are complex and is told in quite a beautiful way. That being said, it is a very dark tale right from the beginning, with many deaths (one very unexpected and sad one), many, many scenes of peril and VERY intense violence, with blood and injuries. Many scenes have very creepy ambiance and tone. The language is pretty tame, although there is one use of the word ""hell"", in reference to how humans live compared to how another character does. I would say this is for about kids 10+, who can handle it. My sensitive 10 year-old brother had nightmares, but there were other other younger children who did just fine. However, don't let that shy you away from this stunning film, as it is also pretty funny and sweet, and has a great message about family and love. For more mature audience, this is an absolute must-see."
966,6,-This is now my favourite movie!
967,6,"-This was a great fantastical movie. It’s about a young boy named Kubo, who has a mysterious power to make paper shape into little creatures when he plays his shamisen (guitar-like instrument.)"
968,6,"-In a year of talking animated animal movies, Kubo may be far one of the best next to Zootopia. While Kubo isn't exactly a talking animal film (Other than a beetle and a monkey), this strange stop motion piece of art is really neat and beautifully done. "
969,6,-It is great and I loved it. Something I've never seen before but doesn't stray too far away from normal. Good lure and original story.
970,6,"-I have to say that the visual affects on this movie is spectacular and good. But on the down side, this movie could have been better and not so forced pushed in the end, their were some parts that were spiritual in a way also. and also there is a lot of violence for a PG movie. :/"
971,6,"-It was cute, but the childish characters and the boring slow pace ruined it for me. Also, it does get a bit too disturbing but not too depressing."
972,6,-Scary
973,8,"-This is not some nice snowy film with an adventure. It's some depressing story you don't want to watch and doesn't make you feel inspired, either."
974,8,"-So, if you are hoping for an uplifting snowy adventure, NO this is NOT what you are looking for at all. It is so depressing, it is too long, uneventful. So half of the movie she has done nothing except be in her town, she is a mentally ill lady who goes into the wilderness to find treasure from Fargo the movie, lets down kindness twice, throws her rabbit on a train, spitting into her boss' tea, stole his credit card, A TERRIBLE MOVIE,  and then..."
975,8,-My rating:PG for mature scenes.
976,8,"-Before I say what I'm about to say, this movie is awesome. The music is great, humor is great, character development, it's just great! There isn't any concerning violence, and other content stays within the PG range. Now that I've said all of that, I'm going to say what caused me problems when I first watched this. Part of the plot has to do with Po's past and what happened to his mother, and all of that made me cry. But not during the movie, but several weeks after. I would literally cry myself to sleep with my mom at my bedside to try to sooth me. In other words, be aware of your child's sensitivity when considering this movie. I'm okay now, and I think the movie is great."
977,8,-This movie has a little bit more violence and the message is mildly worse. but the movie is my favorite of the 3.
978,8,-Awesome. I think kids aged 6 and up will love this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
979,8,"-I saw this in theaters years ago,and I wil say,it's awesome. Just like the 1st movie,it has a good message,and has great humor. Really worth watching overall."
980,8,"-Out of all the Kung Fu Panda movies, this one is, without a doubt, my favorite, and it has always been that way."
981,8,"-I loved Kung fu panda...so why not watch the second one, it was a really good sequel...it is a little  Violence....but who cares it was AMAZING it gets you into the Kung fun spirt...so grab a pillow watch the series...."
982,8,"-This movie has a deep message that all people should remember: no matter what your past is, you can choose who you are now. The animation is done very well. Very funny and a beautifully written script. It is centered around Po (the panda) trying to discover his past so he can find peace. It is inspiring when he finds peace even when he knows Shen was responsible for the killing of his parents. It’s a must watch for families. However if your child is adopted you should consider sitting with them while the movie plays because it shows Po’s parents abandoning him and this may negatively affect your adopted child."
983,8,-A bird uses lots of gunpower
984,6,-This movie had such a rich and powerful message it brought me to tears by the ending credits. It was by far the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. The music really contributed to the overall feel of the movie. I definitely recommend this movie.
985,6,"-So, I'm 13, and I personally loved this movie. My 7yr old sister came in my room and turned on this movie. I was doing homework but ended up sitting down and watching it with her. I actually think I enjoyed it more that my sister. There is a bar scene but there is no blatant drunkenness, the main plot of the scene is to show  Felici dancing. The movie emphasizes hard work, and the importance of forgiving others. I give this a 10 out of 10, a must see."
986,6,"-I saw this movie with a bunch of other teenage girls. We predicted every plot twist and laughed at the cheesy dialogue, but that's what made it good. It is definitely unrealistic and silly from many aspects, but you have to accept that and enjoy it for what it is. One of the last scenes was a bit scary for little kids. Camille's mother is chasing Felicie with a giant hammer. It would be scary for a young child, but other than that, it is a pretty safe movie. The messages are good. The protagonist makes mistakes, must own up to them, and over comes them. Overall, this was a good movie."
987,6,-Makes me want to jump off the roof. Great family-friendly adventure for 6 years olds. Some scary parts though. LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Role models are GREAT!
988,6,-Great movie for everyone
989,6,"-I watched this movie in the theatre and I loved it! It is a lovely film that mostly follows Felicie on her journey to become a Ballerina. Although the movie glosses over some of the time it took for her to become a ballerina, we don't actually know how long it skipped as she practiced, all we got was a rehearsal and practice montage and I thought it worked really well! I would be able to watch it so many more times and not get tired of it. Also, with the homocidal mom, my mom told me that in Japan it is so competitive to get your kids into a good preschool that some moms have actually killed other kids. So in a way, the movie mom kind of makes sense, because she believe's Camille's future is ruined. Great Movie!"
990,6,"-I first saw this movie on a plane! It was called Ballerina. I liked it so much I saw it 3 more times! It inspired me to join Ballet classes and I'm really enjoying them. The movie  has great messages and role models. It has very little violence, and nothing inappropriate for kids! It is definitely a very good family movie!"
991,6,"-I would say that it’s good for anyone.  But the boy is more of a backup character.  And if there are people who mostly want movies about boy inventors, then I wouldn’t suggest this."
992,6,"-Good for boys and girls,  I liked it "
993,8,"-This movie is all about how a band comes together and becomes famous all from getting into detention (dont go to detention kids even though you could end up being famous like these guys but that is highly unlikely, sorry to burst your bubble) anyway the songs are so good and its a BOP. There is nothing bad but it does include language- they speak english but I bet theres versions in different languages tooo."
994,8,-Probably the best Disney Channel movie ever
995,8,"-it has everything singing,  craziness, silliness, and makes you happy"
996,8,"-I would say this movie wasn't amazing, but it's better than any other Disney Channel movie. A lot of the other movies often star a cheerful but annoying tween who has practically no social skills, plus almost any main guy character in those movies is almost purely a love interest. "
997,8,"-I absolutely ADORE this movie and I am almost 15 years old. It's AMAZING and filled with great messages, great music, and great role models. There is a little bit of romance although I wouldn't exactly call it that. (I have no other word.) One of the main characters has a boyfriend, and she kisses his cheek, but there is no lip on lip kissing. She later finds her boyfriend with another girl who's wearing his jacket and touching his bicep. Another main character tells a girl that he likes her, but it's no big deal. "
998,8,"-What can I say? This movie, when I watched it, seemed perfect. Despite being G-PG rated (different sources say different ratings) they didn't hold back from adding emotional and tougher scenes, which now that I'm older, I enjoy more and more. As much as I loved it now, I don't know if I would have loved it as much if I were younger. I recommend it for kids eleven and up, although it's great for a movie night with the entire family :)"
999,8,"-This movie, in my opinion, is really cheesy and is not worth watching. I mean, in one scene, out of the clear blue sky, everyone starts playing  a song when they just meet, as if they have been practicing for YEARS. And in another, before they're first performance, a main character Olivia, is feeling nervous, and then, as if it will make the world perfect, one of her band mates passes her some lemonade, and then, POOF! Everyone can move on with their wonderful lives. Some of the music was kind of good, but in my opinion, not good enough to make up for the unrealistic story line ."
1000,8,-Really good
1001,8,-It is a really good movie with lots of cool songs. I haven't seen it in a few years but I still remember Determinate. Also it has a lot of good messages such as defend your friends from bullies and stand up for what you believe in.
1002,7,-This Is a very nice movie. Love the teamwork and the action. It is a little funny but it is a family movie.
1003,7,"-This is a fun space movie. I have a couple qualms about it, however. The movie’s intro notes that the movie in from 1995, but, ironically, it’s the best animated Pixar film to date in my mind. Secondarily (and this is not the movie’s fault) people have been interpreting the scene where there is a same-sex kiss as a heavily sexualized scene, but this is not true. The characters kiss for 0.2 seconds and it’s edited out in the Disney+ version. Additionally, people seem to not care whether or not straight couples kiss in movies, so I don’t see the big deal. The movie has a great cast of voices, featuring Chris Evans as Buzz (doing an OK job replacing Tim Allen), James Brolin as a redesign of Zurg (Buzz’s enemy from Toy Story 2), Keke Palmer as Izzy Hawthorne, the grandchild of Buzz’s friend Alisha, and Taika Watiti as Mo Morisson, a hapless space recruit. In terms of violence, the movie is okay, in the opening scenes there are vine aliens which spray green blood when attacked with a lightsaber-esque weapon. Zurg’s robots are semi-violent. There are carnivore bugs which attempt to eat Buzz in one scene. Several aliens are electrified on a “laser shield” but this is not really violent and mainly used for comedic relief. Zurg has a dangerous mech suit which shoots lasers at Buzz and grabs him with a large grappling hook. Zurg also has an evil version of Buzz’s robot Sox which appears to be melty and is kind of gross. Zurg’s backstory is kind of sad, as he (SPOILERS) is an old version of Buzz who was abused by the various military commanders and went on too many time travel missions, causing his friends to pass away and give him the idea he forced them away. A character is often captured by the previously mentioned sentient vines but is shown to escape, another is presumably killed by the vines. There are some strange scenes involving scientific depictions of time travel which may confuse younger kids. Explosions are shown, but often in a stereotypical manner. Buzz is slightly abused by a military commander who seeks to exploit his skills. Buzz steals a ship from a space headquarters to save the planet, but this may be interpreted as flat-out criminal activity by your children. It’s a pretty okay movie for kids 8 and up, and it comes with a cute robot cat, so who couldn’t resist?"
1004,7,"-They worked too hard on the animation and not hard enough on the story. For most of the movie, he just tries and fails to get back to his home planet. And then he gives up in the end. The End. Blah. The animation is pretty good though! But other than that, blah."
1005,7,-The whole movie had an objective and they didn't even achieve that objective. Started out strong but got weaker and weaker.
1006,7,"-This is an amazing movie. I found it funny and action-packed. Sox carried the whole movie. The only reason people said it was ""inappropriate"" is because there was a 0.2 second same sex kiss (That was cut on Disney+)"
1007,7,-I is so good buzz lightyear has a amazing adventure throw space it is a family film and you can learn a lot about space from this film which is why I rated this film 5 stars.
1008,7,"-Don't know what the fuss is all about. Great film, my 8-year-old was a bit confused with the plot, that's why I put 9 and older"
1009,8,"-If you enjoy 00's Disney films, this is a great pick for you. Has many nostalgic elements from many childhoods. I recommend this for ages 6 and up because some scenes can be frightening for younger viewers. Great film!"
1010,8,"-So I’m a teen mom with a 2 year old running around my house, I watched this movie when I was a kid and I personally think it’s a good movie for kids around 5 maybe even younger with their parents around. It is important that they know its not ok to talk to strangers and it’s not ok to fight, but this movie is something for the kids and parents to sit and watch WITH THEM. My little girl can learn values from the movie like family strength."
1011,8,"-I changed my mind. I really love Lilo & Stitch because they're so cool! But they're sister Hona is rude and bossy. But she's okay. The Music is Amazing, The Opening was Fantastic, The Animation is Awesome, And The Characters are very funny! I saw this movie when I was a little kid. And I liked it. I laughed at the funny parts of this hilarious and action packed movie!! This movie is very funny for kids 5 and up!"
1012,8,"-I have this movie on DVD and think its really touching, it teaches kids that sometimes in life, things might not always go the way you planned them. it also teaches to respect people for who they are, even if there an alien. I also love the connection between stitch and lilo in this movie. the bit were stitch leaves because he feels like he doesn't feel right in lilos world made me cry. really good movie."
1013,8,-Some rude words like stupidhead and butt but I think it's good for 6 and up. Some violence but I thought it was great! 4 and a half stars!
1014,8,"-Most of the reviews here seem to swing dramatically one way or the other. Taken for what it is, it's a great movie. It's funny, sweet, a bit of a tearjerker, and I just love the round, comfortable-looking character design! Pretty much every character is likable too, even the antagonistic ones are trying to do the right thing."
1015,8,-i love ohana means family and family means no one gets left behind or forgotten and its such a cute movie
1016,8,-It's good for kids like me yes.
1017,8,"-This movie has cute characters, many positive role models, and laughs."
1018,8,-I think it is a good  comedy for kids 6+. Sometimes they yell .  There  also a war scene  with shooting cannons and guns. You  should watch this film right now!!!!!
1019,4,"-I'm not exaggerating, this movie is GORGEOUS. But it might scare or depress little kids. Ex. the graphic and very realistic storm at sea, giant octopus rises from the water (and turns out to be a freind!) My sister was scared of the octopus. And tears exploded from her eyes in an emotonal storm when the boy was looking for the penguin. GREAT movie, would watch any time. 3 stars, left out two for the sadness, scariness."
1020,4,"-Nothing is scary in this movie. There were really adorable characters that treat each other sweetly. I love that penguin! The octopus looked scary for 1 minute, but they were sleeping on the bottom of the boat and the octopus helped them because he was great."
1021,8,"-If your ideal movie is a terrible story that has no plot, action, or conflict, I would recommend this one to you for sure. There is nothing bad in the movie, a toddler could watch it. The movie is just not good. It's boring as hell."
1022,8,"-I love the Beach Boys (but not Mike Love). And this biopic kinda missed the mark for me. The 60s scenes were so enjoyable, the 90s not so much. If it had been only the 60s I probably would’ve liked it more, although I understand the importance of Brian Wilson’s life in the 90s. So, this is worth a watch. For half of it, at least."
1023,8,-This film is absolutely amazing and very different. This movie contains some language especially in one scene and a lot of pot use. There are also some very intense scenes when Brian is having panic attacks and hallucinating. But I highly recommend this film
1024,8,"-My rating:PG-13 for racy references,some language,and drug use throughout."
1025,5,-This film has some scary moments but kids will still enjoy and is a positive movie
1026,5,"-I am 11 years old, watched it with my father and my 6 year old brother."
1027,5,-yes
1028,5,"-Educational, a lot of positive messages such as don't be overprotective parent, looks doesn't matter - what you do does, teams can do everything, follow your dreams...."
1029,5,-It was a pretty good movie. I had low expectations so I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was better than I thought it was going to be. It has really good meaning and the music is excellent.
1030,5,"-I watched this with my mom and sister, it was good! I liked the part when Luca's uncle comes over it's really funny! Some of the fishing supplies (Knives, hooks, spears, and nets) were a little creepy because they were all around the town. I enjoyed this movie I hope you do too! "
1031,5,-i actualy liked this movie. theres nothing wrong with it.
1032,5,"-A funny movie that gets everybody in the family belly laughing, Luca is a brilliant Pixar feature. I would recommend it to any family who enjoy films like Inside Out, Zootopia or really any of Pixar's amazing movies. But although all the family will deeply enjoy it and want to watch it again and again, only 9+ will really appreciate the emotional ending."
1033,5,"-This is a really fun and wholehearted movie that kids will love! It's about a young boy who is a sea monster, ventures out into a small Italian town to make a new adventures."
1034,5,-i still love it! maybe a little intense with the fighting and everything but it is still great.
1035,8,"-Maleficent was truly magnificent, though I wouldn't recomend it for 7 and under because the scenes are a bit dark and have a little violence. Other then that it was good. The only things that I think relate to ""sleeping beauty"" are the set up and cast, but Maleficent is a movie in itself. Angelina Jollie and Elle Fanning did a great job as Maleficent and Princess Aurora. My absolute favorite character had to be Maleficent for her brilliant acting. I think it is a good family movie and if I had the chance to I would definitely go see it again."
1036,8,"-When Maleficent was fighting, it was a bit too violent but there is a good message later on in the film."
1037,8,-It was just a dark retelling of Sleeping Beauty. Nothing extraordinary but still good.
1038,8,"-Maleficent is a great movie based on the original fairy tale of ""Sleeping Beauty"" but from the villain's point of view. The movie does have some violence and some scary scenes, which could be disturbing for some children. However, Maleficent is a very creative version of ""Sleeping Beauty"" that shows a totally different side of the story."
1039,8,"-I saw this movie with my family, and it was better than I was expecting. Such a great movie with heartwarming scenes. Although some of the scenes (SPOILER ALERT) were a bit intense for some kids in my opinion like when Maleficent wakes up and realizes her wings have been cut off and cries out in distress, and when Maleficent is trapped in a net which is hurting her. But these scenes are not too intense from my perspective. Another thing is when (ANOTHER SPOILER) rescues a crow he turns him into a naked man But NOTHING below the waist is shown so it is not that innaproprate  at all and nothing sexual is seen or done. This movie is pretty good and has great messages like not letting anger make you a horrible person and that some men are not as nice as they seem."
1040,8,"-I’m ten and I LOVED!!!! this movie it is beautiful and surprising not like any other movie I’ve ever seen.  Very intense and includes a VERY powerful message.  I would recommend 9-10 year olds for good reasons: Maleficent’s anger is overpowers her and can scare younger kids as can the battle scenes, but the battle scenes are not as scary as some of the reviews have said. This movie is not quite as scary as some of the reviews have said including the one that says there are decapitated people and a bloody stump (which by the way you have to look SUPER close to see any of that)."
1041,8,"-Okay, the violence is the only thing that's not for younger kids. This movie was very good, and the graphics, special CGI effects were just awesome. Okay for 10+"
1042,8,"-I saw this delightful movie with some friends for a birthday party and we were overwhelmed by how extraordinary this film was. It was about love, but not romantic. It was funny at times, but a little scary for younger kids. It was a bit violent at times, but we went with my friend's 7 year old sister and she loved it! I was worried when she began crying, but she said it was because she was happy that Maleficent didn't die. In the scary scenes, she wanted to hide her eyes behind my purse, but it was ok. over all, it was completely amazing. Maleficent was the best movie I've seen in years! I love this film so much that I am going to watch it again!"
1043,8,"-The movie has a good message is funny, somewhat saddening, exciting, and beautiful at the same time. Angelina Jolie was amazing at her part. Great twist on a classic tale!"
1044,8,"-Great movie!!!!!! The only bad part about it is when Maleficent gets her wings cut off(no blood though, just sad). The movie is worth going too. My eleven year old sister and I really enjoyed it."
1045,8,"-My rating PG-13: intense sequences of violence, and language."
1053,7,"-Delightful, tween-friendly story of Jamaican bobsledders."
1054,7,-I liked the movie because the bobsled races where cool and if I was there I think it would be fun. I like the lesson in the movie like if you believe in your self you can achieve your goals and don't cheat and to respaced each other and other people. and i liked the way the Jamaican's talked it was funny. 
1055,7,"-I watched this movie with my family, and while there are really positive messages like work hard for what you believe in and teamwork, there also, unfortunately  A LOT of swearing and a sexual reference where on of the characters says, ""I've known you since she asked to see your ding-a-ling."" which made me feel very uncomfortable as a 14 year old girl. I would recommend it, but definetly talk with your kids about the pros and cons."
1056,7,-I really enjoyed it; it was so funny. So many funny jokes and comments that made me laugh. I really enjoyed the end it was very inspiring.
1057,7,-Good family movie
1058,7,"-Cool Runnings is an awesome movie! Everyone should watch it. It has a bit of swearing but not bad. Great lesson about teamwork and never giving up. Good movie to watch on a movie night and as a family. Overall, excellent movie and a must watch!"
1059,7,-This is a great movie. I really like it because. It is funny and  show's you can do anything if you put your mind to it  :) :) :) :) :) :)
1060,7,-Some swearing and a little fighting but great lesson about  Jamaica and based off of a true story
1061,7,"-I think this movie has a lot of swearing,but i a also learned all about Jamaica."
1092,4,-Not for little kids.
1093,4,-I think it is a good movie but some parts are creepy. There is some parts that are disturbing like this lady who sings on stage and she is wearing almost nothing.
1094,4,"-This and ""Up"" are the best animated movies I think I've ever seen. It's absolutely incredious stop-motion animation is fantastic, and the plot is formulaic and predictable, but you get caught up in it. WATCH THIS MOVIE! Just look out for a scene where an old woman who's extremely chesty that I think should've given ""Coraline"" at least a PG-13 rating."
1095,4,-I love the movie and the book. It's very good for kids my age.
1096,4,-A Good Movie For Older Kids Because I Might Scare Younger Kids. But It Has A Good Message to be careful what you wish for
1097,4,"-It's a weird movie, but it can grow on you. The only violent part about it is how Coraline rips out her other-mother's button eyes. I know. Weird. The inappropriate scene is when Coraline goes to the elderly women's preformance. One of the women is only wearing stars over her breasts and a small pair of under-wear. There aren't any good role-models in this film because they're all crazy and rude."
1098,4,-It was so Awesome I went to see it with my little sister and her friend and I wasn't dissapointed. I later learned almost all my friends loved it. I wanna go read the book now
1099,4,"-This movie was made by the animation maestro Henry Selick, who also directed the masterpiece ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (Tim Burton only PRODUCED, people). That fact, and it's source material, a novella by Neil Gaiman, one of the darkest, and best authors currently living, means that this may  not be suitable for young, young children."
1100,4,"-We think only adults in a weird mood will enjoy it! We guess it's okay for 13 and up, but it should not be watched by little dudes. There is one very inappropriate scene when Coraline goes to the theater and even if it is just a costume, it is so wrong! This should be rated PG13, Keep your kids away from creepy Coraline!"
1101,4,-I love this movie... its great.. and I mean its great!! Im 15 and notice that it is still great. Im not really 4.. but listen! This movie is so great so I got it for free at http://www.rewards1.com/index.php?referrer_id=52805
1102,8,-It's really good and also long I think this book was really good and it was also my first ever book I recommend it! and its also very interesting.
1103,8,-Love this.
1104,8,-I really liked the book Crenshaw because it makes the reader think a lot about the struggles of homelessness. 
1105,8,-read it.
1106,8,-This book is really cute and sweet. Jackson is really funny and there is nothing bad in this book! Crenshaw is my favorite character and Robin is also funny too!
1107,8,"-I thought that Crenshaw was an interesting book. It had a lot of flashbacks which made it confusing to some. It also had a lot of things that are about being homeless and (SPOILER ALERT!) About stealing that might make some people a little un - comfortable. All in all though, I thought it was a great book with great life - lessons, interesting characters, and great role - models. P.S, There were some cool facts snuck into the books..."
1108,8,-A book about a family with a kid who believes in facts until he gets the imaginary friend he needs
1109,8,-This book is super uplifting and talks about a kid named Jackson whos is going thourgh rough times with losing their house and Imaginary friends
1110,8,"-What do you think it would be like to have no money, and no food?? That is how Jackson's family is.  Crenshaw is his imaginary ginormous cat friend who helps him through the building blocks of life. Read this book, and I assure you it will melt your heart..."
1118,8,"-Dora the explorer is basiclly about a girl and a monkey and together they go on adventures. I loved the show when i was 3-6  and i think prechooler would enjoy the show. She learn kids some basic spanish like hola and bien.  Parents might get irritated of the opening since the lyrics is the name  ""do-do-do-dora"" yelled randomly to the music. I don't get why everyone hates when she say things like ""what was your favourite part"" and replays ""It was mine too"" or something like that, but what is she supposed to say?  ""I hate hat part"" or something similar? Like csm said, there is a bunch of dora toys, clothing,  games etc. The show gets too much hate, it's a show for kids after all!"
1119,8,"-Although Dora is likable to some people, I am well on the contrary to that. Swiper is too scary to sensitive viewers and is a bad example to kids. He teaches them how to steal stuff from other! Her shirt is too small and exposes her belly button! People between the ages of 2 and 5 are too young to learn Spanish. They barely know how to talk yet. The worst part is that this show may teach Mexican children and parents how to sneak into the United States illegally due to her over-inspiring nature about adventure, culture, and her willingness to travel the world and having too much perseverance to inspire people to become fugitives. Plus, it is too dangerous to go miles away from their home alone with a monkey named Boots. They could get killed by a serial killer, get lost, even with map, and go to dangerous places they have no idea about. Overall, this show is no good at all to people!"
1120,8,"-Dora goes to completely unrealistic places, and the antagonist, Swiper the Fox, is a complete fool."
1121,8,-this show is anoying
1122,8,-cuz she screams and stuff. And is violent n stuff. do nit watch.
1123,8,"-Okay,I used to LOVE this,had a lot of DVDS but the main problem is that the plot is always the same:"
1124,8,"-Dora has a rabid monkey, she runs into the forest with it. She doesn't tell her parents when she leaves. All in all, Dora is a bad example for children!"
1125,8,"-All they have to do to stop Swiper is say ""Swiper, no swiping!"" and then he says ""Awwwwww, meaaaaaan!"" and he goes away. That's absolutely stupid! If Swiper is the villain, why does he listen to Dora and Boots?"
1126,8,-It barleys teaches spanish!it steaches bad stuff like talking to strangers and playing wity animals that could he dangerous or have disease!its anoying to.dont bother!
1127,8,-It is educational for little kids
1128,8,-i can't believe that people would let their kids watch this. HER BELLY IS SHOWING PEOPLE!!!!
1129,8,"-I Hate This Show Its Retarded,  Annoying,   Horrible And Bad,  Children Should Never Watch This Show They Should Watch Proper Kids Shows Like Bob The Builder Or Thomas The Tank Engine And Friends Or Fireman Sam Or Pingu."
1130,8,"-Dora the Explorer is a really amazing show. It sends great messages for kids ages 2 to 10. Its also funny, and it can teach kids to talk a little Spanish, and be super nice to other people. That's why Dora the Explorer is a really amazing show for kids to watch. There is nothing negitive about the show at all."
1131,8,-I think Dora is a great remodel for children. I would totally recommend Dora!!
1132,8,"-Not only does it teach kids Spanish the wrong way (seems to suck at pronunciation), but their method is to say something in Spanish without saying what it means. It turns this otherwise unremarkable Nicktoon into barely comprehensible crap that has plenty of errors and has annoying characters, bad writing, obnoxious songs and mediocre animation."
1133,8,"-Goatworlds here. Mediocre animation, bad plot, no action, crappy adventures, pathetic voice-acting, and unlikable characters. Swiper the braindead fox is horrible at stealing! He gives anything back when they say ""Swiper, no swiping!"" Just a girl and her monkey go on crappy adventures."
1134,8,"-Dora wants kids to yell. It's okay for her to teach Spanish, but yelling louder and teaching kids to jump of something? What if kids are playing Dora and they jump of a table? Do you even like the Grumpy Old Troll to scare kids with his scary lines? Swiper the Fox is mean! He steals something in every episode! Kids will learn stealing. She's so annoying! The laet time I liked watching Dora was when I was 7! I'd rather rewatch Team "
1135,8,"-The show is just stupid. The characters are just stupid. There is nothing promising about this TV series. It is great for 2-5 year olds, but then it is just idiotic. The show is part of the larger Dora The Explorer Franchise and the creators are more interested in making money off kids."
1136,8,-Don't watch it much but its allright
1137,8,"-Ugh, this show is SO IRRATATING. It gives me a headache. A really bad one. The songs are so annoying, the acting is crappy, and there is NOTHING good about this crapfest."
1138,8,"-Parents and kids from ages 0-7 will love Dora, but trust me, things will start to change once you hit ages 8-17. You'll just think that it's a bunch o' ""Swiper, no swiping!!"" trash. Believe me, I went through that phase myself. The only reason I still watch this is because I have a 1-year old sister going through the short phase in life where she enjoys Nick Jr."
1139,8,-Hate it u know what I don't really know where to start but you know what I'll just talk about swiper yea wat is wrong with him when for and her friends go swiper no swiping he goes OOOO MAANN like what is it with him if he is really soo bad y doesn't he just steal it I mean c'mon he's one of the worst tv characters I've ever known about except for mike the knight he is stupid also
1140,8,-This show is so annoying and lame. I can't stand the songs. They are stupid and annoying. The characters are so crappy. There is not 1 good thing I can think about Dora the Explorer.
1141,8,"-Okay, I can understand some of the hate, but there's no need to say it's not for kid's. Yes, Dora does ask where certain things are when they are right behind her, but she's trying to let little kid's guess. Once your kid is about 6 they will start to hate Dora, but toddlers will love it."
1142,8,"-This show so bad, it's almost comical. The plot is screwed up. A girl and a monkey go on crappy adventures. The animation is HORRIBLY drawn, the acting is atrocious, the characters are unlikeable, and the theme song is just horrible. This is the 2nd worst show ever (with the worst being Incredible Crew). Please Nick Jr, cancel this garbage and don't give it any reruns. Oh, and parents, skip this crap and try 64 Zoo Lane."
1143,8,"-I *bleep*ing hate this show. It sucks. Too much breaking the fourth wall and the songs are so stupid, you might think that your brain melted. Yes, it's that crappy!"
1144,8,"-WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY, I LOVED THIS SHOW! NOW WE HAVE THIS STUPIDITY TO DEAL WITH, DON'T BOTHER, IT'S BAD! IT'S SO BAD IT MAKES ME WANNA PUKE BECAUSE IT HAS GONE DOWNHILL! DO NOT WATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dear God, please cancel this show!"
1145,8,"-How can anyone like this show? It is really annoying and it breaks the fourth wall too much. It gives me headaches, it burns my eyes, and that is my BIGGEST objection to this show. It was good when they broke the fourth wall on Blue's Clues, but this? No way. I can go on and on but my review is just going to be 4 rants on Dora the Explorer. Is Nick Jr REALLY desperate for ratings? So desperate they must put on crappy shows jamming in little kids' heads? Obviously so. Lastly, has anyone noticed that Dora and boots walk on a road with NO SIDEWALKS? They can get injured. Nick Jr needs to come up with little kid shows that has the abilty to entertain not just little kids, but also older kids and adults. But instead, they are making crappy shows that give you headaches. I hope this show gets cancelled. RANT 2: When I was watching this crap while babysitting, it was so bad I actually felt pain in my chest. Yes, it was that bad. Honestly, what was Nick Jr thinking? I have so many questions for the creator, but I can't think of them all. What's the deal with the theme song? It is so annoying. Lastly, does anyone else hate that they break the fourth wall too much? In Blue's Clues, they made breaking the fourth wall fun. Blue's Clues was my childhood, and it's a shame Nick Jr took it off the air. Sadly, they let Dora stay on the air. No fair. Dora should be cancelled, and Blue's Clues should return. Blue's Clues rules. Dora is moronic and dimented. Dora the Explorer is crap. Blue's Clues is much better. OK, rant 2 was a little too long. But still, Dora sucks really badly. I love to bash shows I hate with a passion, and I also love saluting shows I love. Dora is a show I really hate. RANT 3: This show is so bad it hurts. I'm not joking, I can't believe how bad it is. Who came up with this idiot-fest? I have LOTS of questions for the creators of this crap, but I can't think of them all. If anyone else agrees with me, ask the creators of this show some of the questions I have for them. This is the worst little kids show of all-time, but it's also one of my most hated shows in general. Finally, I can't help but notice that they break the fourth wall on this crap. That is the biggest objection I have to Dora the Explorer. It was good when they broke the fourth wall on Blue's Clues, but this show FAILS at breaking the fourth wall. RANT 4: Is there some kind of inside joke in this show that i'm not getting? This show is super painful to watch. Who came up with this junk? I have so many other questions that I want to ask the creator of this show, but I can't think of the all. If anyone agrees with me, i'm honored. Lastly, has anyone noticed that this show FAILS at breaking the fourth wall? Blue's clues did a great job at breaking the fourth wall. Dora however, is the COMPLETE OPPISITE. Dora and Boots are annoying people. They are such s****y characters (sorry for the foul laungage). Blue's Clues was my childhood, and it's a shame Nick Jr took it off the air. To make matters worse, they put on Dora. Which is moronic crap. Have I bashed this show enough? I think so."
1146,8,-Well hmm......... Dora is okay.... but I wouldn't recommend it for kids over 6 But I love Boots! I like the culture and Spanish words that they teach. So I think it's better than ALOT of shows.
1157,8,"-If you are a teen then this is a great movie. Very funny, and a must watch. Has some inappropriate scenes, so +13."
1158,8,"-Even though Jim Carrey has done some pretty decent movies (Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Liar Liar, The Mask), there is nothing he does that is quite as hysterical as this one right here, Dumb and Dumber."
1159,8,-Jim Carrey was pretty good in this movie but lots of iffy stuff so be warned.
1160,8,"-The movie is good, but the comedy is very immature and woman are very objectified. Sometimes the main character’s stupidness is almost painful. Lyod fantasies about having sex with Mary, ( nothing is shown except for her top half with censored breasts and her lower butt.) This is definitely for older tweens who aren’t very sensitive."
1161,8,"-This movie is just hysterical. I entirely recommend it! Jim Carrey's character is enough to make you laugh as it is, but adding great script writing and just plain dumb humor, it makes you burst out with laughter! I enjoyed this movie a whole lot. Getting down to the age part, there are a few things in this movie, but it's not too much in my opinion. As for language, it's pretty mild. The one thing I heard was ass, and bitch. There are a few mild moments of sexual innuendo including Jim Carrey telling his friend to tell a girl that he has rapist wits, but it's used very comical.  Jim Carrey also imagines what it'll be like when he brings this girl's briefcase back, and he imagines them dating, him at a diner behaving like a martial artist and attacking waiters and he rips the heart out of one guy. This whole scene is entirely comical, and it doesn't feel very disturbing. After that, he imagines them taking off their clothes, and Jim Carrey looks down to the girl's breasts, and the breasts are then covered by car lights, and he wakes up to see a car and that he's still driving. A girl gives Harry a carrot and two pieces of coal to put on a snow man, but instead he decides to make it into a penis and testicles and puts it on the lower part of the snowman. In a bathroom scene, Jim Carrey's character sees a note that says ""Meet me at 2:15 in the stall so we can make manly love together"" and Carrey looks at his watch realizing that it is 2:15. The man comes in and starts forcingly trying to beat him up or forcingly make love to him, but he is interrupted eventually.  Some women are seen in bikinis in a car and say that they're looking for two men to oil them up for the beach or something like that. There are a few referrences to alcohol, smoking and drunk driving, but it's nothing too serious. In the film a man is shot and another is killed by eating hot peppers, but to be honest, the violence in this film is pretty mild by today's standards. But all in all, great movie, and I hope you'll laugh your butt off watching it!"
1162,8,"-Dumb and dumber is sorta funny! There are references to ""banging"", and some penis jokes. Attempted rape, with pubic hair visible. Harry makes a snowman a penis. A man and woman hug and you see her butt (he lifts her skirt). They prepare to have sex. Tour bus scene with loads of sexual references. Brief use of ""shaggin' wagon"". Explicit boning reference. Harry's butt crack is visible in one scene. Some uses of s**t, p***y and a**h**e. Some violence including a scene where a man rips out another's heart. Not innapropriate. A surprisingly decent comedy!"
1163,8,"-About a quarter of the way through this movie my parents realized that maybe it wasn't the best form me (age 12) and my sister (age 8) to watch. At one part a guy is day dreaming about this girl he likes and he pulls up her dress to see if she is wearing underwear, SHE IS NOT! we actually saw a close up of her butt! yes, it was kind of funny but I think that crossed the line. also a lot of unnecessary swears. Finally so many poop jokes. I think that a few potty jokes are funny but when it keeps going for almost two hours it becomes so crude. Do to really recommend aside to a few very funny jokes the rest wasn't too good. And it was wayyy to crude for me."
1164,8,-So.....disappointed
1196,7,-you should watch it
1214,8,"-This show is amazing! I watched it all in a day, and it was short and sweet. The representation is spectacular, and show’s characters have good character development. I think this show is for 10+ because some concepts younger children may not understand. I definitely recommend."
1215,8,-Really touching TV series about transgender girl.
1297,7,-I love this movie! SLAPPPPPYYYY!
1298,7,"-I went to go see this in the movie theaters when I was seven years old. I thought it was creepy, but the laughs are extremely frequent. Now that I'm turning ten this year, 2017, and I've watched Poltergeist, Coraline, The Sixth Sense and The Others, this movie is not scary for me."
1299,7,"-Some monsters may be creepy, but nothing to worry about. Not much else to say."
1300,7,-it is scary because it is horror
1301,7,-RL. Stine movie is based on a book of goosebumps
1302,7,"-This movie was outstanding and amazing. It takes all of R. L. Stine's creations and makes something great out of it. The plot and characters are awesome and incredibly likeable, and it's the cast was great with people such as Jack Black. The animation is amazing and great to watch. There is a bit of kissing and someone brings up ""drugs"" once, but it's not that bad. It's a good movie and has everything a good movie needs. I can not express how much i love this movie. I'm sure there's a lot more to say, but i'm just drawing a blank right now. Simply, this movie is awesome."
1303,7,"-This movie is great but includes monsters coming to life. It also has a creepy ventriloquist's dummy that comes to life with that horrifying smile of his. But, the movie is also very funny. But there is a killer clown in some scenes named Murder. This could scare kids because of the new clown sight reportings. There are also falling in love scenes like a boy and a girl kissing each other on the lips. But other then that, this movie is hilarious! :) ;)"
1304,7,"-A very well designed movie starring Jack Black. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because I wish that it included more of the monsters. I could see myself screaming with happiness if they had the creeps or madam doom in the movie. Any fans of the books will like it will be very happy but anyone who likes a good scare and is NOT a fan of the books might be dissapointed. However, there are three particularly scary parts very close together. First, the mantis strikes the bus R. L. Stine  is in, and a bomb goes off. Next, Slappy finds Stine hiding in a amusement park and releases the blob, which traps him. Finally, the 3 kids are in a ferries wheel and Zach has just finished the story when the hinges go loose and the wheel goes rolling off into the woods. Good, but don't show to the little ones."
1305,7,-I love this movie!
1306,7,-Really good but could be better. Pretty scary for kids under seven.  They could use more monsters in it though. The monsters look  real.  So good!!
1335,8,"-This movie lacks excessive foul language and sexual themes, but is very gruesome and violent. Shows intense bloody and mangled bodies, but if you can handle it I would recommend for mature kids 13+"
1336,8,-WAY TO VIOLENT NOT JUST NOT FOR KIDS!!!
1337,8,"-This film is fantastic I have nothing bad to say about it. Mel Gibson has definitely proven himself as a high quality director if that was not already evident. Desmond Doss' amazing true story is truly inspirational and he represents a good role model for kids. However, this movie is way to violent for kids and I would not show it to anyone who is at least 15. The war violence is about as graphic as Saving Private Ryan so it gets pretty bloody, apart from that this movie is definitely great for a movie night given that your children can handle the graphic violence."
1338,8,-It is one of Mel Gibson best movies along with passion of the Christ and braveheart. Be AWARE this movie has extremely disturbing violence along with a few s-words and a sexual implication.
1339,8,"-Hacksaw Ridge is a true story about a man who saved 75 wounded soldiers from battle. The film is extremely violent, in a way that kind of affects your soul. There are wounded/dead soldiers everywhere (there is one shoot of a dead body with intestines coming out). In one scene (which I believe was the most affecting and violent scene in the film) a man's feet are blown off (he looked like someone dipped his feet in a mincer). The man was screaming in pain and some soldiers where saying to let him die. The fact that this stuff actually happens is heartbreaking. This is by far the most violent movie I have ever seen. The profanity isn't so bad. The worst thing said is the S-word. There is one sex scene between a married couple with no nudity and another scene where a naked man is seen training for battle. His bottom is seen about two or three times, however it is pretty funny. This movie shows how bad war actually is (I usually underestimate the horrors of war since I obviously haven't been in a battle). It is mainly about loving your neighbor AND ENEMIES as your self and doing the right thing. If your like me and love war movies, then this movie is CERTAINLY for you."
1340,8,"-It's a VERY GOOD movie! Desmond Doss got the honor he very much deserved! But... IT'S VERY GORY AND GRUESOME! Including a man getting half of his head and brains blown out on to another guy who also gets his chest shot out, People flying in the air on fire and screaming in agony, a guy on the ground with his legs reduced to strings of blood and flesh, and a Japanese leader getting his head chopped off! Another thing there is a little bit of nudity, not that bad though just a guy naked but it only shows his buttocks. And that's not even all, yet, it's a masterpiece and I highly recommend watching it if your 13 or older. I was 13 when I watched it, and I have no regrets watching it at all! Well, that's all I have to say. I hope this helps you decide to watch it!"
1341,8,"-This movie is quite good, but definitely, and this isn't like the exaggerated call of duty reviews. PARENTS IT IS GORY I'M NOT JOKING. This movie is extremely gory, I know allot of things are but, the scenes are quick for the gore, they are long. They make sure you can see the gore. So parents, definitely 15 or 16+. This movie is not for kids, it wasn't meant to be. Good movie though."
1342,8,-it is the most inspirational movie you can watch and has amazing role models in it!!!
1343,8,-This is an amazing film and I would recommend it to everyone. However it does have extreme violence and upsetting scenes that aren't appropriate for young teens.
1344,8,-but too much bad violence scenes.
1456,8,"-Great movie, but the bleakest film I have ever seen. The CGI was poor but ok. The film didn't make me feel great to be alive. This only has jump scares and not much gory violence. Good but bleak."
1457,8,-Pretty good. nuff said
1458,8,"-This film was so good, better than expected, to be honest I found this pretty emotional, like when they all die, i cried soo much , it was violent but personally it did not scare me at all just a little violent. Anyway a definite watch, oh it also depends on you wether you like this type of stuff for me it was a no scare but if you dont like things that jump out i'd say it was a no for you"
1459,8,-this movie is very violent
1460,8,-This is good! I just got this on blu ray at target for 7.50. I watched it and liked it. I thought some scenes were kind of scary. No people get shown eaten. Will does shoot zombies sometimes with no blood. There is no language or sex in this movie. Will is a good role model. I would not recommend this film to kids under 12
1461,8,-intense and very scary but good. some disturbing and sad scenes. also some jump-scenes.
1462,8,-I think this is a very good movie. It is for kids from 10+. It isn't too fright as they say. It just haves a lot of suspence. The mutants aren't that scary. Kids WILL like this movie.
1463,8,"-Some scary parts. If you can't take that movie, go watch my little pony"
1567,8,"-This game is the best just dance yet! It has WAY more songs and more options. It has really nice songs and its a fun way to be exercised. Some parent reviews I just read said the songs with to much sex in it but everything about sex in songs is blurred. One parent said she won't even let her high school son play it but really that's just RIDICULOUS grow up parents! They picked out some big pop hits and some classics. Really fun game for people to play,so BUY IT!"
1568,8,"-censored swearing, lyrics related to drinking, s#xual lyrics and themes, and that's all"
1569,8,"-This is a fun game for all ages to get moving. Best played with a camera to more accurately track movement. Characters can wear suggestive clothing, and some lines can be slightly suggestive, but it mostly goes over kids heads."
1570,8,"-out of all of the just dance games I've played, this one is amazing. it's taken a really big step from the previous game. some songs have some sexual references, or alcohol references, but it's not that bad. I've seen numerous comments saying this game is for people that are 18+ and I don't get it. just dance is supposed to be for all ages and if it's for all ages, all the songs wouldn't be aimed towards only children because it wouldn't amuse the older people who want to play it. and as if the children are going to understand the explicit lyrics, along with just dance censoring it. yes, some songs' meanings are straight up sex, but it's not like your kid is gonna go ""oh yea this song is about sex?? he'll yeah let's go fuck a random person at a bar now 🤪 so cool"" or drugs like "" omg this song is about drugs lemme go smoke some weed and do some heroin"". honestly. they aren't gonna understand what it means. and they gotta know someday. overall this game is amazing for all ages and gets everyone off their butt and start dancing. I love it, radiates good energy, and is great for a family night or a sleepover with your best friends."
1571,8,"-When you are stuck in quarantine, what is better than move around! They have so much fun dances, and they have cool songs like, 'kiss you, just dance, I will survive, ghostbusters, and YMCA, and LOTS of 1960-90 music' These are really fun, But it does have some native women with bras. Also some lyrics that say  '(gimme) that yum like a (Lollypop)' , if your kid wants it for a special event you do, please make their wish come true! :)"
1572,8,"-The game is pretty good, World Dance Floor is a groundbreaking experience  to play with other Just Dancers all around the world. Sad the servers were shutdown for this game."
1573,8,-I think it is great for families and It contains a lot of copyrighted music.
1574,8,"-If you're a bit overweight, then this is the ultimate fix.  This got me back in shape in the span of 1 summer.  They have finally added a calorie counter that can be used for all songs, and have put less 1D songs (thank the Lord!).  The songs are great, and my request was fulfilled (more old songs please, and ""Just a Gigolo"" is there.  They have made the songs even more culturally diverse (instead of just Indian songs ""Katti Kalandal"", and ""Beware of the Boys"") they have added Moskau.  The songs require a lot of practice, but improving is very rewarding.  It's motivational to me that I can get coins and spend them on routines in any way or order that I want, instead of the game deciding which song I get.  This has gotten a bit more racy (with the dancer in the Chris Brown song touching his chest, and the ""Gentleman"" dancer pelvic thrusting and grabbing his crotch).  Not for little kids, booze and Illuminati was mentioned.  I like the ""Roar"" song because it's self empowering.  Two thumbs up from me."
1575,8,-stupidly bad game.
1576,8,-is really bad for kids. There are some songs that are VERY innapropriate.
1587,6,"-This movie is full of characters who are suposed to represent ""girl power"". Instead it just holds a girl who runs around with  bunch of gadgets, and unrealisticly can out-kick and out-punch mean henchmen.   (a rather skinny girl just starting high school?),as she flips around with a bunch of acrobatic and in the air flips and spins. Not a girl model I would like children to see. My younger siblings even started doing karate type moves after watching it. Not safe for themselves and they may hurt each other.  It isn't too different from any modern superhero movie, except that it is more cheesy.  If you want your girl to get the impresion that she has to act like a tomboy, or she's not worth anything, than go ahead and watch. Plus the fact that most of the female characters are wearing skin tight clothes. "
1588,6,-They have to fight (Fight!) a virus (Virus!)
1589,6,"-The Kim Possible movie is surprisingly good. Lots of people thinks this movie sucks, and while it doesn’t top the original, I still had a fun time with this movie. It was fun to see these beloved characters and places adapted into live action. And while then clothes aren’t the best, I hardly have a problem with it. Sure, this movie has some bad spots, but all movies do, even great ones. However, this movie isn’t as kid-friendly as the show."
1590,6,"-To start off, the actor who played Ron Stoppable made my ears bleed. He was such an annoying character, who made you cringe more than laugh. He didn't have any likeable traits, and wasn't anything like the original Ron Stoppable. The jokes in this movie weren't funny, and the puns made it worse. They often tried to make it feel more ""relatable"" to kids, but it came across as trying too hard. The main character Kim didn't do the original character justice. She was very whiny, and didn't send a good message about supporting your friends. I had an idea of what I was getting into when I decided to watch this movie, but it was still disappointing with how they botched such a funny and creative show."
1591,6,"-They don't really explain the backstory of Kim but the music is catchy, seeing Athena's head in a pile of rubble is freaky, espescially since she talking then, and the movie overall isn't that interesting and Athena goes from good to bad to good again which is weird, but, the moral of not being jealous and strong females is ensuring that the writers had good intentions"
1592,6,-I think that Kim Possible is appropriate for kids 9 and up because it presents the importance of friendship and teamwork while incorporating kid friendly humor. It teaches kids how to grapple with jealousy and other simple day to day struggles that we kids might not know how to approach.
1593,6,-I loved the Kim Possible show but the Movie is just another one of those Disney Live-Action films that ruin the original. I'd rather do my homework than watch this.
1594,6,-I really like it
1595,6,-Based on what i read is that Kim possible is the best movie and kim possible help people that are in danger that why i like the movie
1596,6,-This movie is amazing! It was made last year 2019 it was the best movie ever! also kind sad tough but most of it I liked.
1628,8,-good movie acting was amazing...I just thought muscials were supposed to be haaaapppppyyyyy :'( Other than that it was an amazing musical. Emma Stone was AMAZING!! and she has a lovely voice.
1629,8,-This is a great story about never giving up on your dreams and a love story between two people. I would not let your child watch this movie if they are unaware of what the middle finger means. Overall a wholesome movie with a truely amazing soundtrack that made me love jazz music.
1630,8,-Romantic musical with awesome actors and awesome music.
1631,8,"-This movie is gorgeous!! The colors, the songs, the music, the dances and the actors are all so amazing!! It's hard to explain it with words! The story is about two people Sebastian and Mia who are trying to pursue their dreams. Mia wants to be an actress and Sebastian wants to have his own jazz club. After they keep running into each other they decide to pursue their love affair. Will they be able to fall in love and pursue their dreams or not? Watch this movie to find out!! "
1632,8,"-I LOVED this movie, and I don't usually do musicals. It was very clean, with the exception of some language,  but it was not too excessive.  I wouldn't recommend it for kids because it is just a very mature movie and the ending would be hard for a kid to understand(it made me cry). But the story was great, it had amazing music and is definitely a perfect movie if you're looking for a romance/musical."
1633,8,"-I am in love this movie. I love everything from the songs to the actors to the choreography. I watched this movie with my 8-year-old sister and we loved it! It is worth the money, trust me you will love it. It’s not a cheesy romance movie, but it is about chasing your dreams."
1634,8,"-I saw this when it first came out in theaters and my first thoughts were ""Ok this isn't to bad"" about 20 minutes in I realized that it was probably the worst movie I've ever scene.  The plot is terrible and unless you like watching actors act like there professional dancers when they probably have never taken a class in there life you'll hate it.  About half way through I began to regret some life choices like wasting 2 hours of my life on a movie that doesn't even have a good plot.  Once it was over I'd decided that I would rather be at the dentist than watching this movie.  It's fine for kids ages 7 and up but it's not good so just don't bother."
1635,8,-This movie was suburb with great messages  about love and creativity but strong language like F.. K and s.. T this movie is perfect for kids 9 and up
1645,7,-This game or app is only for ages 2 to 4
1699,8,"-It's a great example and an iconic landmark for gaming. It's a very social, family friendly game. It's very fun and can be played for hours as every race is different."
1700,8,"-This game is so fun! It's for all ages and anyone, even those who never played any of the Mario Bros. games."
1701,8,-i played this game at age 3 the graphic had  bit pixel but good the game had weapons like bombs blue bombs and shells like red shells green shells i still have a copy  of the game i'm gonna keep the game and copy has a Mario game its not like the 1983 Mario game its Karting game that has some violence but no blood.
1702,8,"-Mario kart wii is honestly my favorite mk game, solely for how many available modifications there are. A few are scams, but the real ones like CTGP-R make the game really fun, and the best Mario kart."
1703,8,"-I think Mariokart Wii is a fun game, and when I first played it with my cousin, we had lots of fun playing it, and we could not stop. I enjoy playing it today, and it is one of my favorite games to play."
1704,8,-Mario Kart has a lot of great games but this is one of the best.
1705,8,"-The first thing to note is that the game is amazing. I recieved the game when I was five, along with the Nintendo Wii.  The game is fun for the whole family; multiplayer is a must play. The only thing to note is that the game can be frustrating for younger kids at first, as the controls can be a bit finnicky. In addition, it's recommended to start out on Automatic Mode, (versus Manual Mode.) This allows you to turn easily, without the unnecessary buttons involved. However, this comes at a price. It is significantly harder to win on Automatic Mode. And that can be frustrating. However, with time, Manual mode can seem easy."
1706,8,-It's good for the whole family. a fun fast easy to learn racing game with Mario and freinds! A bit of cartoon violence but still worth playing if over 6.
1707,8,-Fine for kids. Just racing. You can sometimes throw weapons at other characters. No blood. All animated.
1708,8,-Great cast but strange thing to watch
1709,8,"-there is a lot of violence characters are set on fire, blown up, aliens head explodes with green blood but it is all done digitally and very easy to tell it's fake-5+"
1710,8,"-Some really strong violence in this film, Characters are burned by lazar guns to the bone, a talking human head is scene of the body with blood, the president is stabbed through the back, Aliens heads splatter with green goo. Some language to like S-t, Ass,A-hole, Prick and Crap. Some sexual stuff to like scantily clad women and rumbling camper van which implies there having rough sex. Also some scenes at a casino, Social drinking and cigar puffing."
1711,8,-Trash!
1712,8,-This is a good movie with some intense scary moments and funny moments. I think kids under 8 will be hurt cause of these scenes
1713,8,-This film is funny as hell. The Martian’s killing everyone may be abnoxious but Funny at the same time. Features an all star cast starring Batmans Jack Nicholson as President James Dale and also plays some person in Vegas. Other cast members include Glenn Cosse and Back To The Futures Micheal J Fox. And of course Tom Jones appears. Sadly it Bombed at the Box Office.
1714,8,"-This is the movie that sci-fi, horror, comedy, and Tim Burton classic that are all bunched together to make an action packed film that anyone will love. The movie has a COUPLE swear words in it.  Also the martians and what they do may as well be kinda creepy, this is a great alien movie that anyone would love."
1715,8,-I watched it when I was 14.  I understand why my parents wouldn't let me watch it before that.  It is because of the scene where the President gets stabbed.  That bit is a bit gruesome and may have freaked me out when I was about 10.  I loved the whole movie and has replaced Dispicable Me as my all time favourite movie!
1716,8,-Occasional cigarettes are seen. 2 characters flirt on a TV show very infrequent moderate sex. Horror is too scary for under 8s. Frequent moderate violence and bloodshed e.g  A alien in disguise bites someone's fingers off and heads explode. (At different times in the movie.) A peaceful woman refers to being an alcoholic and stopping her addiction. A crucial seen is a casino in Vegas and a husband tells his wife to ' play for there anversary'.  A man refers to aliens as S word heads. Consumerism ($)wise again gambling occurs and the majority of people are rich. However the film is about teamwork to find a plane (this is at the end) and a woman is purely trying to make peace in her life.
1717,5,-The world's coolest nanny celebrates family and fun.
1718,5,"-Great, classic children's movie. I had to write a film analysis essay for this movie, there are lots of things to praise. Catchy songs and nice character development."
1719,5,"-Mary Poppins is an instant classic, I first watched this movie in March 2020 with my mom when I was sick. I loved it! It took me a few tries for me to understand the plot and stuff. I even have the 50th anniversary DVD of Mary Poppins! It’s just as good as the sequel that came out 54 years later! But I like the first movie better. Mr. Banks can be a little stern, Mrs. Banks sings a song about the right for women to vote “Sister Suffragette”, Ellen and Mrs. Brill are supporting characters. Bert is a peppy chimney sweep and the 1960’s version of Jack The Lamplighter from Mary Poppins Returns. Mary Poppins is everyone’s favorite flying and singing British nanny that’s always prim and proper and is practically perfect in every way. Anyway, if you like fantasies from the 60’s, I’d recommend this one for sure!"
1720,5,"-when I was younger I would constantly watch this amazing movie, it wonderful! even though I do not watch this movie on a regular basis anymore whenever I hear someone talking about it, it still brings a smile to my face every time. its definitely a must watch."
1721,5,"-I saw it for the first time when I was 5 years old, it enchanted me right away."
1722,5,"-Mary Poppins is a great Disney classic. Many people dub it as “Disney’s crowning achievement” or “Disney’s ultimate classic”, and it’s not hard to see why. Ever since it’s release in 1964, it has enchanted generations of people. Adding to that, this film may be one of the more memorable movies of all time. Fun fact: I had only seen this movie once or twice beforehand about 5 or 6 years ago, and so many songs and so much of the story stuck with me."
1723,8,-Max delivers a great message to all viewers. Really hits you in the feel in some scenes.
1724,8,"-This was a really good movie! Max was a great touching story! There were some sad and violent parts that will make you cry but there are a lot of happy parts too, some of those parts make you cry happy tears. If you do not like to cry don't watch this movie! if you diced not to for that reason or any other reasons you will regret i!. The adventure that this movie takes you on is truly amazing! It is also a bit racist and definitly for older kids."
1725,8,-I am not giving 5 stars because it is sad. It has mild violence action and peril just one kiss and language like friggin one sh*t damn and hell. Just one part a man offers someone a beer. My rating PG- mild violence action peril some language and sexuality and brief language.
1726,8,"-For a PG movie it was pretty violent. But let's talk about the movie. I loved it. Me and my mom really don't see that many movies together because I mean we like Bourne thrillers but this movie was great. I didn't think it was bad at all. Violence was pretty heavy for a PG movie lol. There was gun fights, punching, kidnapping, tense senses were dogs are being shot, villain killed by dog, RPGS firing at kids (no joke) and some language such as D words. But other than that it was ok for kids. This girl beside was surprised at the PG rating. But I had fun with it. Good movie :)"
1727,8,-Max is the story of a military dog of the same name. When his owner was killed in Afganistan and comes back home. At first Justin wants nothing to do with the dog until he takes the responsability of caring for it.  Max changed him from a bratty teenager to someone who takes responsibility for the things around him.
1728,8,"-My rating:PG-13 for intense sequences of war violence,sensuality,and brief language."
1729,8,"-This was a really good movie. I watched it with my sisters (Lara and Judi) and they think it's for babies. But this movie, oh, hoho, this is something else. WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
1730,8,"-This is a really good movie! It's a little scary/dramatic but most kids can probably handle this drama. I really love this movie, at first I was too scared to watch but it was very funny and good! Great message to care about others no matter what other people say."
1731,8,"-It is a very cute movie .I loved it when I watched it when I was little. It teaches us great life lessons such as bee youself (get it...it's not a spelling error)and it doesn't matter what you are and how you look on the outside ,but it is on the inside that really counts.The movie has a lot of adventures in it and I'm sure your kids will like it too."
1732,8,-I think it is for kids 4 to 7.
1733,8,-I really liked this movie because even though there are some inapropriate jokes its really funny and just makes you feel happy
1734,8,"-Mean girls is a hilarious comedy! it does have bitch said a few times, aswell as fugly, slut, skeez, and hobag. but its not that bad. it does have some refernces to sex and drugs, but might fly over someine below the age of 11s head."
1735,8,"-i think that this movie is a really good movie, some of the other parents say it’s disgusting but me and my mom watched it together when i was like 11. there is no f bombs and the language is not that bad. i think if your at least 10 you could watch it. the only scenes that are kinda weird are the ones that made me uncomfortable, they include when regina  george was making out with “i don’t remember his name” and her mom walked in and when an underaged girl made out with the coach. those are the scenes that made me uncomfortable. but over all it’s a really good movie and i think you should watch it when you get the chance :)"
1736,8,-This is one of the best movies ever along with clueless and 10 things I hate about u! Follows the story of cady heron who has been homeschooled her whole life and lived in Africa. the plastics invite her to hang out with them. The plastics are rich and stupid popular girls and throughout the story there are some good and bad examples. But the end lesson is a rlly good lesson. Theres also a burn book where they gossip mean things about other girls and it teaches that gossip isnt ok. I DEFINITELY recommend!
1737,8,"-It is a great movie to watch with friends. Even though there is a lot of swearing and sex talk, most pre-teens already know this and watch a lot of shows/ Movies that talk about it. I think it is for 12 up or kids that are a bit more mature. Overall it's a great movie and definetly recomend."
1738,8,-People may say that mean girls may have a terrible message and the characters are 3 dimensional but to be honest the whole plot and the society within the movie is so true. It portrays how even though  how nice everyone appears people still all hate each other within. It has a good message too. But it's best that children should be more mentally mature to understand the whole plot.
1739,8,"-Good movie for middle school girls. It’s a great movie! It will teach them not to give into peer pressure.  Many girls are mocked for being whores,virgins,lesbians,etc. The teacher tells the girls not to call each other sluts and whores because it makes it ok for guys to call you sluts and whores. Nothing too sexually suggestive except Regina is seen in her bra and a boy named Shane in his underwear.  Cady gets drunk and throws up. It has a happy ending, although the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the relationship between Cady and Aaron was the most bland thing I’ve ever seen in a movie."
1740,8,"-Your kids should probably watch this after they have the talk or something. Regina is a complete b-word and manipulates everyone she meets. Cady is like Regina in one part near the end but mostly a good role model (and a victim). Gretchen and Karen are Regina's dumb a-word minions. Janis and Damian are OK but Janis can be a jerk but not really. All the adults are terrible role models. There is a pretty decent amount of swearing and a moderate amount of sex references. A little bit of violence as you would expect is a PG movie, bloodless and non-scary. A moderate amount of drinking/drugs.  One joke that could be seen as racist. Some pretty good messages, like ""cliques are bad"" and ""be yourself"". So yeah, I think it earned its 14+."
1741,8,-PG-13 for sexual content strong language drinking and violence and a teen story
1742,8,"-Minecraft has been my favorite game since I was a kid! It's fun interactive, and you can see how much the producers really care about their community, sure there is fighting, but nor gore or blood and very little violence, it also influences learning and strategy. Just so you know this is the same game that kicked Roblox and Fortnite off their thrones as the most famous games in the world, so it may not look like much, but try it you'll like!"
1743,8,"-I see so many parents saying ""18+ super violent, you can attack zombies."" Are you kidding me? That just sounds like someone who didn't like the game, but can't come up with an excuse for why not. Minecraft was the first video game i ever owned, and i get nostalgic thinking about it. You can build whatever you want, and create entire worlds. It's perfect for someone like me who is currently creating a fantasy world, by them self. Or maybe you're a kid who wants something to do to kill time. Or maybe you're a gamer who want's to go from start to finish in survival mode, and beat the game in hardcore. Either way, Minecraft is a great game for pretty much anyone!"
1744,8,-I LOVE this game. It is so fun and has lots of educational value. It teaches kids how to build things and let their imagination run free. I recommend this to anyone!
1745,8,"-I personally think this game is the best sandbox game. There are some differences from Windows 10 and Java edition. If I were you, I would choose Java edition. When you first load into the world, you are greeted with a tutorial on one of the top corners of the screen. I would recommend practicing the game in creative mode before going into survival mode. This game can, and will, take quite a bit of skill and training before actually playing it. I would be weary about joining servers. Depending on the people online, you can either have a good or bad experience. There are some people that can bypass the filter and curse. I will recommend you get better at the game before using servers. Being the Teen that I am, I rate Minecraft with a 5-staf rating. Don't judge Minecraft just by YouTube videos made online."
1746,8,-You can do o much i recomend
1747,8,-Very good game!!!
1748,8,-my moms always says im a slow learner. im 10 but im not too good at gramar. u dont need to know gramar for this game its just fun. my mom hasnt told me not to play this so i think its good. i go to church 3 times a week.
1749,8,"-This game is fun, can be educational, and teaches kids about the value of hardwork. In this game you start on a world, you have nothing but the trees and animals surrounding you. You need to,break trees to get, weapons, and building materials. You can kill animals (no blood) to collect food, and materials. Be sure to get into a shelter and night as zombies and other monsters will appear. Your challenge is to survive. If you find survival mode to difficult, go onto creative mode, which enables you to, fly and have unlimited health, and resources. If you haven't got this game by now, you need to get it. This game will be a classic for years to come. There are also a large variety of mods to play with. In this game you can find villagers who will trade with you. This teaches kids the value of items."
1750,8,"-Minecraft is just a game that you'll keep coming back to over and over again, i've played it since 2012 and i'm still enjoying myself, i'd say 3+ because the most violent thing is when things die they fall over into a poof of smoke, if your child is younger be careful that they don't go on servers as this could lead to it being potentially innaprorpiate, but other then that its amazing, the limit is your imagination! If you install mods the possibilities increase even more (if the device is older it might not be able to handle mods + mods are java edition only!). With certain websites you can even make your own servers, or if you have friends roudn you can play together on a mini server hosted on your internet (only people connected to your internet can join), overall its a very very fun game which I highly recommend."
1751,8,"-Minecraft is an amazing sandbox style game that encourages creativity and helps a LOT in learning . Although, if your child  is 6-7 yrs old, I suggest NOT to use multiplayer mode. If your child is scared , or may feel uncomfortable with monsters in the game, you can change it to peaceful mode. Also, in creative mode, you have all resources, and can build anything! This is why Minecraft is excellent for kids 6+"
1752,8,"-I will now say my recomendations for parents.  When your kid starts playing the game, i recommend that it starts to play in creative mode, to get a ""spice"" of the game. Creative mode lets you build what you want, get unlimited items, so, the player will not have to survive. I also recommend giving them a guide (they are online). Let them play creative mode for 1 week-  1 month until they become ""good"" to the game. When they start playing survival, get them a guide. If you not, your child will probably start saying ""How i craft ..."" and ""WHY A ZOMBIE KILLS ME EVERYTIME?"" every 5-10 minutes. And whats going to happen is that they will be playing the game for about 1 month AND STILL have made no progress. Why? Because to progress in minecraft is hidden. Thats why you need a guide. Your child in 1 month will have crafted 0 items and will die every 5 minutes. The hidden progression (that is never explained in the game, there is no tutorial!) is: Get wood > Get crafting table > get a sword > get more items."
1753,8,"-You can build anything you like, you can do everything! it powers imagination, I say you should get this for your son/daughter at 6 to 15, yes, to 15!"
1754,8,"-Personally, I think Minecraft is AMAZING!!   I have been playing it for a week already and I  am addicted to it!!    "
1755,8,"-The game Minecraft, is very mild and fun for the whole family. The game costs seven dollars. It is a very fun came, but it may cause some friction, and frustration. The only violence is  when your character slashes a sword at a pixalated zombie or spider. Minecraft definitly lost it's popularity, but it's still fun. I also completely disagree with it's E10+ rating. Minecraft is the perfect game for your child, definitly consider it for a Hannucha, Christmas, or Birthday gift."
1756,8,"-I first got this game when I was about 9 years old, and I was stunned at how awesome it truly was. It is more of a sandbox game than anything else, but it is made well. If you do not have this game already, I would recommend that you buy it right now. It endorses imagination, as it allows you to build anything you'd like (In fact, in some schools in Sweden, it is taught as a mandatory subject in school). This game fosters creativity and is a great way for children to express themselves and build great things. They can even make things like machines with redstone. There is a bit of violence, though - you can kill monsters, animals, and other players, but it is not overly graphic or over-the-top."
1757,8,-Obviously you can build anything you want unless your in survivial mode you would have repeat getting more material so you can have  ♾ Blocks by being in creative
1758,8,-ITS GREAT ITS A LEGEND
1759,8,"-It is agreat game with a lot of possibilities for what to do, but it gets old and boring after awhile. Common sense media over exaggerated about the learning and positive role models."
1760,8,"-It's a fun game. Kids can build and create their own worlds.caution, if you give this app to your kids,they will play it for hours. It encourages creativity."
1761,8,-Addictive and fun
1762,8,"-This is Quality! Buy it! People dont buy it cuz it costs $26.95, but it is worth it! The Educational value shows kids how to survive the wild! (dont punch trees with ur hand) It also shows you how to be creative! The minecraft developers are funny and cool. Easter Eggs are everywhere! Same with April fools jokes! This is a funny and cool game and i reccomend any Parent buying this! The Graphics are awesome! News and updates get better and better! This is the best game on the market. Also, The Community is so friendly! No account hackers, Not as many bullies as roblox,and no online daters! This is amazing!"
1763,8,"-This game is super simplistic and tons of fun! It fosters creativity by allowing kids to build in a sandbox with limitless possibilities. I see a lot of parents here complaining about mods and online interactions. Mods can only be installed through the PC version and take quite a bit of effort. So ""sex"" and ""gun"" mods shouldn't be an issue. As for online, people are jerks. That's unavoidable. "
1764,8,"-not too bad although i mean for those who are christians it has some probably can be called demonic contents and relationship with satan,demons and the antichrist.How do i know well on youtube and the game you can see some bad things ,like what?well if you play at 3am on pocket edition(not sure of other versions)you will see some demons and the antichrist sign i had it before i and my bro were so into it,i told my friends about it they were enchanted what's my well later i deleted it"
1765,8,-I think the game is safe for 8 year olds. Maybe 7. The game has some violence such as hitting/killing animals or mobs.  It teaches you about survival and gathering food out in the wilderness. It also is great for building and planning things. I use it to build and design houses and buildings.
1766,8,"-In multiplayer,you can get bad words in chat,  but you can also get positive messages.  Everything can happen with modifications.  You can also accecedentally say some private informations."
1767,8,"-It's one of my favorite video games and I think it's really creative.  I'm just going to warn people, it does have a lot of violence.  It's not really a bad kind of violence, because you're technically killing to survive.  It's good."
1768,8,"-Minecraft is a Mojang created blocky graphics building simulator in which the player survives against hostile mobs, hunger, and the environment. The violence in this game consists of using weaponry such as pick axes, swords, Bows, axes, and other material you find around the world.  There is no blood or gore unless one  downloads a mod that imports such content. Minecraft also does not have foul language unless the player is in multiplayer online mode where other players can interact with each other, sometimes using foul language. Some of the foul language consists of the words cock, dick, fuck, and ass plus others etc. Players also can make custom skins for themselves which can be revealing showing body parts such as boobs, penises, and butts. There is also  potion brewing in the game where certain potions can poison you or slow your speed. Also when eating a puffer fish in the game your screen will blur and life will go down simulating a drug-like effect. Parents should also be concerned about privacy as people have been hacked. Overall my rating for minecraft would be "
1769,8,"-This game is amazing. There really is no violence aside form killing animals, players, or hostile mobs but it's not graphic. Players can play the game without anyone or anything to kill. This game encourages you to be creative. Minecraft is the type of game that anyone can sit down and enjoy."
1770,8,"-Besides the PC version, other versions are boring, like Minecraft PE, Minecraft W10, etc."
1771,8,"-Maybe you have thought about building an house from scratch.. Yet you have no bricks, you may have thought another time about surving in the wild .. Yet your too scared to take the risk. Ladies and Gentlemen a solution has been found and even better you can achieve anything you want on one single video game ... Minecraft is a fun, creative and fantastic way to bring out your creative side, no matter who you are and what age you maybe, Minecraft will bring a smile to your face, this one single game gives you the option to create what ever you want from as simple as a brick house or as extravagant as a Iron Spaceship. Not your cup of tea? Minecraft offers a survival mode and so from a click of a button, your are based  with nothing and are left to fund for your self in the wild. The game is compatible on just about anything from the comfort of your home computer to your portible tablets and mobile phones. Overally, I think this game rocks and I recommend it to anyone who is willing to pay It's amazingly cheap price. My hat off to Mojang and the other publishers of this game. FANTASTIC"
1772,8,"-It's fantastic. Creative mode is perfect for building anything, from the Empire State Building to a small cottage. Survival is, in my opinion, slightly more violent, as there are monsters. There is a Peaceful mode, though, so you can always turn them off. In Survival, you need to gather your resources by mining and stuff. People from 7 year olds to adults will love the creativity. Parents can play with their kids, too. In multiplayer servers, players can act badly, but the best and most popular servers have a reporting system. I don't think parents should let their kids on Multiplayer until they're at least 10 though.  All in all, it's stupendous. Play it!"
1773,8,"-An open world, sandbox game that is randomly generated. ... The game also features a creative mode, where the player is invincible, has an unlimited supply of everything, can fly, and break blocks easily. Welcome to Minecraft, A World where you can do anything.(Google Summary) Minecraft offers two worlds-Survival and Creative. In Creative you have no lives, build anything, discover villages, fly and more! Survival is a little more tricky you are given 10 hearts and need to collect things for a shelter, food and escape monsters who could kill. I would worry a little about safety and privacy because you can interact with other people online. There;s a LOT of consumerism like T-shirts, movies, books, and other things.  Yet it's very easy to play and I would suggest playing a lot! Set a time limit though because it's very addicting building things! Minecraft is a great game for any video game users!"
1774,8,"-It is amazing! I can discover new things every day like the nether and end, build buildings, and go on survival adventures and see how long i can live. Also, there are wonderful servers with many enjoyable games. Plus, your friends can play with you whether you are playing in a server or in one of your own worlds. I enjoy customizing and looking for new skins that I will wear. SO MUCH FUN!"
1775,8,-Minecraft is a mildly violent video game that inspires kids creativity through building in creative mode. Survival mode allows players to fight monsters and upgrade and craft various items. However there is the ability to play with other players on servers or play on local wifi network games called LAN
1776,8,"-This game is so fun you can play it on a PC, laptop, Xbox 360,  Mobile, Xbox One, PS3, PS4, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch. no matter what console or other device you own Minecraft is awesome although there tends to be a bit of violence but there's not any blood or gore in it and just a great game in general"
1777,8,-great game! In the game you really have to use your mind. they should have called it mind craft ha ha ha! just joking! for mums and dads don't really have to know about the game. check with your mum and dad before buying the game.
1778,8,-AWESOME
1779,8,"-This game is horrible as itself. The survival is fun at first (go to the minecraft wiki for help on crafting recipes), but it devolves into mining for hours on end. The creative is good, but due to the blocky nature of the game it takes thousands of blocks to create a realistic build that looks good, and said build is ginormous, so having friends to help is essential. However, this is where the game gets fun. You see, Notch didn't say you couldn't mess with the game, you just can't sell it illegally. The result, Thousands, hundreds of thousands of mods that CHANGE your game to whatever you want. Adding armor, blocks, dimensions, anything at all! You want it, there's a mod for it. And if you're the creative kind of guy, download WorldEdit, helping you build faster using commands. Then there's the multiplayer. Avoid faction servers unless they are really new, unless you like dying to people wearing enchanted diamond armor (absolute best armor in the game, unless you have a mod with better armor). And most people who play on such servers are 6 year olds who think it's cool to swear like the devil himself, and the game doesn't have a default sensor system.  But other servers have plug-ins (multiplayer version of mods) that completely change the game to something else. Popular game-modes are Ghostcraft (basically the hidden in minecraft), survival games is a classic (hungergames), Trouble in minevile (trouble in terrorist town), and minez (dayz). The current craze is supercraftbros (supersmashbros in minecraft)."
1780,8,"-This is the best PC game ever invented!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The only thing to worry about is some semi-creepy monsters that try to hunt you down and kill you. If your child doesn't like long games, don't introduce them to it. You must collect lots of materials, some of them taking a long time to collect. WARNING: To make certain things you must know the combinations to put them in. It is best to know someone who has lots of experience with minecraft."
1781,8,-This game is great for any child teen or adult. It involves lots of fun learning that can be had. For on e the game is 100% customizable. With using mods and resource packs. You can do anything from changing the way dirt looks to getting a pet cat and naming it nemo! You can also change the way you look with minecraft.novaskin.me and many other fun and exciting things. Although a visit to youtube with be needed to help. I'd suggest looking at TheDiamondMinecart for help.
1782,8,-This game is the one that got me into gaming! It's a sandbox and open world game and there is a very loose story in the form of going to the nether and then the end. It's all about exploring and finding the items needed to survive. There is a massive community and a lot of public servers but be carefull as some server are cracked and can take your password and username. Trolls and griefers are also a problem on public servers there are however nice servers out there and most servers will ban griefers. Also a nother thing is it's addticting nature of the game as I am at school for 8-9 hours a day and during term time I never had time for minecraft but during the hoildays that would shoot up to 8-9 hours ON minecraft a day I have gotten over it now but I would tell parnets to watch their childs play time on minecraft. There is also a massive modding community and a look though some of the mods is a good idea. Over all it's a great game and is worth every penny.
1783,8,-When everyone is says NOT FOR KIDS probably millions of kids from 4-at least 50 I personally love the game it is a game of blocks where you can
1784,8,-awesome game better than roblox it doesnt have sex profanity etc
1785,8,-Haha! This is fun! 
1786,8,-get mine craft its worth every penny GET IT!!
1787,8,"-I like to play Minecraft whenever I have the time to. You can craft and mine and do lots of other things. And you could learn stuff from it to. You can learn to craft and smelt things like how i learnt that glass is made from sand. You also explore caves and kill zombies and other creatures. And there is no blood. But It's so addicting that there is 16,000,000 and more players."
1788,3,-I loved this movie but it is definitely a PreTeen movie.
1789,3,"-I didn't really like this movie. I mean the love story was cute and everything, but the plot seems very plain and simple. Al least to me. Fine for kids, there is  nothing confusing about the plot. It's very simple. One thing I found annoying was the dialogue, for some reason it seemed very very cheesy to me. ."
1790,3,"-It is a great movie, although it has a little bit of violence in it. That is the only reason i chose 8 and up."
1791,3,-i tried to watch this movie and couldn't even sit though it all. it's so cliche that it's disturbing...
1792,3,-Contins some fantasy action and mild rude humor.
1793,3,"-This film sends out an importanat message that judging someone by their appearence is not OK, and that greed and beeing vain won't get you very far in life."
1794,3,-I love this film! It's great that snow white gets to be the fighter for once! Snow white is really pretty! ^.^
1795,3,"-It wasn't very good, I was definitely dissappointed. It was boring for older kids and adults, yet contained lots of dirty humor that was not appropriate for younger ages. Not even worth a dollar at Redbox."
1796,3,"-in one point the prince pounces on the queen and licks her face,also the dwarfs will start trying to kill each other with weapons (drunk). the 5 year old i was babysitting seemed to like it. this is a very good movie at the end the prince and snow white seal there love with a kiss.good for kids 5 and up probaly."
1797,3,-I think it was a little violent but I'm a girl and 10 and to me it was fine. I reccomend being 9 to watch. Just because it might be hard to understand.
1798,8,"-I think Misery was a great movie, but there is too much profanity. LANGUAGE: There are several uses of S--t  one use of F--k and words like dirty bird from Annie. Paul writes f--k in a type writer about 6 times. Paul also flips Annie the bird once.  DRINKING DRUGS AND SMOKING: Annie consistently drugs Paul and there is several scenes with smoking. Wine is drank in 1 scene. VIOLENCE: There is a lot of violence in this film. The movie starts out with a car crash. At the end there is a pretty brutal fight scene.(they are hitting each other with anvil type things) The movie is pretty creepy overall. Annie shows up standing up by his bed when he is sleeping. She breaks both of his ankles. Overall this movie is great and I think a mature 11-12 year old can handle it."
1799,8,-I watched this movie a while ago and I did find it to be a little disturbing and pretty dang unsettling but it wasn't that bad. There was some language as well like a middle finger and one spoken f word and c*** sucker is said once as well. The sledgehammer scene was also very disturbing and had unsettling music in the background but I say that 13 and up can see this movie and maybe a mature 12 year old.
1800,8,-Sex 2/10
1801,8,-It was very well written a chilling movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat but be warned this movie WILL give you nightmares
1802,8,"-This movie is definatly not appropriate for any children under 15 or 14. It is not as much scary as violent. Paul Sheldon as the bones in his feet broken and one of them is onscreen (he screams) and the ending fight is very violent. Their is also some language and 1 finger but like I said this is not for kids. Reviews on here say its okay for 10 year olds. Definatly not. As far as how good the movie itself is, it is good but not as good as the book (which kids shouldn't read eathir) but Kathy Bates preforms her role very well and plays Annie Wilkes great."
1803,8,"-I watched this movie when i was 11 and i was fine, but i was also watching slashers at that age."
1804,8,-Brief strong violence with some swearing. Nowhere near as violent (and profanity filled) as most of his other movies. This is an amazing movie that's good for kids 12 and up (or younger if violence doesn't disturb them and they don't repeat some of the words) because this is one many Stephen King movies that isn't scary.
1805,8,"-This movie was fine, but not my favorite. It had some language, but it was pretty mild R with only a few F words. The movie does have a few scenes of violence mostly towards the end, but there is one scene in the middle that is extremely tough to watch, and not for the squeamish. In this scene a woman puts a wooden block in between his legs next to his ankles, and breaks them with a sledge hammer, and this is the most hard to watch scene. This whole movie is very intense and scary, but I think a mature ten cold handle it if they don't see the ankle scene"
1806,8,-I watched this movie last night and Im 9 some parts are violent but its suitable for 9 and up. The hammer scene was a bit graphic though.
1807,5,-Miss Persona is so funny! She dresses up as all sorts of fun people! And she also helps her friends by dressing up! Its a really cool tv show to sum it up.
1808,5,"-Moana is an excellent movie! There are strong, positive role models and even the negative ones (I mean Maui) become good role models and make up for their mistakes towards the end. This movie has some scares, but kids ages 6 or 7 and up should be able to handle it. There is some potty language (typical for kids movies) but it doesn’t go beyond appropriate. The music here is also wonderful. This is a great movie for kids and I recommend watching it!"
1809,5,-To much singing if you hate it when ur kids sing the song for ages the don’t watch if not then 10 out of 10 would lemur again
1810,5,"-I loved Moana. It is very beautiful and entertaining. I recommend for ages 6 and older because some scenes can be potentially frightening for younger viewers. However, it is very wonderful."
1811,5,"-I put 4 and up because there really isn't a reason a four year old shouldn't watch this. Honestly I think even if you have a kid that is three or younger, it'd be fine. I just wasn't sure because there is a part with kind of like a lava fire monster lady thing. She didn't come off as too scary to me (although I am 15) so I have no idea how your 2 year old would react to someone throwing fireballs and being made out of lava and rock. Other than that the movie is great! Moana is such a wholesome Disney princess! She's got a great attitude and for once I love where the storyline isn't about finding a prince. Great movie and the songs are beautiful. Oh also I wouldn't show your kids this (no matter their age) if someone in the family just passed. In this movie Moanas grandmother dies (sorry spoiler) and it is sad. Moanas grandmother dies peacefully though!"
1812,5,"-Moana is a movie about a young woman who ventures outside of her island in order to restore the heart to a goddess. It has great messages because it shows how you sometimes have to have courage to do what is right, even if everybody else is doing wrong. The great role models are Moana and Maui. Moana is a couragous and brave leader who goes on a daring quest to restore peace. Maui helps Moana along her quest, even though he is the one that caused everything to be destroyed in the first place. It has some violence and some creatures and monsters that could be frightening for young kids. There is a lava monster who eventually turns into the goddess as well as a giant crab and coconut pirates with weapons. There are some thunderstorms and lightening that happen while Moana is out on the ocean, which could also be scary. It is worth noting that while Moana is a kid-friendly movie, most of the female characters wear skirts and a bikini top and all of the males wear just skirts. The women who aren't wearing skirts and bikini tops are wearing revealing dresses, so you might want to consider that. Some mild language is used, but nothing that would be extremely inappropraite for a ten-year-old, as long as they know not to repeat it. There are a few scenes where Maui tells Moana that she is going to get killed, and one where he says that the entrance to the crab's palace won't appear 'unless he makes a human sacrafice.' Moana also says inappropriate things throughout the movie, some near-swear-words, but no actual swear words. Moana's grandmother dies in the beginning of the movie, though it is not shown on-screen. It is also shown how Moana's father's friend drowned in the ocean when he was a young man. There is also a scene at the beginning of the movie that shows a man being forced to get a painful tattoo. Another thing is that all of the adult characters have tattoos, and I wasn't a huge fan of how it promoted tattoos, especially in that first scene. Maui also goes to the bathroom in the water and leaves Moana to feel the water afterwards, and that part was very gross. If there wasn't as much violence or innappropriate content, I would reccommend this movie for ages six and up. No consumerism or innappropriate substances are present. Overall, Moana is a great animated movie and is one of my favorite animated movies of all time,  but I would highly reccommend it for ages ten and older only. It was marketed as a kid-friendly movie, but I see it as a movie more for tweens and older kids."
1813,5,-Good. Some funny parts like the dart put in Maui's potty-private part. And positive models. You have to see this. You might even give it 5 stars*****! Really good movie. I'd probably rate it 5+.
1814,5,-Well it is good but I saw a bit of disqusting things but it was only one.
1815,5,"-He was heralded as the first and only WWE member and it turned out he was actually a Hawaiian demigod. His name was “Maui” and he got his powers from a magic hook. He gave humans many gifts, and decided to steal life magic from the island lady. It turns out that was a bad idea, and he was attacked by the lava guy. Oops. But then he meets Moan, who is a princess from a village, and she’s like “give the life thing back to the island lady”. So Maui’s like “No” but then he’s like “ok”, so it’s gucci. But Maui doesn’t have the life thingy, so they have to get it from a shiny crab man named Tomato. They almost die, but then Moan get’s the life thingy. Oh yeah, there's also an immortal chicken. Then they  go to fight the lava guy, but Maui’s hook get’s broke. Then Maui is like “I’m sad”. Moan is like “I am Moan”. Then she goes to fight the lava guy again. Oh, and the ocean is sentient, so… anyway, she goes to fight the lava guy again. Maui comes back and helps.(DONT READ AHEAD IF U DONT WANT SPOILERS) Then, ooo, plot twist, the lava guy is the island girl but without the life thingy. The the island girl gives maui a new hook cuz he broke his. Moan’s village gets saved, and they become sea-travelers again. The end. Or is it. Moan 2 coming to theaters in 1995."
1816,5,-I liked this film because of the courage this film shows. The music was good in the film and it is very entertaining but the movie is kind of violent so I think it is ok for People 8 and up
1817,5,-Moana is great.  I liked the singing.  There are some parts that are scary. It's a funny movie because of Hehe and Pua; they're so great.
1818,8,-Took the 3yo goddaughter to see this today at PimmiPlayHouse a place that plays movies that have already left the theater. She was alarmed by the sea crab and asked to leave. I had already seen the movie and obliged to leave because she was crying.  I think she was just too young for it. Maybe in a couple of years we'll try this movie again.
1819,8,"-Moana is really good for any children wanting an adventurous movie with a female main character. There are lots of great songs and I really think Moana and Maui are good role models for little children. They don't give up, or at least they come back to face the problem. It was a little scary foy my younger brother, but otherwise it is great in every way."
1820,8,-I thought that it was very predictable but over all it was pretty sweet.
1821,8,-the movie is ok but on here you cant watch it
1822,8,"-Moana is an awesome movie! Moana, Maui, and other characters show role models that other people should follow. Also, children can get a feel for ancient Polynesian culture. Other than that, the movie is curious, thrilling, and just hilarious!"
1823,8,-your kids will drown in boredom. Oh ya ps the star actor is World Wrestling Champion(the rock).
1824,8,"-This is a Disney movie that is filled with bravery.  A young girl, named Moana, sets off on a boat to save her island.   She meets a demigod named Maui, and they journey and they meet a crab,and a huge lava monster.  They are fun, catchy songs, that are appropriate for kids.  The language is not bad at all, but they are some violent scenes.Hope this review was good!"
1825,8,-so good! great for families.
1826,8,"-Great animation film about a heroic girl who seeks for adventure ! It's perfect for kids and families , has great music and good visual. Has some scary moments, but nothing too intense . It's one of the best animation films of the year and its nominated for two Oscars ."
1827,8,"-It has good music, humor,anamation,characters"
1828,5,"-Before reading, I'd like you to know that I tried not to put any spoilers in my review. Happy reading! I recently watched this movie for the first time. I didn't think I'd like it as much as I did. The visuals are pretty good. Everything looks pretty realistic. I think it was kind of funny. The monsters may scare young children. There were some insults, though. There are some great messages families can have talks about. Same with the great role-models. I hope you see this movie and thank you for reading!"
1829,5,-Yeh language warning my a**
1830,5,"-I really enjoyed it. I think it's great to watch it with family, but it's a little  "
1831,5,"-Monsters, Inc is a good movie but they scenes get wild, such as"
1832,5,"-I enjoyed watching Mike and Sully  go to new places, communicate with different characters and  fight off the main baddies."
1833,5,-Sorry about commensense media forgot things.
1834,5,-The movie is about monsters. They're trying to make electricity. The movie was about getting the baby home.
1835,8,-abc easy as 123 this show is literally broken
1836,8,"-I was traumatized when I first saw it, and it still creeps me out for some reason."
1837,8,"-Its a very funny movie that does not need to be rated PG-13. I watched it when I was 10 and my sister who is 9 saw it at 8. It has a good message and good acting. There are some swear words and a few mildly inappropriate references but its not that bad, and it will easily go over younger peoples head. Its very funny and I recommender for families!"
1838,8,"-This is a great movie for everyone to watch, whether or not they have gone through a divorce, because it is absolutely hilarious and lets the kids know that even if the parents don’t love each other anymore, they still love them. I say 10+ for language, some sexual jokes, and brief arguing/yelling."
1839,8,"-This film, is really good, I'm being honest, it's my 3rd favorite movie behind Schindler's List and Jurassic Park. But, just like with those other two films, Mrs. Doubtfire is one of the greatest films of 1993, and it does a good job on setting you up in an emotional place. For example, there are some times throughout the film, where you are probably laughing so hard where you can't breath, or some times where you cry feeling emotional due to how the characters feel. Because, the plot of the story is emotional which shows a couple being divorced and the dad disguises himself thanks to his brother, and it's actually a good idea for a comedy-drama film. However, I can not let this movie go without adding some critique to it, OK so let's start with the fact that there is a few sexual references throughout the movie, but that's why it's got the PG-13 rating, and a majority of them will probably go over kids' heads. Also, for a Robin Williams comedy, there is a lot of language, the website says that there was an F word in the film, but I watched the movie twice and I did not hear any F bombs in it. This is a very good movie, it's understandable of making 2nd place at the box office during the time it was released, and this is a good movie for 11+, but anyone under than that should definitely have a parent or guardian with them."
1840,8,-This movie is hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing. The father of 3 kids dresses up as a nanny to be with his kids. He faces many obstacles that are very funny to watch. A Great  family pick for some good laughs.
1841,8,"-Every kid of every age will find this movie funny, though kids of 11 will probably get the jokes. it is a delightful look at what happens when a divorced father pretends to be a prim English nurse. Some inexplicably vulgar sexual content when he overtly quizzes the mother on her sex life, and warns Stu (Pierce Brosnan) about some of her sex life. Occasional sex jokes, but mostly a family movie. Robin Williams is cute and very good at imitations, Harvey Fierstein is consistently entertaining, and Sally Field provides a relieving gravitas. Definitely recommended!"
1842,8,-Great movie for families very very very funny. I highly recommend it.
1843,8,-I remember when i first watched this movie didn't really understand it but i watched it again a few years later and loved it!
1844,8,"-This movie was hallarious but did have words such as motherf..ker,s..t,ass,and much more."
1845,8,"-Why do I say this? Well to begin, the acting is truly amazing, the battle scenes are epic, and the movie has an overall pretty cool vibe to it."
1846,8,-I am  a girl and 12. I think that this movie is not as violent as it might seem. When I first read all the comments and reviews I was worried if it was appropriate for me but when I watched the movie I found that it wasn't that scary at all. There isn't any inappropriate scenes for younger viewers. It is very entertaining and inspiring. A great movie for 9 up.
1847,8,"-I thought it was good!!! Most people are stewing about the bathing scene, but it was shown in a clever and nonsexual way and I thought it wasn’t much of an issue. Barely any profanities and not much violence. It showed female strength and that was one of the best parts!!! I would totally recommend!"
1848,8,-I really don’t know why everyone says this isn’t a great movie. I watched it right when it came out and it was way better than I expected. There isn’t much violence and the characters are really well played. If you are thinking of watching this I highly recommend it.
1849,8,-Honestly the nudity was probably worse than the violence but just so you know this is the violence: 1 The worst violence scene is the final fight scene *SPOILER SPOILER*
1850,8,"-It's a fine movie, but it subtracts one of the main charectors, Mushu."
1851,8,"-The movie was Very good.  I think that kids can watch this because she's only throwing them around, there is no blood, even when she stabs them, no blood on the sword, Positive role model for girls. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is they took the dragon out! He was funny."
1852,8,-Mulan 2020 is really not as bad people say. I really enjoyed watching this movie as it was exciting. I would say for kids 11 up because there was quite a bit of violence which could scare younger children. I would recommend
1853,8,"-I loved this movie so much and I think its a great message for kids about womans strength and power. It was very attention grabbing and I honestly don't understand why so many people dislike this movie. Well, yes there is a few pieces of the cartoon movie that aren't in the live action, but I reckon it makes it better because its more realistic and there is a whole new character in this movie that gets rid of the dissapointment that mushu doesn't show up. Thanks for reading my review if you have gotten this far, I %100 reccomend!"
1854,6,-My favourite film of all time been watching it since I was 5 years old 
1855,6,"-This movie is wayyyyyy better then the remake, watch this one instead!"
1856,6,"-Honestly this movie is just amazing all around. Great messages for kids, great characters, actual drama and emotion, and great music. It does get a bit dark at points, but doesn't have anything too graphic."
1857,6,-The only thing I would object to in this film is the nudity when Mulan is bathing but the men come there too. Otherwise a great film with great role models!
1858,6,"-Mulan is one of my favorite movies. It shows a strong independent woman who helps fight for her country. I think it’s great for 5+ because it has a happy ending, and I personally don’t think the fight scenes are very intense. AWESOME MOVIE! GO WATCH IT!"
1859,6,"-It's a great Disney movie but it's story is misleading as like Pocahontas before it, it suffers from being very inaccurate. But I don't blame Disney for sugar coating this movie as the real Mulan committed suicide after her service because she was going to be made a concubine. I will say that other than being watered down into a fantasy adventure film is really good and there is comic relief. That's a story about Asian people. Mulan is a one of the great role models for children, and she is worth for fighting for. She doesn't want her father to go to war like a military and she becomes strong. She takes her father's place. Also, a 16 year old girl like other Disney Princesses such as Aurora, Moana, Ariel, and Merida. Mulan is the first place most good Disney Princess. Though it has war violence like there's too many Hun army to destroy Shangs in the mountains. We have 2,000 Huns (4,000 of them in real life). I don't know why there is so many Hun soldiers who want to take over China. There is a village called “Tung Shao Pass” that was destroyed by the Huns. There is high body count (you can see dead soldiers and horses especially the poor little girl who lost her Lilo doll). A main antagonist, Shan-Yu invades Chinese castle and he passed away in the fireworks bomb. Shan-Yu is one of the underrated Disney Villains but Mulan's a Disney masterpiece. Some people are not allowed to coloring their scleras because it's really painful for your eyes. Shan-Yu has black ink on his eyes, that makes him scary, and looks like he's having a night vision. I forgot that he has “sith eyes”. I have sensitive eyes but I couldn't stop thinking about him when I was 9 and I wish I had to change my eye color with powers. I'm so obsessed with Mulan at the age of 9 and I really want to try to watch it. Okay, also worth noting that there's some sexual jokes in the movie and a very akward skinny dipping/bathing scene in which you see Yao standing up on a rock in front of Mulan. The viewer doesn't see anything but it's implied that Mulan did as she tells Mushu that she ""never wants to see a naked guy ever again"" at which point a bunch of nude men run past. Has plenty of jokes that might go over the kids heads but will keep grown ups laughing. Even, Li-Shang's back is shown and Mulan gets stunned. Li-Shang looks so hot though. “Let's get down to business to defeat the Huns” is going to be acronym for “LGBT” and some theorists think that Shang is gay or Bisexual. It has funny scenes like the Matchmaker's butt becomes fire fart, Mushu is being Batman, and some scenes are funny. I have an only problem that Mulan is having a big ears and that's too funny for the Disney Princess films. There is also Shan-Yu is thicc (I bet that he may be thicc as Thanos, you Mulan fans may find it funny). I couldn't stop laughing! Some fans may complain that Shan-Yu being attractive! I don't think so! So, anyways! The Animation is great and stunning, great characters, and amazing plot. That's a historical inaccurate but the Disney movie made the original legend even better! I recommend for ages 5 or 6. Great job, Disney! Though I will be 15 to see a release date of live action Mulan, it has different characters, different plot, and it will release Aug 21, 2020. Maybe fans of animated Mulan will might be disappointed."
1860,6,-So I LOVEEE this movie but there is a LOTTA  VIOLENCE
1861,6,-
1862,8,-This was the first muppets movie I ever watched and I loved it! The muppets are one of my favorite movie franchise's.
1863,8,-Really Good. Not Much to Say. No Content. Does have positve messages and role models though.
1864,8,"-It's such a good Muppet movie, as they all are. One of the best!"
1865,8,"-This sequel is certainly more intense and has a lot more action and suggestive moments then the first. Kids should be older, and it will not appeal to crowds older then 13. "
1866,8,"-For longtime Muppet fans, this movie will entertain and excite. For younger children, they may be frightened by some scenes, but the action is more entertaining than straight-up horror-style. "
1867,8,-It is super good but there are some loud scenes where they are breaking in  and it is a really good movie.
1868,8,-I watched this when it came out a long time ago and it was SUPER scary. I think I can handle it now though :).
1869,8,"-This is the worst movie I have seen in ages. Way to scary for muppet loving kids. The person who came up with the idea of this Horror (yes, I said it. Horror.) movie is nuts. Mad."
1870,8,"-This is what you get if you mixed who framed roger rabbit with the great muppet caper. ""Oh it's too dark"", did you read the plot before seeing this movie. My then 3 year old cousin (now 5) saw this with me on opening day, and she actually enjoyed it. This movie delivers a message about honesty (Kermit tries to tell the truth that he's not Constantine)."
1871,8,-My rating:PG for violence.
1872,7,-Mild violence
1873,7,"-This Muppet sequel doesn't reach it's high standards as the 2011 film, but it is great just the way it is. This movie brings a lot of heart and gags that I am sure are capable of entertaining people of all ages. This movie is good for all ages, even little ones."
1874,7,-Hilarious! Perfect for all kids but some may not understand all the jokes. The reason I didn't give it a higher rating was because I almost fell asleep during the film.
1875,7,-i wanted to see this movie when it came out. i liked the first one a little better.
1876,7,"-While not without its flaws, this muppet film is a great one, with a nice caper plot, and some great writting. Though some of the characters are off with Fozzie being dumb, the gang not recognizing the difference between a frog, and their friend of four decades, and a in your face moral followindg the climax, it still manages to hold up, with some great songs, a really good plot, and the pairing of Sam the Eagle and Ty Burrell is one of the film's strong points. For kids there are some violent scenes including explosions and bombs that might scare them, and not much else that would be inappropriate for kids. Overal, great film, and an improvement on its more human focused predecessor."
1877,7,"-My mother took me and my two younger brothers (10 and 8), despite my refusals. The advertisements seemed to bore me and really didn't grab my attention. It wasn't worth the eight dollars per ticket. I understood the humor, but I still didn't like the movie. Maybe it is just me, but talking muppets really don't grab the attention of an adolescent. "
1878,7,-This movie is not as great as the first and money wasting
1879,7,"-Not as good as The Muppets which I really adore, but still worth watching. It has some funny scenes. The cameo appearances was a surprise. Ricky Gervais was good, Tina Fey was funny, but for me, Ty Burrell stole the show with Sam The Eagle. They were hilarious. At least the songs were catchy."
1880,7,"-Truly I thought it was good.  It has a lesson in it don't judge a book by its cover because Kermit was taken to jail because he looked like the bad frog in the movie also there were great messages in the movie but only a few bad words like butt, stupid, ect.  So truly in think you and your family should watch this movie together.  It's great for family movie night!"
1881,7,-Do you like unpredictable movies? Do you like movie that makes  you jump? If so you would  love the muppets most wanted. I rate it 4 stars it is good for 6 year olds and up! There is some parts in the movie that makes you jump! If you are looking for a quiet movie this is not right movie to go to. There is lot of famous characters like for  example Ross Lynch from Austin and Ally and a ton more that you might know.  It is a pg movie once again I rate it 4 stars out of 5 star!
1882,8,-I LOVED this movie when I was little and I still do. It’s great for young and sensitive kids because the violence is minimal and most of the story revolves around the Totoro and his friends.
1883,8,"-This is an adorable movie that me and my younger sister loved!! Totoro is super nice, he tries to cheer up the girls when their mom doesn't come home from the hospital, and he stands with them in the rain while the girls wait for their dad to come home. Satski goes looking everywhere for her sister, showing positive roll models and good messages. There are some little ghost things called soot sprites which maybe be sort of creepy for kids under the age of 3. But otherwise I loved it! Didn't know Dakota Fanning was in it either!!!"
1884,8,-Despite the popularity of the movie I didn’t find it very good. The plot wasn’t super interesting but I find it’s more for younger viewers.
1885,8,-Was a bit bored for the first 20 minutes but I ended up really enjoying it.
1886,8,-its awsome but people always say the bath scene inappropriate should not be in movie NO LIKE SHUT UR MOUTH PEOPLE! back then people did not have a hot water so they had to heat it up and that took long and was a lot of work thats why
1887,8,"-Every time I see chubby bunny rat it scares me. Especially on the cover, the way it’s eyes are opened wide and it’s half way in the shade!!! And the MOUTH!!! AHHH so scary would CERTAINLY freak out little kids."
1888,8,-MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO is a Japanese film for kids and doesn't contain anything bad.
1889,8,"-I and all my family, LOVE this movie! It is great! I think it’s awesome because it has a great positive message, and it shows two girls that are sisters, that moved to a different place, and only with their dad because Their mom, is in the hospital. It doesn’t show anything scary, about the mom being in the hospital, because, she’s just a little sick. Though I do think parents should know, is that, there’s one part where the older sister is afraid her mom will get really sick, and something will happen to her, and she’ll die, but it’s appropriate and not scary at all, even for little kids,"
1890,8,"-I feel that this movie is a whimsical introduction to Studio Ghibli, along with Kiki's Delivery Service and The Cat Returns. It tells a heartwarming story and the main characters are beyond relatable to a pair of siblings. However, there is the plot point of Satsuki and Mei's mother, Yasuko. In the movie, Yasuko has tuberculosis, and when her condition becomes more critical, Mei runs away from home. Some say this scene is a gives the movie a deceptive twist that scared their children and ruined the movie. You know what else is deceptive? Tuberculosis/ terminal illness. You need to explain what is going on if your child asks, and ask them if they understand. If you keep this information from them, they'll learn further in the future and it would be much more traumatic. You shouldn't lie to your kids, because if they wholly believe your lies, you'll come off as untrustworthy to your kids, and it would mess them up further, later. So teach your kid what's going on, if they need to know. It'll work better eventually. Knowledge is power!"
1891,8,"-its very, very, very, very,great.its the best movie ever."
1892,8,"-Very good movie, for babies, kids, tweens, teens and adults!"
1893,8,"-Well Spirited Away, it looks like you're finally off the hook! I have now seen seven Hayao Miyazaki movies, with widely varying degrees of enjoyment. Princess Mononoke and Porco Rosso are legitimately fantastic films, animation or otherwise. Castle in the Sky is a largely enjoyable movie, bogged down with a weak 3rd act and a bloated run-time. Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind and Howl's Moving Castle both had interesting parts, but were ultimately too scattershot and tedious to be fully enjoyable. And Spirited Away was easily the most overrated and unsatisfying of the whole bunch ... until I saw My Neighbor Totoro."
1894,8,-This used to be my favroute movie when I was little now I still love it many of the characters are kind and warmhearted.
1895,8,-This film is most defiantly one of Miyazaki's best productions. A great famliy movie experience. Good for all audiences. Spectacular artwork. A beautiful film.  Mostly recommended for younger kids. A must for Young anime fans.
1896,8,"-I absolutely love this movie. It's a cute story with a deep meaning behind it. Once I figured out the meaning it kind of freaked me out. Still, it was an amazing movie with imaginative characters and beautiful animation. Spoiler: It had me thinking that the mother was about to die, and I was close to crying through it, thinking of what would happen if she died in the movie. It was so sad how Mei was  bringing the corn all the way just to give it to her mother. Overall, it's a really good movie and you should see it."
1897,8,-This Movie is The 5th Miyazaki Film I Have Watched (Out of 9) It Was Such a Cute Movie With an Amazing Story and Plot. With Breathtaking Animation I Think My Neighbor Totoro should be in the Top 5 Best Movies Ever Made.
1898,8,-Great movie!!!
1899,8,"-This a amazing film for everyone! It's funny in parts and really enjoyable. It's very creative and almost like a dream, the art/drawing is very good too. "
1900,8,-this movie is such a cute movie! And has no bad things you have to worry about.
1902,8,-Beautiful docu. That's all I can say.
1903,8,"-Gorgeous film! Really inspirational. I usually don't like documentaries (Except for the Taylor Swift one, of course) but this one is amazing!"
1904,8,"-This is an emotional, entertaining documentary about a man going through depression, who visits an octopus every day and eventually befriends it. Some kids won’t find it interesting enough to keep watching, but older kids will likely be drawn in. There’s almost nothing wrong with this movie, except the depression aspect might confuse some younger kids. Watch it!"
1905,8,"-i think the movie comes out special, but for someone the movie can be boaring, it got one sad part, but the rest is him telling about the octopus he have seen. the movie is special, and i do recommend it. wow... i learned alot."
1906,8,"-I loved this movie! It was fun and more of a documentary, but overall really good. My whole family loved it (and it's usually very hard for us to figure out what to watch)"
1907,8,"-My octopus teacher. What a life. I mean you always hear: Long live the king!. But have you heard: Long live the octopus? Have you? Ok, I didn't mean to threaten you ( Oh, yes I did), i'm sorry (not really.). (I'm actually very nice you know... can I break your Ps4?) Sooo... I regard this movie more like a documentary. It is pretty tear jerking at most times. It looks like a 1 hour long ad, but like, one of the BEST ads ever, you know. If your going watch this, your going to want to become an  scuba diver. For real. Enjoy. It's sad. And sad. And sadder. Enjoy again. No really. What are you reading. I said go. Enjoy. Oh, wait. I need to ... "
1908,8,"-Great movie. For kids interested in underwater life, about forests under the water, learning about octopuses and how they live their life under the sea. This movie also shows about how octopuses protect themselves from enemies and has zero violence except for one sad part in the movie With sharks, But aside from that the movie is really fun and really interesting and will not give any kids nightmares!"
1909,8,"-Heart-felt, though you have to be pretty rich to literally do nothing but visit an octopus for a year and a half. He has a nice house on the beach front, etc. Very good docco for kids."
1910,8,-My Octopus Teacher is a really cool/amazing movie but it gets really scary/sad at the end.my favorite part is where the octopus got on him.  My mom cried. But instead of crying I was laughing inside myself while she was crying. But overall it is a pretty good movie. It was really sweet but also stressful especially at the end.like when there was a shark chasing the octopus   But watch it if you can!!!
1911,7,"-There’s a lot of violence just heads up there’s kicking, punching, stabbing, exploding, killing, throwing, fire, heads getting chopped off. Violence 10/10 language 8/10 there’s *ss b*tch s**t d**k gruesome things 6/10 a little gross from vomiting and blood and some mean and good messages but that’s all."
1912,7,"-I loved the movie a lot! Even though there were swearing  in the movie, it didn't bother me. My parents let me watch this movie (With them). Still it's the best spy movie I've ever seen. So I'd say give the movie a shot! There is violence though, like punching and kicking and pushing a truck down a big clif."
1913,7,"-It was great!  A couple iffy things though, including how JJ threatens to kill a nine year old and said nine year old is manipulative and curses, plus the overall language and violence (gosh I make it sound bad) but I really liked it.  I feel, though, that if they toned it down a notch it could have been PG, but oh well"
1914,7,"-Parents are overreacting about this movie. This is a spy movie, and any movie that involves the government and spies and a big burly man in a serious way is not an ok way to spent your kids time. If a parent watches the trailer, checks the common sense review, and still thinks “Oh, a man gets decapitated and a kid calls an adult a d**k? Well, I’m going to 100% show that to my 9-year-old!” Then that’s just bad parenting. I get it if some parents didn’t check how old you need to be to watch this movie, but if you actually took the time afterward to write a review on this site and KNEW ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND then don’t blame the movie for being aimed at tweens, blame yourself for not reading about this movie before you show it to your kids. Again, I’m not blaming parents who didn’t get a good opinion, but really, man, be more careful. I’m not gonna do an “I hope this review helped!” Thing I normally do, because I am writing this review at 10:30 at night and I am very tired. So, goodnight, commonsense! See ya tomorrow!"
1915,7,"-This was a really fun movie. Based on the ratings, I was a little worried but it was pretty good. The language wasn’t the best, but most mature children will be able to handle it. There is a gay couple, so make sure that your kids understand that. Overall, good movie!"
1916,7,-It has violence but not that that much I watched it with a friend and her younger brother it has some language but it's pretty appropriate if you don't like violence don't watch it
1917,7,"-This Movie is honestly a great one, I loved seeing a big guy like Drax, teaming up with a Little girl. They have shanking, stabbing, shooting, punching and other violence but if your 10-11+ that won't bother you too much. There is too much swearing for a movie supposedly for 10 year olds. There is uses of Bit*h, Sh*t, Jesus and more but if you watch Action movies it won't be such a big deal, If your 10+ in my opinion it would be fine."
1918,7,"-A lot of bad language and a lot of bad fist fights that might scare your younger kids. Also some kissy stuff and flirting and gross stuff like that. Overall there are some good messages like team work and family. There are some scary weapons plus a main character throws a knife at another character and barfs, on accident. Although the action might be scary it is actually super sick. Very funny! Great movie!"
1919,8,-Not bad but pretty predictable and kinda corny at times. Aaron Paul's performance is great but overall it's not the best action film out there.
1920,8,-Aaron Paul is brilliant in this (it was good seeing him not cooking meth with a 50 year old man lmao) the movie is a fun pretty good movie! I like how there is no CGI used which is great! And what CSM forgot to put under positive messages is (SPOILERS) the bad guy manslaughters his friend and leaves him there and at the end a similar situation happens at the end with the bad guy in the car and Toby (Aaron Paul) takes him out of the car to make sure he’s alright.
1921,8,"-Need for Speed (the movie) has to be one of the better game-based movies out there. It has charming characters, intense but mostly grounded action, and some pretty great moments."
1922,8,-This movie is fine for younger teens.
1923,8,-It was a really good movie. Very good story the racing was amazing.
1924,8,-Good car movie
1925,8,-I think this movie is recommended for a 12+ but the nudity is not bad just a butt shown only
1926,8,"-My rating:PG-13 for intense sequences of crashes and action,some language,racy content,and brief nudity."
1927,8,"-This movie was fantastic! I loved the plot, it was invigorating and engaging. Movie does include a scene that takes place in a sex-ed classroom, diagrams are present as well as the classic banana-condom learning activity. I recommend this movie to kids 13 and older due to that one scene, as well as a few sexual comments throughout the movie. Any kids younger should either watch with a parent or not watch at all, but the movie has got great lessons and can teach kids some good values. There is also some mild drug taking (pot brownie) but it’s nothing serious, shouldn’t be a problem. Also, do be aware that there is some flirtation between a teacher and an undercover student (the student is actually 25, but pretending to be 17). I’d make sure your child is aware that student-teacher relationships are definitely not okay, because while this is a great movie, it’s from the 90’s, so it’s a bit more lack on that kind of thing than we are today. Overall, I’d definitely recommend it, just know your child and be ready to explain what’s okay and what’s not."
1928,8,"-Overall, this movie didn't wow me. I definitely didn't hate it, but it didn't really pack the punch i was hoping for. One of the most problematic themes is the flirting between the teacher and a perceived student. Although the ""student"" is actually an adult, my mom and I were still very concerned by this."
1929,8,-This movie was very entertaining but it has a lot of sex references. Definitely 13+ or 12 with a parent.
1930,8,-It a good movie! but  there is some drinking  and s-x in the movie. I think kids who are under 13 years old should watch it with a parent.
1931,8,-This movie has a great lesson and theme and is very good. The only thing some parents might have to worry about is a few uses of drugs and two people making out.
1932,8,"-The main character goes undercover as a high school student and she and a teacher clearly both are attracted to each other, even though he believes she's a student. When she announces that she is actually an adult, the teacher seems really conflicted and upset. But he was fine with it when he thought she was a minor? Gross."
1933,8,"-I have to say this is one of my all time favorite rom coms. Some scenes could be a lil iffy for younger viewers, like when they put condoms on bananas etc. Language is mild...couple of sh*ts once in a while. Also Micheal Varton is effing hot.:)"
1934,8,"-this movie was both funny-boring-inappropriate and just your normal rom-com.... I liked it and agree that it is a must see but... i dunno.... if you are looking for a really great rom-com watch, ""Love actually"" soooooo much better!! It wasn't as inappropriate as I thought it would be, unlike four weddings and a funeral but it is still a bit racy...I'd say watch it before you let your kids see it then decide what you think!"
1935,8,"-My rating:R for mature racy content throughout,graphic nudity,drug use,and language."
1936,4,-i lik it it fun and it help me lik buks more
1937,4,-I never played it before but could they at least try out a more original name?
1938,4,-Babyish... Why is this on best Wii Games? Besides Moose and Zee annoy me to death.
1939,7,-Nobody:
1940,7,"-It’s a funny film with a few stereotypes about  Sacajawea and Attila the Hun, also some mild peril and Larry is chased by Attila the Hun with swords, two little guys crash a car into a rock and they presumably died. Also some language like kick ass, hell and dum dum."
1941,7,-Pros: Yay! I'm glad I watched this movie! Now I know more about history! the only 2 things I don't like are:
1942,7,"-This is a really good movie. It has an awesome plot, and was surprisingly based off of a children's picture book that had less then twenty pages."
1943,7,-This movie has lots of adventure And a lot of comedy! It  might be a little scary for little kids though!
1944,7,"-This movie was great! It was action-packed and funny, and taught you a few facts throughout history in a fun way. Definitely a must-watch."
1945,7,"-Seriously CSM?? Three stars? This movie is so underrated. My entire family loves it. It has great characters, a great plot, and that twist at the end is amazing. *SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*"
1946,7,"-Mild, infrequent swearing. A few subtextual references that would go over most kids' heads. Some scenes, including a scene where a wax figurine is run over and another where a mummy is unwrapped, may be frightening to younger viewers."
1947,7,"-this movie seems a bit scary at first for little ones, but it all comes together as a really fun and hilarious movie.  It is fun for all ages 7 and up!"
1948,7,"-Night at the Museum is not the best film but fun and good for kids. Warning, the Civil war guys have masks on and may be a little creepy. This film is great but not for under seven. The old men disguise as goodies so can be quite scary."
1949,8,"-I grew up watching this movie. I have lived in a very diverse area all of my life, and this movie was always something  I could relate to.  As a child I would get done with dinner and beg on my hands and knees to watch this movie.  It got to the point that the movie just had to stay in the DVD player. I have seen a lot of bad reviews about this movie. I am wracking my brain as to why. It could be the ""scary"" themes represented but I cannot understand why it is such a big deal. A lot of movies have ""scary"" themes throughout. I also grew up loving Pocahontas and that is a terribly rated movie. If we allowed are children to watch movies with REAL LIFE SCENARIOS maybe our kids wouldn't be asshole or serial killers. Thank you very much."
1950,8,"-Oliver and company was phenomenal.... one of my favorite Disney movies of all time (tied with the great mouse detective) there are some kinda extreme scenes for little kids , one where desoto (one of the evil Rottweilers)gets hurt another where dodger (main character puppy) gets beaten up in a dog fight... and the adult human is told he’s going to die if he doesn’t pay his debts"
1951,8,-Love the music! Oliver and Rita and dodger are my favorites Jenny is great to so is Winston and gorgette is kinda annoying bill sykes AWESOME
1952,8,"-I have LOVED this movie since I was pretty little. The plot is a little bit unoriginal, and there are some bad role models (Georgette is a conniving, jealous diva. Fagan kidnaps a girl's cherished pet kitten to pay off a debt. Dodger is kind of rude and uncaring at times, but changes later. The villain, in addition to being a total jerk, smokes constantly) But just so long as kids know not to mimic that behavior, they'll be good. I think the main reason I love this movie so much is the music (especially ""Why Should I Worry"" and ""Perfect isn't easy"")."
1953,8,"-This movie has emotional elements including a kitten who is alone in the earlier scenes and some scary sequences including two meanacing dogs and an intense/violent death of a certain character. There is even some mild consumerism including an image of the Coca-Cola logo, some insults, suggestive content, messages and brief smoking. So it's on for ages 9+, iffy for ages 8- and off for ages 5-"
1954,8,"-Oliver and Company is an amazing movie! It's so underrated, everyone forgets about it but it's really good. It's funny and it has good songs (obviously, because Billy Joel is in it) it paved the way for the Disney Renaissance - which in my opinion are better than the 'classics' Oliver and Company is not to be pushed aside."
1955,8,"-I've loved Disney films since I was born. No, really. I was born in '93, and the first film I saw in a theater was The Lion King. I think of all the films I saw in the theater during the first few years of my life, The Lion King and Oliver and Company hold the most special place in my heart. I've seen TLK and other Disney classics many times over, but I've only recently rediscovered Oliver. The status of the film is a bit like its central character - this was originally a very popular film back when it was released in 1988, and even got a rerelease in 1996 (where I was first exposed to its greatness), but it took 7 years for it to get on home video, had mostly mixed-to-negative reviews, and went from popular to criminally overlooked. In the 80s, the dark period of Disney history, Oliver and Company was the light at the end of the tunnel, and it helped pave the way for the best films to come out of Disney since the ""Golden Age"" period that began with Snow White (1937) and ended with The Rescuers (1977). The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, and other films of the Disney Renaissance period (the 90s) were all created by the artists who started with Oliver and Company. But it doesn't give off the impression of being an experimental film; it ends up being a true classic. Oliver is an orphaned kitten living on the streets of New York City. He fights to survive until he meets Dodger, a dog (voiced by the always-cool Billy Joel) who is initially resistant to Oliver, but ends up liking him quite a bit. So much, in fact, that he introduces the kitten to his group of ragtag stray dogs, including the dumb Einstein, the smart Brit Francis, the sassy Rita, and the hilarious Tito. All of them help out a homeless man named Fagin, who owns a large debt to a loan shark named Sykes, one of the scariest villains in Disney's history. He owns two intimidating Dobermans, and they're both hostile towards Fagin's gang. Then, when Oliver learns how to survive, he's adopted by a little rich girl named Jenny, whose poodle Georgette is anything but pleased about. It all ends up becoming a tale of friendship and loyalty that's on par with anything Disney did during the Disney Renaissance. But the tone of this one is very gritty and realistic at points - a shock for Disney, but still counterbalanced with happy songs and what not. For example, the opening few minutes will make even the most hard-hearted cry at least a little, when Oliver is simply left alone in a dark and scary New York at night. But, the song playing during this scene, Huey Lewis' ""Once Upon a Time in New York City"", is sad yet uplifting, pointing towards better things that are yet to come. And that they do. The only other things to worry about are some mildly scary scenes (when Jenny gets kidnapped by Sykes, when the characters are threatened by Sykes' Dobermans, and the intense chase scene in the New York subway). Overall, though, CSM is wrong; they've got the same biased opinion on this as the film critics who haven't appreciated it for what it is: one of Disney's best classics. The music is awesome, the animation is awesome, the humor is awesome, the voice acting is awesome...so yeah. In only a little bit over an hour, Disney accomplishes more than most films of three hours can! Just see this one! You won't regret it."
1956,8,"-If you don't know, when you see Bill Sykes' evil smirk with  sitting on the chair and holding his cigar, that expression that looks like Shan Yu says “how many men does it to deliver a message?” That is all I can say! However, Oliver And The War is the best crossover movie ever created. But I recommended for ages 18 and up because of lot of violence and Elmo is very thicc."
1957,8,"-I like this movie. It's old, cute, got catchy music, and has an interesting storyline. Alright, so the interactions between two dogs was fine to a point, then one wanted to talk to the other alone and he it took as... something else. The two dobbermans can seem intimidating. In conclusion, a fun movie but children may need to be accompanied if they are sensitive."
1958,8,"-The movie is awesome, and I loved the songs ""streets of gold"""
1959,8,-With only some mild teen kissing and flirting to worry about kids are perfectly fine to watch One Crazy Cruise. Expect a silly story along with messages about embracing change and coming together as a family.
1960,8,"-This Movie is amazing.Cody Simpson in this movie dating Ellie.that  was how I thought it would end with a romantic ending.Liar,Liar, Vampire was really bad,so after I watched it I binge watched One Crazy Cruise I saw Good Ratings on it on Imdb.I wish it was on DVD So I could watch as many times I want. Nick Good Job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1961,8,-It is a very nice movie one of my favorites.
1962,8,-My rating:PG for rude humor throughout.
1963,6,"-This movie is about magic and how there's always a little magic inside you. I saw the movie on the TV and it was great. It's about 2 boys going on an adventure to try to bring their dad back in 24 hours. They'll introduce more characters and events. There are hard obstacles they have to overcome, great backup and heartful messages, and not too much violence. There is some, but not much. Overall, this movie is great. Disney/Pixar collaborations are great!"
1964,6,-A really sweet story with just the right amount of adventure.
1965,6,"-it was well done, funny and had no language or sex. mild action. a iffy comment about a female officer's girlfriend. an awesome family-friendly flick."
1966,6,"-Onward is the best movie of 2020 so far. Though the story is a bit lackluster (generic rescue story), they managed to make it work somehow. I almost cried 3 times, which 1 time it succeeded. One time was when Ian was listening to his dad using the cassette boombox, the time where I actually did cry was when Ian was sitting with dad's half-body realizing that Barley was just like a father figure to him, and the last time when Barley hugged Ian at the end."
1967,6,-It’s a good movie and I recommend it
1968,6,"-A lighthearted fantasy story with wonderful characters and powerful messages about family and selflessness. There is some combat, but it's not gory at all. I would recommend this to everyone."
1969,6,"-I enjoyed Onward, like I enjoyed many other Pixar films. Onward follows two boys who go on a journey to bring back their dad for a day. The stakes are high and the movie is interesting."
1970,6,-It's a must-watch amazing movie that really surprised me. It's very heartwarming and I recommend it!
1971,8,-Nature-set animated comedy with scenes that spoof.
1972,8,-I’d recommend it. It’s not every day you see computer-generated characters trampling computer-generated grass as they walk through it.
1973,8,-Good but crude some positive messages
1974,8,"-Unlike Tarzan 2, This film is not appropiate for ages 2-6 at all, there is lots of profanity (like ""Get off my tree you F***ing squirrel, and there is the word ass in the film, but it's hard to see), Overall, This film is not appropiate for ages 2-6 at all due to all of the bad language"
1975,8,"-This movie is watchable. But it has it's bits of badness,but overall,this movie is worth watching."
1976,8,"-This movie has everything: the word C**P, fart jokes, peeing jokes, poop jokes, horrible voice acting, animation, story, characters, everything. Pretty much this movie sucked. The only interesting part was the psychotic huntsman who has a gun and likes to go PEW PEW and tries to kill our not-so-beloved heroes. For once, I was on the antaganist's side. This is an awful example to younger viewers. Oh, DEER. See what I did there? Because one of the main characters is a DEER? Or DOE you not know what I'm talking about? ;)"
1977,8,"-This movie is kinda funny and I think it is a good family movie to watch. The only part that you want to know is that Shaw uses a gun to try to hunt the animals. Other than that, I recommend you watch it."
1978,8,-Personally I think it has a good story line and that little kids will laugh at the content. the only bit I may find a bit worrying is that they are being hunted and that when I was little it made me a bit afraid. It it OK though in my opinion as it ticked a lot of boxes but is was sad as the bear was separated from his mother and got PUT TO SLEEP. Be careful with your child as you would do with another p.g
1979,8,"-It was sooo boring! Also, one use of the C word. I'm glad other users caught that. Here's the scene. Boog is sitting on some sort of hay-like thing, and Elliot is trying to convince him to poop. Then he says, ""Come on, start c-r-a-p-p-i-n-'."". After that, I changed it to The Spongebob Movie. Watch that movie instead."
1980,8,"-This movie was educational enough, but there definitely was some iffy language.  Also is this just me or did they draw a six grader like an eighteen yr old. I dunno if its just the drawing style but Maria seems a tad bit sexualized."
1981,8,"-There was some violence, like old real-life videos of police assaulting protesters, bullying, and an off-screen shooting. A house is bombed as well and black kids are being called racial slurs. Along with drinking, drugs, and smoking, a dad smokes in the car. The language is brief, some mean words being called to people, and a dad in a car yelling mean things to other cars in front of him."
1982,8,-In some of them middle of the movie someones dad is smokeing.
1983,7,"-funny, family friendly"
1984,7,"-This movie was pretty good, But my 7 year old sister started freaking out at the crazy lady. She ran to the theater bathroom and stayed there for most of the duration of the movie. This was AWESOME. But the second movie was better."
1985,7,"-I really enjoyed this flim,but I think if you are under 8 you might get nightmares because there's a bit of violence in it which could scare little ones.But it's still a good flim!"
1986,7,"-Bear-tastic!  (sorry about the pun), it is amazing and heartfelt movie that has funny scenes.  It is a movie that all ages can laugh at.  Yes, there is an evil woman that is trying to turn Paddington into a stuffed bear, but there are so many other great scenes that are more memorable than that."
1987,7,"-Paddington is a fun family film at times, but at other times you feel like it doesn’t fit that description. I believe this is more of a scare than the sequel that came out recently. Millicent, the main antagonist, wants to stuff Paddington, since he is part of a rare species and she wants him for her collection. This theme is believed by me to only go well with kids eight or older. There was an iffy word, as well, that probably isn’t the best for a kids/family film. The word “sexy” is spoken in a scene where Mr. Brown dresses up as a lady. Paddington does bring a few good things, like how Mr. Brown eventually got on board with the idea of having Paddington, and the rest of the Brown family consider Paddington true family."
1988,7,-This movie is really well done!!!
1989,7,-PADDINGTON is a really positive movie about a family that find a bear and look after it. There may be scenes that are scary for young children but it is a very good movie.
1990,7,-The movie kind of freaked me out and made me want to run screaming from the movie theatre
1991,7,"-Why is it for six year olds? I watched it with my little brother, who is three, and he seemed to like it. The best part is when Paddington did all those weird things in the bathroom."
1992,7,"-In this movie, there is nothing to worry about!  I just love the good messages that the all the good role models!"
1993,7,-The only parts i think were bad was when the women was flirting with the neighbor.
1994,7,"-Paddington is a great movie. The only thing I may worn is that, even though Milicent(not telling who she is) is not meant to be scary, she may seem to be a little intence for kids younger then 8. Of course, it's a meant for family movie. There is nothing inapprocriate at all. This is from a kids point of view, so adults may have a different opinion. Great movie, overall, though!"
1995,7,"-I loved it. Ben Whishaw and the rest of the cast were excellent, especially Whishaw as the voice of Paddington. One of the best family films I have ever seen."
1996,7,-I think  that kids under 10 should NOT pay to watch this movie.There is an evil animal and people murderer who is after Paddington mostly the whole movie. But it is still pretty sweet (NO WAY!!!!) so all I am trying to say is it is too violent and stressful for kids under ten.
1997,7,-I think it is great  but there is mild violence so I rated it eight and up
1998,7,"-Great Movie ,4+, Paddington, rated PG, 5 OF 5 STARS ,ON Review, SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Good!!!!!!!!"
1999,7,"-Great movie, funny, and family friendly. A few funny references to the mission impossible series which young kids may not get,  fine for children, but Paddington himself is put in a lot of peril being shot at, getting stuck in an incinerator, and being put in a taxidermy van. The family itself has gret messages and paddington is a funny charecter their is a scene where Ms byrd is in a drinking contest and appears drunk even though they are never shown drinking alcohol. I also think your kids might be tempted to buy paddington books and stuffed animals"
2000,7,"-I think it was really good because it had lots of good messages,humor and great role models. Kids between the ages of 10 - 12 may not like it as much although."
2001,7,"-This movie was great! What an awesome story, everyone should watch this. There is some stuff sensitive parents may feel is not appropriate for younger children, like the fact that the main antagonist is trying to stuff paddington. But nothing violent is shown, so its fine for ages 6 and up and iffy for ages 5 and under."
2002,7,"-Funny, funny, funny!  Can't escape from funnyland!  When Paddington went on his bathtub boat was my favorite part."
2003,7,-Can be a bit sad but it is good
2004,7,-Paper planes is a really good film but it's sad at times. Kimi and Dylan pretty nice.
2005,7,-Pretty cool.
2006,7,-paper planes is the best movie ever!!
2007,7,"-The movie is ok, but a bit with acupuncture might be scary for young kids. There isn't any blood."
2008,7,-PAPER PLANES is nearly overflowed with positive messages. I think it is a great film for families.
2009,7,-Im using this film for a film study at school so I watched the movie for the first time (not some thing I usually watch) but surprisingly overall I loved this movie now one of my favourite movies it show cases that bullys can turn into friends and your family can be once again your rock if you give them time to heal from their scares.
2010,7,-Its amazing but it is  sad in some parts. Its inspired  me to make my own paper planes and to give things a go.
2011,8,-The movie is fantastic! It portrayed Pearl Harbor and what people may have thought during the attack perfectly. I recommend! But watch out when watching with younger kids! There is language and lots of violence but still a fantastic movie!!!
2012,8,-War in Hawaii that Japanese were attacking
2013,8,-Good war movie
2014,8,-This movie is recommended for a 12+
2015,8,-It's a Michael bay movie so it's really bad.
2016,8,-I have no idea why people say this movie is bad like on imdb they gave it a 6.1 which is a d- I mean come on yes the story is fake but well acted and interesting some language I believe ther is at least one f word and possibly 2 but very good movie
2017,8,"-25% on Rotten Tomatoes is still too good of a review for this movie. I wasn't even paying attention to it, writing on my computer while it was playing in the same room, and I was so distressed by the  utter cheesiness of it that I had to leave the room. "
2018,8,"-My rating:R for strong brutal war violence throughout, language throughout, and brief sexuality."
2019,8,-This is a great musical movie. I know people as young as 7 watch this but I think waiting till 13 is a better idea.
2020,8,"-Pitch Perfect is a great movie that cuts right to the heart, but it also has a lot of swearing, consumerism, and a bit of sex. Very good messages about never giving up , but kids under 11  might want to think twice about it."
2021,8,-Enough said.
2022,8,-This movie has to be my favorite movie of all time!  I have seen it over 10 times and it never gets old.  The singing and acting is amazing and the movie is over all hilarious!
2023,8,-I loved this movie so much! I watched it in the plane and I needed up laughing out loud at so many parts. I feel like the other passengers on the plane thought I was a little weird. The music and dancing is also really amazing. It makes me just want to get up and start grooving. ;) I defiantly recommend this movie for teens.
2024,8,-I am 13 and I loved this movie you have to be kinda mature to  see it there is some language issues but it didn't bother me any.  There is at least 2 or 3 scenes were she throws up. But again that didn't bother me. I absolutely loved it and think other kids my age would to!
2025,8,"-This movie is halarious and great for a mature 11 year old. Some inappropriate things were said like bi*ch and s*it. In the beginning a girl introduce herself to Becca the main character and tells her where her room and gives her a whistle and says ""This is your official Bardon university rapist whistle. Do blow it unless it's really happening"". Also there were a bunch of college kids at a party drinking and one girl says that she needs her ""jiggle juice"". One girl admits to having lots of s*x. One point in an a cepella ""riff off""(a battle between a Capella groups) they have categories and one of them was songs about s*x and then they started singing about it. That was a little awkward when watching it. Overall,this movie was entertaining and fun to watch other than the bad stuff. I loved it and I'm still waiting to see the second one."
2026,8,"-This movie fallows Beca a girl in collage who is a DJ. At the school there a five acapella groups and one of then is the Barden Bella's, the best acapella group there is the troubles. Then beca gets invited to join the Bella's after they lost a conniption because on of the Bella's threw up on everyone. So then Beca decided's to join and try to them good again. This movie is extremely vulgar and racy, there is tons of gay, and lesbian jokes, implied racy content, a scene in a show with breasts visible, extremely crass and explicit references about racy content, some kissing, and some inappropriate gestures. There is also tons of constant vulgar language including 30+ uses of s--t f--k sl-tbags d--k p---y p---s  etc. There is lots of underage drinking, partying, and drug use throughout. There is no violence at all, but its suspenseful if ether going to win or not. This movie is fantastic, amazing, hilarious, fun and enjoyable but to racy for teens. My rating;R for strong racy content/nudity throughout, pervasive language, graphic nudity, strong alcohol and drug use, and vulgar references."
2027,8,"-Great comedy has only one bad scene, when a man says the F-Word about 30 times in a row. The rest is either a light PG-13 or a strong PG."
2028,8,"-Good but smoking, and language."
2029,8,"-Although this movie  has an iconic tirade with f--k repeatedly, just about everything else is PG-appropriate. It is a great thanksgiving movie for somewhat older kids, and a very funny movie anytime!"
2030,8,-Funny comedy just has a brief scene of strong language okay for kids 11 and up.
2031,8,-One of the best comedies
2032,8,"-Planes , trains and automobiles is a funny yet sad comedy about two strangers whos flight is delayed and they share a room together and go on an adventure. Ther is a scene with a lot of uses of the f word, and more language   through the whole movie. It is not sexual, or crude. Must watch"
2033,8,"-Sure there's some bad language but it's not horrible and it's very funny and great for kids 10+, if you are younger than 10 I recommend you have a parent approval. Enjoy the movie"
2034,8,"-As far as I can say, this is a very good movie, although I did see some adult*ish* jokes I think this is perfectly suitable for kids 13+."
2035,8,-Honestly this movie is fine for 13 year olds if you skip the scene in which Steve Martin uses the dreaded F-bomb. this actually would have been a pg movie if they would have removed this scene. The only major issue here is the language.
2036,8,-I like how two friends stay together to get to the guys house. It shows how you should stay together no matter what. That's just what you do.
2037,7,-This movie is good but has a one minute sequence of flashing lights in the beginning and a really long sequence of flashing lights (15-20 minutes) near the end. So this movie contains a lot of sequences of flashing lights that may affect viewers with epilepsy or any other photosensitivity.
2038,7,-I think this movie is great for youngsters who like scary/gory stuff
2039,7,"-Poltergeist has not aged well. It also isn’t that scary. The tree coming to life and the goofy clown doll don’t just scare like they should. Some scenes work well, though. The nightmarish scene when the man tears his face in the mirror is truly great stuff. Overall though, not particularly frightening."
2040,7,-If you can watch Harry Potter it is fine for you.
2041,7,"-Aside from the face peeling scene - in which the effects are quite outdated - this movie has no blood and gore and leaves the scares to the supernatural happenings throughout the film. It is definitely not, however, for any kids under 10/11 as it brings the kids' beloved toy into the evil action with the - already creepy - toy clown. It is scary but the parents set great examples because they are very committed to saving their family. A few swear words are included but overall there isn't too much profanity."
2042,7,"-This is the cheesiest trippiest ghost film ever.  I know it was original when it came out but now everything in it is cliché and poorly executed compared to it's followers. A small amount of violence, and the parents do drugs but nothing much else inappropriate. Don't watch this film for entertainment. I guess it's worth watching if you want to see the inspiration behind better ghost films such as insidious and the conjuring. 2/5 stars."
2043,7,"-Poltergeist is a family horror movie that is fairly scary. The violence isn’t too bad, but in one particularly gross scene, a man rips his face off and reveals his bloody skull. The scene is in the man’s head which could make it a little less frightening. The family is fearless and strong in the face of danger, and will stop at nothing to bring back their daughter from the Other Side. They can teach kids to always work for what you want and don’t give up. The swearing is fairly moderate, with a few cases of b—tch, s—t, damn, and hell. Overall, this movie should be suitable for a 10 yo child."
2044,7,-Steven Spielberg classic.  Good but scary.
2045,6,"-I just watched this movie with my little sister today. We both loved it, and I'm 14! It was really cute, and I love Miyazaki's movies. Studio Ghibli's artwork and animation is beautiful and amazing. Even if you think you're too old for it, go see it anyway, you won't be disappointed."
2046,6,"-This Movie is My Fav Movie Ever!!! It Made Me Love Anime Now I Watch Fruits Basket, Toradora and Other Animes all Because of This Movie and I Watched When I Was 6 and Became an Instant Miyazaki Fan. I Really Love This Movie"
2047,6,"-A great movie! Mostly for younger kids but your older ids can still watch it, and I don't now how they couldn't love it."
2048,6,"-I am a huge fan of Studio Ghibli's films. The animation is fantastic and the plot is very cute. I don't know why people are having a cow over the breastfeeding line though, because THATS WHAT THEY'RE FOR!  It's better for kids to learn here instead of school, right? Anyways, yeah I love all of Mizayaki's works and this is definatley a good movie."
2049,6,"-Firstly, let me get one thing clear: this wasn't a bad film. I actually think it's a good opportunity for family members to come together and watch a friendly film with the kids. It's cute and strange, definitely  visually breathtaking. These are all very good things that keep kids enlightened and entertained! But for the most part, Ponyo is simply a story about a little fish girl who falls in love with a human boy, and they spend the entire movie acting cute while the world ends. There are two points I need to address here, one being: the storyline is just fine for kids, but for adults, it could get boring. I mean, all it really is is this adorable, five-year-old love story which, to be honest with you, isn't overwhelming. But what about the world ending, you ask, isn't that overwhelming? That is what I am going to address in my second point. The whole issue with the world ending, I think that was just Hayao Miyazaki's attempt to throw some massive adventure in there, and to tell you the truth, I think he COULD have done better. The end of the world, as we all now, is a major deal. However, the people in the movie treat it as a minor inconvenience, as if they hadn't just lost all their homes and possessions. Also, nobody even questions why all this is happening, or why there are frightening, ancient fish underwater. They simply go along with it, which I gotta say is the very thing that makes this movie underwhelming. It's underwhelming people put in and overwhelming situation, and when that happens, you KNOW the situation is going to be a whole lot more bland than before. So, in itself Ponyo is a memorable film, mostly for its quirkiness and nonstop adorableness. Seriously, the cutsey moments in this movie are too much to bare. This, paired with the fantastic animation, is why most people tend to see Ponyo as a masterpiece. With all this in mind, Pony now seems a bit overrated to me. I mean, sure, it's a pretty good movie except for the story, and it did it's job well as a kid's film. But there's allot of waiting, and once I saw Ponyo the second time, I fell asleep halfway through. Some things parents need to know: This movie is perfect for kids. It's not scary or spooky, it's just different and strange, but sometimes people mix up the two. Ponyo is a good film for all ages, Most of the time."
2050,6,"-I love this movie to death! I remember going to theaters watching this with my mom in the summer time. This is a great movie for little kids but they might get a funny feeling watching the kind of animation. I suggest this for 9yrs and up, but you can let your children watch it. When I was 5, I liked anime a little bit. But now, I'm a lover of anime! Watch this with your kids, it's a must see! In the summer time, when it is raining outside, I go watch some anime movies or some shows and if my big brother isn't busy,he watches anime too. Me and my brother are freaks of anime movies and shows. Try and do that with your family."
2051,6,-great movie
2052,8,-I would say that the creepiest things in the movie were the demons. both were covered in worms/snakes. there is lots of violence even though the main character kind of uses violence as a last resort. 2 people's heads are shot off of their body's using arrows. and there is lots of blood. there is some profanity.I completely loved the movie.
2053,8,"-Beauty meets violence in this gorgeously crafted anime movie. Ashitaka is a young prince in a far-off village, protecting his people with his life along with his trusty elk, Yakul. When he is inflicted with a terrible demon's curse, he sets out on an epic adventure to find his true self, lift the curse, and save the forest. But into his midst comes a mysterious princess known as Princess Mononoke. This is probably one of Hayao Miyazaki's greatest -- and more violent -- movies. The animation is absolutely breathtaking; Miyazaki can craft anything from an agile red elk to a sparkling, tranquil forest to a demon-god larger than an elephant. But watch out for graphic violence. (SPOILER ALERTS) At the beginning of the movie, Ashitaka and his friend are attacked by a horrible demon that appears to be a boar covered in swirling worms. When Ashitaka kills it, the flesh disappears from its body, and the bloody skeleton is left behind. However, Ashitaka is left with a steaming wound that the elders say is destined to kill him. Kids might be upset when Ashitaka has to leave the only home he's ever known to lift the curse upon him. At another village, Ashitaka witnesses a bloody massacre, in which his wounded arm swells and seems to has a mind of its own; it causes him to accidentally cut off someone’s arms and another person’s entire head. In a heavy rainstorm, Lady Eboshi and her men fight a wolf; one person shoots the wolf and sets it on fire briefly, and it falls off a cliff. Later, we see Princess Mononoke (usually called San) come into the story for the first time; she finds the old wolf on the banks of a river, and she sucks and spits out the blood from the wolf’s bullet wound (her mouth becomes covered in blood). After Ashitaka arrives in Irontown, the central village of the story, San attacks the citizens of Irontown, along with her two wolfs (there is a sword fight between San, Ashitaka, and Lady Eboshi). When Ashitaka knocks Lady Eboshi unconscious, he is shot through the stomach, but continues to advance through the village without any apparent struggle. An ancient boar called Okkoto becomes covered in the same swirling worms as the boar at the beginning of the movie, and San becomes trapped within the worms on his face; Okkoto appears to become a demon, and San almost becomes one, too. One of the main conflicts of the story is based on the keeping of the peace between the humans and the forest. However, not all want it to be that way. Lady Eboshi strives to kill the Forest Spirit and give the head of the creature to a man named Jigo, who says he will help her people in return. She succeeds in cutting off the head of the spirit of the forest; the rest of the spirit’s body turns into a creature made of dark, lifelike ooze that kills a living thing instantly upon contact. Lady Eboshi’s arm is then bitten off by a wolf. These are just a portion of the many violent scenes of this movie, all of which are fairly bloody and gory, but are still amazing and entrancing to watch. Language includes “damn,” “piss,” and “bastard,” but there is really no sex. For those who are afraid of blood or watching people’s limbs get ripped from their bodies, this will be too scary and/or violent. But for those who are huge Miyazaki fans and are okay with the violence, bloody and all, it will be an action-packed joyride that they won’t soon forget."
2054,8,"-OK, first off, this movie is violent. People are killed and people's limbs fall off. The PG-13 rating is right."
2055,8,"-What you need to know is I hate gory movies, although this movie did have some gore, All the violence in the beginning is pretty quick and at some parts comical. near the end it gets pretty gory but is still manageable. There are a lot of people on hear saying they showed it to their six year old, Its rated pg-13 so you don't show it to youngsters, I mean really c'mon people the front has a picture of a girl with blood on her face and guy with a sword and scar. If you cannot handle gore whatsoever don't watch this. If you can handle some and not get scared watch it right now, it is so good."
2056,8,"-It is violent, but not too violent. when i first watched it i was 8, and i loved it!"
2057,8,"-An absolutely amazing movie with intense action, fair amounts of blood, an amazing soundtrack, and an amazing story that you won't forget anytime soon. This movie is amazing and a great choice for families that enjoy Japanese movies and anime."
2058,8,"-The animation and story is very unique and focuses on the story of a teenage boy trying to lift a curse caused by a hateful demon. It discusses how violence and hatred brings trouble to people, and how humans are destroying the environment with their greed. A more mature and significantly better animated Fern Gully. I would NOT recommend this to anyone who doesn't like blood or body gore, there is only 2-3 scenes with this but I found it uncomfortable to watch. I also noticed a few cuss words (ass a few times, damn 3-4 times, and bastard once)."
2059,8,"-This is the sequel to the 1995s hit, The Flying Castle but this 1 adds more gory violence and graphic killing with lots of gore;. This drama has tons of bloody/graphic/disturbing and shocking violence characters are sliced,stabbed,shot,blown to bits etc. There are also lots of gory images including a girl eating a wolf and spitting the blood from her mouth,blood is seen splattering,lots of pools blood and some very graphic wounds,(some disturbing and very gory content). There is no swearing or racy content but there is some drinking and flirting. This sequel is epic and very thrilling but due to strong bloody violence its and iffy choice for teens. My rating:R for bloody and graphic violence throughout,disturbing content/images,and intense sequences of gruesome and bloody images."
2060,7,"-The worst part about it is how much it swears, particularly the f word. Unlike most of Quentin Tarantino's other films, Pulp Fiction is not very violent. It has a bit of blood and a few shootings. This is definitely my favourite film by Tarantino, if not my favourite of all time. A must watch for mature people aged 13 and up."
2061,7,"-I'm 14 and this is my favourite movie of all time. The acting is great, the violence is brutal, and the screenplay is legendary. Everybody should see this movie!!!"
2062,7,"-Pulp Fiction is one of Tarantino's greatest films, making great use of the film and using it to tell a brilliant story. However, after all, this is a Tarantino film, with extreme violence, sex and language. Children shouldn't have access to this film anyway, and for teenagers it depends on their maturity. Pulp Fiction is a really good film aided by perfect storytelling, but contains, mainly, A LOT of violence."
2063,7,"-Many people consider Pulp Fiction to be Quentin Tarantino's greatest film, and that's hard to argue. Included are some of his best characters, dialogue, and music. The film follows three stories of two hit men reclaiming their boss's briefcase, one of them later taking the boss's wife to dinner, and a boxer in a fixed fight who goes on the run after winning the fight. One of the funniest movies of all time and one of the best written, Pulp Fiction is a knockout film recommended for mature teens with a dark sense of humor. "
2064,7,"-It's a Tarantino movie so you know what to expect, violence, drug use, gore, etc.  My friend recommended me this movie about a month ago, and I have to say I was skeptic at first, but when I saw this movie, goddamn! You have to watch this it's one of the best movies out there!"
2065,7,"-Watching this movie is really a kid-by-kid thing. I watched it at age 14, but if your child is uncomfortable watching violence and hearing swear words (or you are uncomfortable with it), maybe this movie isn't for them. There are some eye covering moments. It is a very clever film that everyone should watch in their lifetime."
2066,7,"-I watched this with my roommate, Toby, and we thought it was great.  Nothing is real.  I know a place where we can go together.  Do you hear me, Allison?  Could you ever.  I know you didn't like it here but this is too far.  They're telling me to pull the plug.  Can you hear–"
2067,7,"-This is without doubt Tarantino's best film, I have seen almost all of his movies, and this is the one that sticks out in my memory. Almost every line in the movie makes for a great quote. One of John Travolta's best films, and Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as always. There is however a good deal of violence. Lots of blood and gore, a couple very violent scenes are set in a very humorous tone. (Man accidentally shot in the face, sets off comedic dialogue.) There is a torture scene, a man is slashed by a katana, a man is shot in the private area, another person is shot in the leg, a guy gets run over by a car, etc... etc... As for langauge... Well this movie actually set the record for the most uses of the F-word in a single film. 271 to be exact, also quite a few racial slurs, as well as other various assorted cussing. Also, there is some sexual content, implied oral sex (appears off screen), a man is briefly shown being raped... etc... Yet another major factor would be the drug use, many characters ""shoot up"" with heroin, one girl overdoses, main characters use drugs like some would take aspirin."
2068,7,-This movie is violent but funny IF your teens want to watch it consider talking to them that this movie can be very funny but violent commonsensemedia says it's not for kids but when they're like 12-15 i guess you could start saying that they can watch it but if they are scared turn it off immediately so you could give them a restriction so until they're 18 they can watch it but you don't generally need to do it i'm just saying that that's good  because this movie generally makes it not for kids to get money and stuff like that only just because they want to make money for adult's dosen't mean that you cant give it for kids under 18 and because of that never mind the violence and sex so like give them a huge educational value so inorder to watch it
2069,7,-It's a swashbuckling adventure that features the irresistible warrior cat.
2070,7,"-It is hilarious but has some rude humor that adults will get but not little kids. It has some suitable lessons like trust and the bond between friends. My family enjoys it every time, but personally, I think it is best if whoever is watching it is at least 7 or 8."
2071,7,"-This show is very good, but I think the death character in this movie is too scary"
2072,7,"-I loved everything about the movie! most movies have a pros and cons list but I can't think of anything negative to say about this! The pacing was good, the villan atchually scared me, and the story was easy to understand! I didn't come out of the theater with questions as usual. I am putting 5 and up because they do reference curse words by bleeping the characters and cutting to another scene."
2073,7,"-Funny, sweethearted take on classic hero."
2074,7,-I have seen the 2011 Spin-Off and it is one of my favorite DreamWorks Spin-Offs next to Penguins Of Madagascar.Guys it’s Puss In Boots that’s the way he is you watched Shrek and it was inappropriate and Puss In Boots is a part of the Shrek Franchise.
2075,7,"-Contains cartoonish fantasy violence throughout, not many sexual content apart from Puss being coo over his flirtatious sidekick, little to no profanity. There is a gag about how catnip mimics marijuana and how it cures Puss' glaucoma."
2076,7,"-Well,a movie about Puss in Boots. It doesn't work 100%,with the wrting being somewhat weak and the new characters unmemorable-but at least Antonito reprises his role and the animation is good."
2077,7,-This movie should always have a five star rating.  It's awesome! Many people may like it.
2078,8,-I agree with everyone else. The 2001 version of this show is classic. This modern version is garbage.
2079,8,"-This show ruined my childhood. The original (which came out in 2001, NOT the 90s, as some parents have claimed) was waaaay better than this pile of garbage. The Raggs band started in 1990 which is probably why they think the original show started then. The show didn't exist till 2001. Anyways, the original show was much better. The dogs were cuter, the music was more fun, the dogs interacted with humans, their voices were much better than the poor voice acting done here, and most importantly, NO DUMPSTER!!!! I cannot believe they went and ruined a perfect show. Ugh, just watch the original series instead of this pile of trash."
2080,8,-This show is just a ripoff of 321 Contact. Watch the Doodlebops instead.
2081,8,-One episode had Razzles cry over a hat and its not even funny
2082,8,"-The music is great, but the costumes scared me as a kid."
2083,8,"-Ralph is a big baby in this. It shows the dark web and criminal activity. And, when Ralph and Vanellope were at eBay, Vanellope looked at sections, and said, ""Sports.... food... big baby clothes?? Something called lingerie..."" Should they be putting tHAT IN A KID'S MOVIE? And Ralph and Vanellope go to a ""root"" beer cavern and seem pretty strange after!!"
2084,8,-i love it !
2085,8,"-Slighty swearing, no nudity, slighty violence, but too much consumerism, there's fortnite,instagram, ebay, youtube, GTA, disney, DC, Marvel and more! Great role models!"
2086,8,-I think this movie is very creative and good for younger kids.  but it's kind of cheesy for older kids.
2087,8,-Disney has out done itself by going out to explore the internet world! This is an amazing sequel although I prefer it to be watched by kids 10 and above due to high violence (and the internet has some crazy stuff not for kids.) It also depicts the strength of friendship.
2088,8,-AWESOME NEED TO WATCH
2089,8,"-""Ralph Breaks The Internet"" has quite a bit of consumerism, and most people won't leave without knowing the name of one of the companies shown in the film.  While traveling into the ""Dark Web"" we do encounter many ""scary"" viruses and glitches though.   The movie is still okay for young audiences though."
2090,8,-The movie itself was pretty solid with it emphasizing about tech today and using terms and and tips to help kids today use the internet. The thing is that the plot is confusing. SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!
2091,8,"-Sequels are supposed to be more mature and darker but this film. It's more friendlier and better. I love how every single moment of this movie especially when they reach the internet because almost everything they saw in the internet was real except that Google was Mr.Knowsmore and Buzzztube was YouTube. I 100% recommend to everyone except preschooler because this movie has a lot of very mild swearing and the virus scene is very scary for younger or sensetive kids. Look, I watched this when I was 11, I was still scared when Ralph became a virus. So, don't worry"
2092,8,-really good
2093,7,"-I really liked this movie. My 13 year old brother, 8 year old sister, my mom and I all watched this movie together. My brother said it was okay, my sister kept on asking me what was going on (though she also really liked it) , however my mom and I were very happy with everything."
2094,7,"-I watched this movie with my little brothers, one 9 and the other...4. I wish they weren't there. Good thing they don't understand movies like this. Here:"
2095,7,-This is one of the most suckish movies i've ever seen! My sisters LOVED it but I was bored to death.
2096,7,"-dont watch it!!!bad movie,it swears,has sexual stuff,and consumerism,and drinking.horrible choice.awful"
2097,7,"-This movie is terrible, with it's foul language and it's blasphemous religious act towards something. Don't see it. Not even without your kids. It's a waste of time."
2098,7,"-I think that Rango is a  perfect movie for the younger kids. It also has a positive message! It is a powerful story. Also there is nothing that could possibly wrong with this movie. The names are creative, all the way to the characters."
2099,7,"-Great movie, a really good take on westerns. There was a good deal of language, stuff like d**n, hell, and even b**ch, which is not heard over the cry of a hawk. A lot of shooting and guns, which is typical of a western, and when Rango walks into the saloon, there is smoking, drinking, and card playing going on. Plenty of humor, though not all of it is for younger kids. Some kissing. Overall plenty of fun, but best for ages 8 and up."
2100,7,"-Ok, when the trailers first came on TV, I was like ""Oh! I want to see that movie!"" But my mom didn't, but she got me the DVD because it was about a LIZARD. It does not matter if the movie's about an animal! I watched it with my 16-year old cousin, and we were BOTH terrified! I was screaming, and I had to hold a stuffed animal. My cousin was vomiting. And, the Indian scene, I feel sorry for my Grandma, who is half Native American! Then, me and my cousin burned the DVD, And threw the DVD case onto the road. I explained to my parents, and now, They will never let me watch Rango again. Stay FAR away from this movie!"
2101,7,"-Many reviews say ""Not for kids!"" or ""+13"" I'm 14 and this movie was really bad! You might like it if you are into animation or like western style but I truely hated it. The only good thing about this movie was that Johnny Depp stared in it. 5 stars for Johnny Depp and a great big ""Boo"" to the film makers. Horrible job advertising this movie on childrens T.V stations and then flipping it around to be for adults. Teens hated it... Children cant watch it... So why exactly is an animation about a lizard who swears supposed to be for any teen, adult, or child? NOT recommended."
2102,7,-I loved this movie.  I think other  people should see it.
2103,6,-Cute rat tale has some peril and potentially scary moments.
2104,6,"-Some people might say that the characters in “Ratatouille” are unrealistic, but actually the characters include a lot of true and dramatic character traits like rudeness and jealousy. Not only are the traits in the characters is fabulous, but also the storyline is great. The story started out with the main character introducing himself to us, then as the rat family got exposed, they were forced to the drain which led them to Paris. In Paris, he succeeded in his dreams. I like how the story included the dish Occitan, Occitan is a French Provençal dish of stewed vegetables. About the theme (main lesson in a story), there was a man that kept jumping out to tell the rat not to give up or stop his dreams. For example, sometimes in life, risking your dreams or doing something unexpected can lead to a successful ending."
2105,6,-I  pirated this movie and still want a refund
2106,6,"-Remy, a provincial rat with a wonderful sense of smell, hates garbage and risks death to enter a human kitchen where he discovers real food and the cooking of five-star chef, Anton Gusteau, author of ""Anyone Can Cook"". On the day Remy learns his hero has died, he is evicted and ends up alone in Paris. By luck, he discovers Gasteau's restaurant, down to three stars and run by a frozen-food-hawking chef. As Remy enters, so does Linguini, a clumsy youth hired as a garbage boy. To save the soup that Linguini accidentally fouls, Remy throws in some ingredients; the soup is a success and Linguini's career as a chef is born. Can Remy find a way to maintain the fiction and use his gift?"
2107,6,-this is a work of art.
2108,6,-This movie changed my life
2109,6,-A classic that I think is great for anyone.
2110,6,"-I was watching this movie and it was fine until I heard someone say “Ratatooing” here and also one problem is that, there's no Mickey Mouse here. Education Value has none there is a some drinking and it says “Ratatooing” a lot. It catches Atai Omurzakov dancer man as WALL-E. And yeah I recommend for 22+"
2111,8,-i love this movie every time i watch i i pick up on something new that just adds to the story and makes it so much better and it´s so interesting.
2112,8,-so let me get this out first. I couldn't really focus on the movie so my review might have mistakes.
2113,8,"-It’s fine. Nothing I personally enjoyed. The animation and voice acting do make it bearable. It’s not the best of Disney’s animated movies, but it’s perfectly serviceable family entertainment. I didn’t have that much interest in it, but I’m sure others will!"
2114,8,"-Raya and the Last Dragon was another fun heroine movie from Disney! I liked it, but Raya looks just like Moana and the storyline is kind of like it too. Overall, it’s worth it to watch it though. I think kids 6-7 and up are totally ok to watch it."
2115,8,"-Good ol' movie. Has good action scenes and messages, but here's a quick tip for parents: Sometimes they imply swear words, like a** and b****."
2116,8,"-I don't want to pay $30 plus my existing Disney Plus subscription. Aquafina is awful, and so is her design. It looks like a 4 year old picked up crayons and drew her mom a blue dragon. I don’t understand how Disney went from Moana to Rays and the last dragon. It is unfunny, and cringe worthy. I don’t know why this film attempts to immerse you in the time period when you have Aquafina making a joke about being in a school project. Why was this in the movie? Maybe she is a time traveler like the genie. I normally don’t get this mad over Disney movies, but I am mad. I payed $30 dollars, and wished I got that money back. I don’t underestimate Disney’s talent because this movie is gorgeous, but that doesn’t fix the multiple problems. I’m sorry Disney but you need to get your act together. There is a positive message hidden behind the lackluster jokes, but it is covered in Disney’s blockbuster coat."
2117,8,"-Positive messages, a bit tense at moments"
2118,8,"-Raya and the Last Dragon is a great film. I really hoped this film could live up to my expectations, and for the most part, it did. It feels pretty good to have a good Disney film again, considering I hadn’t loved some of their newest films. I’m not sure if it’s worth $30 to watch it on Disney+, but the decision is up to you. "
2119,8,"-this movie is such a good family movie. People get turned into statues by an evil spirit thing, but thats as bad as it gets. it is very funny, there is some fighting, there is no swearing, and the main charicters are great role models."
2120,8,-Great
2121,8,-This movie is really romantic and great dancing.  Fred Astaire and Jane Powell are great dancers and really a cute brother and sister ( in the movie !)
2122,6,-Amazing
2123,6,-I think this was too scary for younger kids.  A good movie for tweens but nothing younger.
2124,7,"-It's appropriate, I liked how it included Rich Brian and 88 rising. "
2125,7,"-This was a great way to get back to theaters. This movie lived up to my expectations. The whole time my heart was racing, it could have been the butter on my popcorn, but that doesn’t matter. The fight choreography is stunning, the writing is fine as wine in the summertime. The costumes are to the nine and the visual effects are breathtaking. I highly recommend this movie."
2126,7,"-great fight scenes and amazing cgi, safe for most kids and even toddlers to watch"
2127,7,-very good movie with good messages and themes. super funny movie that the whole family should enjoy!!
2128,7,"-There is some language; a few uses of s—t, and one mouthing of f—k. Lots of martial arts violence. Cast is mainly Asian. Movie has great messages."
2129,7,"-Parents, in my opinion the only thing you really need to worry about is when someone  says the v word once. However, this is only based on your child’s maturity."
2130,7,"-I think kids should see this to know that there are all sorts of heroes, not only white americans. Great Chinese-American tale, amazing storyline and phenominal graphics. A joke about a lady's genitals, and BS, jacka**, sh*t hell damn and b*tch were repeated a lot throughout the movie, so watch out for that. Amazing messages, but a lot of violence and gore. A man was kicked in the testicles once. Otherwise, amazing."
2131,7,"-VIOLENCE: Shang's father built quite a reputation after his wife died by killing those responsible. But it didn't end there. He continued his brutal behavior for another 10 years before his ""wife"" started calling to him, asking him to safe her. [Spoilers: The voice was not his wife, but a mimic created by the ancient beast called the Dweller. Similar creatures end up attacking a village, sucking the souls from its occupants. To describe the process, the creatures grab the victim and absorb a glowing orb from their body (their soul). Other fighting sequences in the movie are mainly martial arts.] People are stabbed, punched, and kicked in all sorts of ways. Some assassins fall from tall scaffolding, and some fall off cliffs."
2132,7,"-I loved this movie! It got a little confusing at the end, but it was still amazing. It was also very funny.  If you are worried about inappropriate stuff the girl Katy references vagina 2 times.  ( when they are talking abt childbirth and abt changing names normal name Gina to slang gina) I love this movie though!!"
2133,7,"-SHANG CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS. The movie was EXCELLENT and for me i am a huge huge huge MARVEL fan, and for me it is on of the best some languege Like S*** and B*** and stuff like that violence is average for 10 and over either then that you should approve to watch the movie GREAT MOVIE."
2134,8,-I think Sharknado is an awesome movie but there is a lot of vilonse and suffering between character. There is also a few kissing sense. Also the language is very harsh. Other than that Sharknado is a great movie! There is also a great role model.
2135,8,"-This is a great B-Movie for ages 10 and up. The whole plot of the movie is laughing as people are killed by sharks that fall out of the sky, but its so bad that it's good. The only thing to worry about is violence and gore, which looks like a video game. (So if your kids can handle Call of Duty, they'll be fine.) This movie is great for a movie night!"
2136,8,"-This movie is so funny! It is literally the worst movie I have ever seen, which makes it that much better! You should watch it! Sharks start swarming in a hurricane, and rain down on people. Everything is fake and really hilarious. The main characters are comical and sometimes a little stupid. A lot gets destroyed, and a few people die. But it's obviously fake, so it will not scare most people. However, don't show it to your little kids."
2137,8,"-This movie interested me because I like shark stuff. There is plenty of violence in this movie. Sharks eating people or even just biting off their legs or their arms. There is a tornado with sharks inside and they have to find a way to survive. A girl is inside a shark and it shows you a man cutting the shark and taking her out of it. There is no sex besides kissing and the language is not strong. People say shit and hell and that is all. There is some drinking in this movie but you should not be worried about that. Nothing happens after they drink, they do not get drunk or anything like that. I think that this movie is okay for kids ages 14 and up because most of the deaths are gruesome. WATCH IT IF YOU ARE 14 AND OLDER THOUGH BECAUSE IT IS AN AMAZING MOVIE."
2138,8,-This movie is amazing. There is a lot of blood and I mean a lot. But the blood looks fake . Their is some bad language but I think that a twelve year old kid should be allowed to watch it. The effects are not well done at all. If they were that would be a different story
2139,8,"-I hate this movie sooooooooooooooooooooooooo much I love it.  Amazing. So funny. With the scene with the school bus, look at the name on the side of the bus."
2140,8,"-My rating:NC-17 for extreme gore,extreme blood,extreme violence,and some sexual content."
2141,8,-good movie one of dc's best!
2142,8,-watch with friends and family!
2143,8,"-Shazam! is great! I’ve seen the movie so many times and each time I love it just the same. Newcomers and fans of the DCEU will have loads to appreciate, and the movie is certainly more entertaining for families. However, the film is a bit more dark and scary than parents may have anticipated."
2144,8,-this movie is pretty darn tame compared to something like suicide squad. yet kids still watched that! people are overreacting its a good movie
2145,8,"-Shazam is a DC film about a boy named Billy who keeps on running away from foster care, in search of his birth mom. Billy is then put into another home, where he meets his half-brother/best friend, Freddy. He later meets a wizard who grants him powers by just saying one word: Shazam! Parents might want to be aware that there is moderate violence in this film, including a very distressing scene where a boy can’t find his mum and gets lost in the crowd. Luckily, police help him. A man’s eye contains the seven sins, which could easily disturb younger children. A seventh sin bites a man’s head off and throws him out a window. No blood. The villain could scare some viewers. A monster attacks a guy in a wheelchair as the doors close. Shazam is thrown onto a car, and he has blood on his nose. In addition to violence, look out for some moderate coarse language, including: s- -t, middle finger gestures, d- -k, a man swears on TV but it is bleeped out and easy to tell he was saying f- -k. No sex in this movie, but Billy drinks some beer and quickly spits it out. This should be fine for kids 10+."
2146,8,-This is by far the best DCEU film to come out since Wonder Woman. Although not as dark as Wonder Woman this movie does has it darker moments. Some scenes that has violence in it may seem too shocking since some of it comes out of nowhere. But it keeps a wonderful light hearted tone with some emotional elements in the film too. Zachery Levi was comedy gold in this film and definitely stole the show. The other actors as well (particularly Darla the little girl) definitely didn’t be reduced to the cutting room floor and had enough screen time. Most if not all the humor stuck the landing for me and even the heartwarming moments worked SO well for me and didn’t seem too melodramatic. Zachery Levi and Mark Strong had excellent classic super hero vs bad guy chemistry and didn’t seem too forced. Even the pacing didn’t drag despite being around 2 hours. This is everything I wanted from a DCEU film and more. I would give Shazam! A 90/100
2147,8,-This movie is so good! It has hilarious jokes and touching scenes. I loved it so much!
2148,8,"-I personally love the movie along with thousands of other people who had the blessing of seeing the classic movie, but there is a bit of cussing and inside jokes that some people might understand. Most kids at the age of 8 has at least heard swearing somewhere before so that's why I think 8 is the appropriate age to see Shrek. Children learn about puberty somewhere around the age of 8, so I think it's safe to say that it is an appropriate age to see Shrek."
2149,8,-shrek is love shrek is life i think shrek just took your wife
2150,8,-inapproipae
2151,8,-shrek is love. shrek is life
2152,8,"-Shrek Is an Amazing Movie I have always loved this movie and the whole series, in general, this movie still is funny till this day  Eddie murphy as Donkey is so fun to be around in this movie also Shrek Is so Good The best he has ever been Lord Farquad is a believable villain All the performances is good also all of them are not much to say such a classic to Watch I Give Shrek An A+"
2153,8,"-preceding the middling Shrek The Third , the fan favorite Shrek 2 and my personal favorite Shrek Forever After "
2154,8,-I saw this movie when I was 8 it was on Cartoon Network though never watched the whole entire thing I noticed something inappropriate for a kids film & A PG Rating but well but before that I never heard those until I noticed one & then I watched a video of the cursing scenes with occasional Mild profanity as it’s used a whole lot While the violence or anything inappropriate isn’t too much the Language is i’m giving this a PG-13 Rating Due to The Language.
2155,8,-I loved this and still do. Great movie!
2156,8,-Its fine but....There's a bit of swearing but there great messages and role modles. So i would belive this is for kids age 11 and up.
2157,7,-When I first watched this film I was a year old and my parents say I used to love it. I would watch shrek 3 times a day inless they had to go out. My parents couldn't believe it. That's probably why they told me.
2158,7,"-While simultaneously embracing and subverting fairy tales, the irreverent Shrek also manages to tweak Disney's nose, provide a moral message to children, and offer viewers a funny, fast-paced ride."
2159,7,-this movie was made before i was born but i still love it but also be warned that there is a lot of mild swearing for a kids movie but kids probably won't understand it.
2160,7,-I didn't see this movie when I was young unlike most other kids. And i've just recently watched it. I still found many scenes funny as the jokes appeal to almost every age. (Unlike that garbage movie: Alvin and the chipmunks)
2161,7,-Has great messages and a satisfying story.
2162,7,"-I thought that Shrek had a great story and was well written. However, there are uses of 'ass', 'damn' and 'hell'. Also, Princess Fiona shows a bit of cleavage. Nothing too concerning but heads up for parents."
2163,7,"-I know I watched this a lot when I was little and I watched it on long road trips but I just watched it again with my little brother (age 5) and I am starting to notice: this movie has multiple adult jokes for older kids. Again I didn't remember anything from when I was younger so it should go over their heads. Swears said: damn, as*, crap, jack-as*, kiss-as*, stupid,  and a line said ""keep your feet of the grass wash your hands wipe your- face"" and another line that people keep reporting but I am 11 and I still don't understand so... It's fine. For violence there is a fire breathing dragon, knights fighting, and more fighting (not graphic) it's pretty funny and I wouldn't worry too much"
2164,7,"-Shrek is a sweet,funny film for all of the family. Donkey is very funny and has some good jokes and all the characters have strong personalities. This film has themes of inner beauty and acceptance. Overall it is a lot fun and I would recommend it for kids"
2165,7,-MOVIE INFO
2166,7,-Don't let your little one watch this movie unless you want you kids saying bad words that I don't care to repeat.  But other then that it's a really good movie!
2167,8,"-This is my favorite movie of all time. There is just one number that you shouldn't show your young kids. It's called ""Make 'em Laugh."" Cosmo Brown is just flipping off walls which might make your kid hurt themselves trying to do it. Other than that it's a great movie that you should watch."
2168,8,-I enjoyed the movie “Singin In The Rain” it was a comical movie. My favorite character was Cosmo he had a lot of funny moments. I think that kids will love to watch this movie because of how funny it is. My one favorite song was “Make Em Laugh” by Cosmo.
2169,8,"-I think that this is a good classic movie. Considering that it is a musical ,with catchy music,I didn't think that there was too much singing in it. The story wasn't to complex, but I still enjoyed watching the movie."
2170,8,"-A definite classic! There is a lot of kissing and a whole lot of singing. Many parts show behind the scenes of making a movie in the silent era. When they are approached with movies with audio, they need to get in position. It shows what is needed for a show to go on with some what I would call unnecessary singing."
2171,8,"-This movie is great. For a G rating it does have some smoking, kissing, and some comical violence in the Make ‘Em Laugh! scene but not any other bad stuff"
2172,8,-A classic for the Whole Family that is just great
2173,8,"-Singin' in the Rain is a wonderful classic musical for the whole family. There are several kisses, and champagne and cigars are shown. Also there are some suggestive outfits, for only a few shots though. The worst the language gets is ""dumb"" and ""dope"". An awe-inspiring soundtrack and a whimsical storyline make this musical about American stardom in the 1920's a fantastic film everyone is sure to love."
2174,8,"-'Singin' in the Rain' has countless times been named the greatest musical ever made, and of course there are many reasons for this: all of its songs are memorable, it features the most iconic song-and-dance routine in film history, and it celebrates talent, creativity and imagination. Some of the comic elements in the film may be too sophisticated for children under 10, but the music is universal (and the main focus of the film anyway). A loving tribute to Hollywood and its fickleness, there are some self-centred, manipulative characters and passionate romantic moments to stay aware of."
2175,8,"-Love it, love it, love it, love it, love it. Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooove IT."
2176,8,"-CSM doesn't always include everything. Did nobody notice that Olga's dressed inappropriately?(She's only shown in two scenes.) Also, this girl on a poster isn't dressed appropriately. (That's only one 10- second scene.) I love Lina! Also, Don and Kathy kiss 2 times, but that's all. Also, Lina says 2 insults: dope and dumb."
2177,7,-I think this movie is the best for 5 year olds it’s not as bad as u think it is
2178,7,-Small Foot is just a masterpiece. It's really adorable as well! definetly would recommend if your into fictional creatures
2179,7,-I thought the music was great and the movie was really cute.  I would watch it 3 more times.
2180,7,-This was a fun family movie! The musical numbers were great and it had a very solid storyline. I found it very entertaining and fun.
2181,7,"-It is very funny and interesting and also sad .It is fine,so the parents can watch it with there kids."
2182,7,"-I will admit, it was better than I expected. Really good for a kids movie, funny and cute, although a little predictable and silly. Music was so-so. In no way did it come off anti-religious, to me, a religious teen. Totally worth the watch for a fun family movie night."
2183,7,"-My 160,000,000 year old cranked that Zendata managing the data in movies to be less effective. Excuse me, I think gothic teens will might be bored! ;P Okay, I will capture the Bigfoot in the 1970s instead! #ZendayaRants"
2184,7,"-An unbelievably great movie, a list of laughs a mile long!"
2185,7,"-Smallfoot is a good movie that you can watch with friends or family, no violence or scary scenes there is about two or three sad parts in it, and one part with tranquilizers, but aside from that the movie is fun and it will not give any children nightmares the next night hopefully, so do not be worried if they say they will be scared if they watch it"
2186,8,"-Song of the Sea is a beautifully told story. although the film is based around a little boy who is cruel to his sister and some parts include strange creatures that might make younger kids scared, it is a great family movie. the animation is incredible and will be very inspiring to young artists."
2187,8,"-This is a movie that is worth re-watching again and again. I say that it is for ages six and up because anyone younger would not appreciate it, but it is appropriate for all ages."
2188,8,-I loved this movie. The graphics and story were beautiful. I strongly recommend watching it.
2189,8,"-its so cute and extremely good, just a little creepy though"
2190,8,"-Violance: some mild peril. In the beginning, the audience is left to believe that a woman died. A boy gets almost hit by a car but the act is possibly played for laughs. An antagonist's animals tries to take a child but is protected by other characters and the characters turns to stone by the animals but the child is safe and leaves. Sexy stuff: a wife kisses her husband (brief.) Profanity: Ben makes several religious exclaminations, like ""holy molly!"" and ""Jesus Maria and Josef"" ""feic off"" is written on a door, but i didn't know what it meant, and other children would probably not focus on that. Drinking/drugs/smoking: Conor drinks at a pub in one scene (brief) which seems to be a habit for him since grandma said something like: ""where were you? drinking at the pub?"" no other reference of pub drinking is made. Personally, i think younger kids can watch it for the beautiful animation and soundtrack, but the story might go over younger kids heads. But the csm's age rating is still understandable. a girl goes down to the sea at night alone and swims in one scene, Ben and maybe even Saorise's goal is to go from the city back to the lighthouse without supervision for the major part of the movie, a character's body slowly changes/""ages"", (the character's hair turns white and the body gets weaker.) Overall, a lovely movie that i recommend."
2191,8,"-Okay, not to be rude or anything but the Song Of The Sea is a odd movie. The Song Of The Sea is about An Irish youth discovers that his mute sister is a selkie. A half human half seal.  Who must find her voice and free supernatural creatures from the spell of a Celtic goddess. So the whole movie is hand drawn which makes all of them look creepy. Then the music is sooo weird. And not to mention the mom abandoned her family to go with the selkie pod! It was confusing, depressing and just plain weird. I think it might be super popular in Ireland..I just didn't think it was all that good."
2192,8,"-scary, great role  models, but it's good and you might  need to go past some parts "
2193,8,"-I think that this movie is very good, but is a little sad. I would definitely watch this again. The drawings and sound are incredible. Very good."
2194,8,-This movie is really great. It is very complex and I had a hard time understanding the story but the imagery in this movie is unbelievable. I would not recommend this for younger children as the story is very complex and the plot deals with a heavy subject.
2195,8,-I liked the Song of the Sea. It was grate and a litel scarey but other than that it was good.
2196,8,"-In the movie it says ""hell"", and almost said ""son of a b*""."
2197,8,-Its a good movie i dont have anything else to say
2198,8,-This movie has a lot of stuff
2199,8,"-The movie was exciting and if you liked sonic or not you would like it a lot, it had good mix of scenes and makes the viewer intrigued on the movie and I think it would be for kids 9+ but it does have a bit of violence so if you don't like violence you might not like it as much and overall it was a good movie."
2200,8,-Plot: Sonic is alone on planet earth after fleeing from a tribe that tried to capture him as a child. When the government discovers Sonic they hire Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey) to track him down. Sonic acquires the help of his friend Tom (James Marsden) to help him get back to his home planet.
2201,8,-I liked it. Some unfinished cursing. Quite good.
2202,8,"-fantastic, it had a lot of good things and it was a little good and a little good, but if you take one good away it is terrible. Scientificly people think that this movie is good, the end"
2203,8,"-Parents need to know that this film is really good. James Marsden plays a character very similar to his in Hop, which could confuse younger viewers. There is a lot of peril/action. In one scene someone drinks. There is lot's of positive messages and role models. Some cut-off swearing like ""son of a -----"" and ""what the ----"". Lot's of consumerism. The whole movie is an avritisement for the video game."
2204,6,"-I found the humor rather boring and bad, a lot of random swearing and such. Wouldn't recommend at all but defiantly not for kids under 13."
2205,6,-There is lots of swear words as well as groin related jokes however if your kids are mature enough to no whats not appropriate and what is as well as if your okay maybe covering your kids eyes in a couple of seams. But other then that its a great movie that well leave you laughing.
2206,6,"-Spaceballs is a 1987 comedy movie directed by Mel Brooks and starring Rick Moranis, Bill Pullman, Mel Brooks, John Candy, and Daphne Zuniga."
2207,6,"-This is a decent comedy spoof. It is funny and interesting to see how the original Star Wars characters are portrayed in this parody. The movie has some mild innuendo and a good amount of language including f-ck once, sh-t, and asshole. It’s laugh-out-loud hilarious, but it’s only a 3 star movie."
2208,6,-this is the best mel brooks move. is is much funny.
2209,6,"-This is a good movie, but more for the older audience"
2210,6,"-This spoof on classic science-fiction movies can be very dumb and wacky, but that's what makes it so unique. The humor used throughout has very wacky concepts to it, but yet these concepts are very innovative when used, and are able to effectively satirize Star Wars, Alien, and more, with successful results. "
2211,6,-Spaceballs is a great Mel Brooks comedy with a laugh in a minute guarantee by all of the comedy lovers.
2212,6,"-Spaceballs is actually the first spoof movie I ever saw, and it was very funny, and in a creative way. Sure, some of the humor is predictable, but all of the humor is very creative. Mel Brooks has created humor that NO ONE has ever thought of doing. Like, when Dark Helmet accidentally hits a cameraman with his “Schwartz”, it is very creative and hilarious. Mel Brooks, Rick Moranis, John Candy and Bill Pullman were perfect for their roles and gave me something to laugh at several times throughout the movie. However, it gets pretty dirty halfway through. "
2213,8,-Before no way home I have decided watching all of the spider man movies. AS I SAJD BEFOFE I BARELY remember this series so I went in this expecting a great experience and it was good
2214,8,-has stilzied action/violence
2215,8,-Cinematography/Visuals: 4/5
2216,8,-It’s a fine movie and has a good villain. It’s not as violent as the first movie.
2217,8,"-I watched Spider-Man 2 back when I was probably 4 or 5. I remember the losing powers scene and just how good of a movie it was. But, going back to the movie 8 years later just shows how harsh it actually is. Let me give you a brief idea of what I think is harsh in this movie. Let me know what you think."
2218,8,-I love this movie but it is violent and has long kissing scenes.
2219,8,"-How is this ok for kids? The wife sees a pane of glass hurtling towards her, the entire emergency room staff are gutted. We stopped watching when the grandmother was dropped offa building. Not ok for kids."
2220,8,-Wow spider man 2 is the best spider man movie ever it was amazing I watched this movie when I was 7 and I loved it doc ock is a great villain the actors are amazing cgi was great for the time cgi still holds up kinda and I totally recommend this movie but if this is your kids 1st pg13 movie then I would go for spider man homecoming then this movie
2221,8,-The only scene that you have to worry about is the medic scene it’s not scary it’s very violent for young kids and the concept of it is scary.
2222,8,-Not for younger kids but for older kid (teens and tweens) perfect. Spider-Man 2 is one of my favorite movies.
2223,8,-Spider-Man  3 may not not be the best of the series but it  is still really good and is a enjoyable  action-packed blockbuster that you won't  wanna miss.
2224,8,-This movie has too much violence. It gave me nightmares. I had a nightmare of a character named Venom. I think this movie should be rated R for intense action violence.
2225,8,"-The only reason why this movie gets so much hate, is because the critics weren't having it. It truly is spectacular how movie critics can sway the popular opinion surrounding a movie as great as Spider-Man 3. After overcoming various obstacles in the previous two movies, Peter Parker (Spider-Man) is in the prime of his life. He's with the girl of his dreams, the city of New York loves him, and he's just been given the key to the city. Peter eventually lets his pride get to him, and he becomes oblivious to the troubles that those closest to him are facing. This lack of self-awareness leads to the untimely break-up between him and MJ, and makes him susceptible to the symbiote suit, which latches on to him halfway through the movie. This event gives rise to the black suited Spider-Man and consequently a cockier, and even more oblivious emo-styled Peter Parker. In exchange for enhanced powers and confidence, Peter gives his humanity and kindness which made him who he was in the previous two movies. His newfound ferocious nature leads him to ferociously beatdown on Sandman, and after believing that he has killed him, Peter returns to his apartment.  After a dispute with his beloved landlord, Mr. Ditkovich, Peter realizes that the black suit is bad for him and promptly puts it away. Mr. Ditkovich then helps Peter out by giving him some advice on how to flirt with MJ which includes the famous lines: ""You are good woman, I am good man."" From then on the movie becomes all the more action-packed leading to a thrilling climax at the end where Peter teams up with Harry to fight both Sandman and Venom. Would recommend to all, buy this movie, and show it to your kids!"
2226,8,"-Spider-Man 3 is a good movie. It’s still a competent addition to the Raimi Trilogy, but it’s undoubtedly the worst in it. I used to really like this movie, but upon re-watching it, my opinion changed. I still had fun with it, but there was a lot of bad parts in the movie, probably more so than good parts. The characters seem pretty different from the first two, and the story is so rushed that it’s hard to get invested in this film. "
2227,8,"-This was personally my favorite of the three spider-man movies, its theme was a little more mature than the other two, spider-man aka peter parker almost goes evil in one section of the movie, and it might be upsetting for kids when harry tries to kill peter in the end. But peter fights the temptation of becoming evil."
2228,8,"-Okay, great movie. It has three villains: Hobgoblin, Venom, and Sandman. I don't know what they were thinking with including Hobgoblin and Venom. They let Hobgoblin get a good play in the end but, Venom? No. It was nice to have Venom as a side-villain but they did a great job with Sandman."
2229,8,"-Probably the best of the three, this movie is quite a bit more intense than the first two, if your kid was a little scared of the first two, wait until he/she is 8"
2230,8,"-Parents need to know that this is the third film in the Spider-Man franchise. It has lot's of violence. Peter has some scary nightmares. Peter is really mean in some scenes and strikes someone he loves. SPOILER ALERT: Many important characters die including one character who is a minor villain, but a main character, as well as a main character from the other two films (That one is really sad). Lot's of ""I am going to mary someone else"" or ""I will date your girlfriend"" kind of thing. Good Movie. The evil goo might scare younger viewers."
2231,8,"-there is so much stabbing, not so much cursing though if a kid under 8 watched it they would get nightmares"
2232,6,"-Pros: Plot was nice, there was a lot of humor, and it teaches nice lessons like unity and friendship. Also, good animation."
2233,6,-More for younger kids
2234,6,"-I’m a very simple girl. I instantly love almost everything at watch/read. But this? This has gotta be the first piece of media (excluding music)  that has weirded me out. And even then I rate it 3 stars. Anyways, as for anything parents should be concerned about: "
2235,6,-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! His hand shrinks!
2236,6,"-When I watched this I expected something funny or sad or something, but I got garbage. It has enough potty humor and nude scenes to make a five year old laugh for days. There were no surprises or anything that would shock the viewer, so don't waste your time with it."
2237,6,"-There's nothing really inappropriate in spies in disguise. There is a scene with a naked man but you cant see anything to bad. you do see his butt very clearly but besides that there's no bad nudity. There is a normal amount of violence for a animated kids action/comedy movie.  As usual there's gross jokes and humor that will entertain a 5-8. That pretty much raps up my review, the sad thing is that they had so much potential with this movie and they did nothing with it, such talented voice actors to, really a shame."
2238,6,-Super good it funny and surprising you should watch this your kids will love it
2239,6,"-Fun movie with nice story.  Some parents comments are exagerated. This is a nice, fun movie to watch."
2240,6,-Spies in Disguise is a great movie. It is a funny movie and a little sad. It is a great adventure story! Wilbur is a great role model.
2241,6,-not funny but super funny haha i loved it
2242,6,"-I have seen on here that some parents are leaving reviews of 18+!!!!!! Like really?! This is such an awesome movie! How is it disgusting?? It has a picked on nerdy kid who saves the day! And plus, it is unlikely friends that do it together! It is a kids movie, and the “naked” parts aren’t even that bad, for you to be covering your kids eyes! And those who are saying the boy said “Fifty Shades of Yeah!”, how is that bad, if I may ask? It is not like he is saying “Fifty Shades of Grey!”. There are some dramatic people out there that don’t deserve to write reviews on here. It is just made to be funny, especially for kids! If you say you wasted your money, maybe you should have read the reviews, and then maybe considered- instead of just watching the movie and leaving a horrible an over-exaggerated review! Very disappointed in some of these reviews! ugh!"
2243,6,-I love this film! I think it should be a TV show!
2244,6,"-It was meh, Tom Holland is always great, but there were moments that were a bit cringe. They had some millennial memes under disguise, there was a scene of nudity that was uncomfortable, oh god don't get me started on the sumo thing. It just made me and the very very Christian homeschool girl I'm friends with super uncomfortable. "
2245,6,"-Spies in disguise is a great movie in almost every way. Will Smith and Tom Holland knock it out of the park with voice acting, it has detailed animation, it is hilarious, and it might just be one of my favorite movies. Expect some more mature themes though. Lots of violence and people dying (not on screen, but implied), many moments where characters almost swear, and there is some drinking. This movie is a must watch, please watch it!"
2246,6,"-I think this movie is very very funny, but there is a scary when the guy shows his robot self."
2247,6,-Great movie with lots of jokes. Love the cast not a lot of “bad stuff”
2248,6,-best family film ever
2249,8,"-This movie... supercalafragilisticexpialodocious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I loved this movie! I thought it was just stunning! The animation, the storyline... But there is violence like kicking, punching, spy stuff. Mild language, such as hell, heck and the f-word but it is beeped out."
2250,8,-This movie is very   funny.
2251,8,-Great movie with Will Smith and Tom Holland!!!
2252,8,-This is so awesome
2253,8,"-Scene where some male figure shows nudity - almost to the point of revealing the male gentalia.    - I was disgusted and couldn't believe the detail in art work that was sexually explicit.  The ""f"" was bleeped and totally unnecessary - why pretend to use a cuss word as a bleep - it was annoying -  just filth in my opinion.  The majority of the humor is towards a younger age audience but the scenes I mentioned just took away from the humor and makes this a movie not a great pick for kids.   I told my mom not to let my younger siblings watch it."
2254,8,"-Although ""Spies in Disguise"" is a very comedic movie with great voice actors, it has lots of violent scenes that make you say ""Ouch!"" or ""Oooo!"" out loud while watching the movie. My parents really enjoyed ""Spies in Disguise,"" so I guess there are mixed feeling about it, but every movie has different people watching it w opinions, right? If you are looking for a very funny kids spy movie and you don't care about watching some characters battle it out, then this movie should be your top pick."
2255,8,-it is hilarious but when there in kamora's apartmant they say hands up and see kamora's butt little kids find it funny though
2256,8,-I am 14 years old and I watched it with my family and enjoyed it nd laughed. This Animation is suitable for all ages and i totally recommend.
2257,8,-It's very good. it's really funny. It has potty humor and has some peril but overall has great messages and roll models.
2258,8,-Parents need to know that this movie is very good.
2259,7,"-i love all the Japanese films from studio ghilbi and this was one of my favorites. the beautiful animation and characters are a masterpiece and the story is amazing. though the movie is beautifully done, some scenes are bloody and violent."
2260,7,"-This is a really good movie! It's about a girl who's parents are turned into pigs. She tries to find them but there a lot of other things that she has to do. This movie can be creepy, but not too creepy. However there are a few scary parts, so if you have a child who gets scared easily,this movie might not be great for them."
2261,7,-i think its a wonderfull movie but maybe a little of a lot of violence
2262,7,"-Beautiful movie cool story but can be scary when a dragon gets hurt, and is bleeding all over the place."
2263,7,"-This is my absolute favorite movie of all time! However, I would NOT recommend this for children under the age of 10 or children that get creeped out easily. There are several extremely disturbing characters, such as No Face, a spirit that goes crazy and eats people. His appearance may also be frightening to some viewers. The parents turn into giant pigs at the beginning, which could also frighten children. However, the 10-year-old main character is very brave and goes through lots of solid character development throughout the movie (she goes from being bratty and lazy to being brave and kind), and the one of the themes that I personally took from the movie was kindness."
2264,7,"-It may be a little bit creepy for younger children, but i LOVE IT. There is a few parts like a frog smoking, the baby's butt is not covered,  a boy in dragon form getting attacked by paper birds and bleeding and throwing up blood and almost bleeding to death, and a creature named No-face luring people with gold and eating them. I have no idea how 7 year olds could be scared by this. Just make sure that your child is mature enough to not be scared by ghosts and things. Just know that this is 5 stars!"
2265,7,"-Yes, Princess Mononoke is good, Howl's moving castle is good. But they do not come close to this film. Spirited away is a great movie. I think ages 10+ will really enjoy it.  There is nothing bad in it, although when No face becomes crazy and starts to eat people that might scare some younger kids but it is not too bad."
2266,7,"-Spirited Away is a beautiful movie, one that makes you immediately want to watch it again. The soundtrack is lovely , the characters are all memorable and likable (even the bad guys) and visually, the movie is stunning. "
2267,7,-I am 7 years old and I have watched spirited away. For me it is  6 and up. But I can see how other people may not  like it and be scared of it. SUPER AWSOME AND EXCITING!
2268,7,-Just the right combination of fantasy and comedy.
2269,7,"-VIOLENCE, SCARINESS, AND GORE - People are turned into mutant creatures for a kid's TV show in the movie. The show also has a lot of fingers designed to look like humans. Might creep kids out. No blood."
2270,7,"-Exciting family-friendly tale with some violence, peril."
2271,7,"-Pretty solid film, but there is one scene where the mom of the kids whispers into the dads ear to persuade him. This is a bit sexual."
2272,7,-This movie is very boring and bad. The sister character is annoying and unlikable. This is one of the most overrated and boring movies I’ve ever seen.
2273,7,"-AMAZING film, but bewarned of one almost 4 letter word."
2274,7,"-Spy Kids was my favorite movie as a kid, and I still love it today. I used to watch it all the time when I was younger. This movie has a lot of great role models. Yes, it's a little stupid, but overall it was very ahead of its time. It has good representation (strong female leads, Hispanic family) a good plot, and it's enjoyable to watch. I strongly recommend this movie for all ages. Some younger kids could be startled by the fooglies and they could not understand the plot."
2275,7,-GREAT. Six year olds can really enjoy this amazing film. Even the grown up spies are GREAT. Yeah suitable for six and over.
2276,7,-THIS WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS. Stand by me is a sweet movie about four 12 year olds go on a quest to search for a dead body. A ton of strong language is used. It is one of my favorite movies. My favorite kid is teddy. I would rather let kids watch this then disney crap. While the boys search another group and up beating the boys to the body . Gordy pulls out a gun. None of the groups take this body. Later the body if found and neither of the groups is given credit. Amazing movie with awesome !
2277,7,"-This movie follows four best friends going on possibly their last adventure together. There is quite a lot of cussing. But as Wil Wheaton said, ""Parents who think their kids don't cuss are just fooling themselves."" This movie is amazing and perfect for growing teens. I would recommend to anyone who cares to see it."
2278,7,"-This is an example of a rating completely baffling me. If this didn't have the F bombs and smoking it would be PG. I actually encourage you to show any kid 6 and up this movie, it's rated so unfairly. Realistic language that 12 year old boys actually speak (I should know). A few kids smoke cigarettes, but if your kid has seen someone smoke in real life it's no different. Where's your kid going to get cigarettes anyway? A few kids talk about tits (again, like we actually do in real life). At the end a dead body is seen, not too graphic, a little blood. The movie has great messages behind it, like friendship and loyalty, and even just doing the right thing. The main character is a great role model, except for the smoking."
2279,7,-people die and kids do drugs but still one of the best
2280,7,"-This is a fantastic movie. I've seen this countless times since I was around 8. I have two younger siblings whom have grown up watching it. While there is plenty of swearing, some smoking, and it really evolves around a search for a murdered body, I really think that the overall message of friendship and loyalty, hence the name Stand By Me, over powers it all. And yes, there are sexual innuendos, like most shows and movies these days. They will fly over the younger audience's heads. I really think that if your child has been exposed to any media violence and rough language, this movie is fine for them to watch."
2281,7,"-Great movie. I watched it when I was 10, first R rated movie. It has strong lenguge 11-f words 1-10 uses of p---y 1 use c--k possibly 1 use of c--t. This also has four 12 year old boys talk about sexual stuff (boobs,etc).eight 18 year old boys talk about getting laid. 12 year olds carry around around a 45 caliber. Very intense but still if your kid has played gta4or5 they will love this movie"
2282,7,"-The movie is funny, clever, depressing, adventurous, and chilling all at the same time. Don't let the R rating put you away from the film. There is some strong language but there are lots of positive messages of growing up strong with others. A great classic!"
2283,7,"-stand by me is a great movie,but has a lot of language and smoking."
2284,7,"-I think this is completely okay for early teens.  As far as the language goes, that's what 12 and 13 yr olds actually talk like.  There are some references to  child abuse, both physical and emotional, but it's not bad at all.  Stand By Me is the perfect movie for teens."
2285,7,-It's a great movie about 4 boys who act older as their adventure goes on.Interesting movie about how kids grow up and become teenagers
2286,8,"-I didn't think this series could get any better, but it does!!!! This movie kind of shows up the previous one, but the first one sets up nicely for this one."
2287,8,"-Star Trek Into Darkness is a 2013 sci-fi movie directed by J. J. Abrams and starring Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Benedict Cumberbatch, Alice Eve, Simon Pegg, and Leonard Nimoy."
2288,8,"-JJ Abrams is a good director. His best attributes have to be his attention to detail, intricacies in characters, and intense suspense. "
2289,8,"-Overall, this movie is very good. At the discretion of parents, I would not allow a kid to watch this movie until they are AT LEAST 14. "
2290,8,"-This film has a lot of violence and is very intense. There is strong punching kick shooting stabbing and more. On one bit a guy crushes a mans head and stamps on a whoman lying on the floor. She then has to go to hospital meaning it was A bad injury. On one fight scene there is very strong violence and a man gets his neck snapped. They are also being continuously punched and being slammed against walls. It is very stressful and intense. There is bad language used very often including bloody, bastard, bitch, shit, ass, crap, damn and more. The language is not as bad as the first one because that one has an F bomb at the beginning. Going back to the violence there is some blood. Whomen are shown in bed topless with men and there is lots of underwear. For mature 10 year olds or 11 year olds. There is great messages and role model as the captain dies to save his crew. Spoiler alert.. he comes back to life. Also enemies become friends in the film. There is also drinking at a bar."
2291,8,"-Omagersh this movie was absolutely terrible! The plot was really only for a *gasp* for the audience. They were more concerned with the *gasp* than the ""Wow. That was really interesting! It's certainly making me think!"""
2292,8,-Amazing movie. I think the storyline is amazing and the acting is superb. J.J Abrams did an amazing job on this film if it even is a little bit violent.I think little kids may not like this movie as it is a bit scary for their age group.Their is a few s--t  and a word very close to the F-word. This 2 and a half hour movie is great and definitely worth your time.
2293,8,"-This was a an excellent second movie!!! It was not disappointing at all!!!!! There were some creepy parts, but they really weren't too bad!!! Overall it is a fantastic movie to watch!!!!!!  :)"
2294,8,"-My rating hard PG-13: for graphic nudity, racy content, language, and some bloody violence."
2295,8,-great
2296,8,-I am a Apple Fan and I honestly love this movie. It tells about how we got the device that we know and love today. However try watching it together if you have a 6-7 year old as it does contain some language.
2297,8,"-Why is everyone making a huge deal about the appropriateness of this movie? It's literally just swearing. And I've heard WAY more swearing in other movies. By age 8, I'd heard all these words before. It's not like kid's will watch this movie and suddenly start cussing! At one point Jobs asks his assistant, ""Why haven't we slept together?"" which is the only reference to sex in the entire movie."
2298,8,"-I think the format of this movie is really interesting. When I started to watch it I thought it was going to be like every other bio-pic, but I actually found it very engaging! I also think the casting is great especially Michael Fassbender!"
2299,8,"-There is no other film with such perfect timing and dialogue. An overwhelming sense of emotion is tirelessly infused within the script. The acting portrays not just the characters but human stories that all can relate with. The music is a collision, much like Jobs, of creativity yet also pause. This film is a miracle."
2300,8,"-A TON OF UNNECESSARY CUSSING!! Buuuuuut if your kid can handle it, its ok. I watched it because my dad worshiped him lol. It was a good educational movie."
2301,8,"-Michael Fassbender's portrayal and Danny Boyle's direction really shine here as both of them show brilliant roles in their part.  Aron Sorkin's dialogue also is amazing. Also, the cinematography is brilliant and was amazing to see that in the first act a 16 mil lens was used than a 18 mil lens in the second act ans then was shot on digital cameras to show the progression of technology."
2302,8,"-This was a really interesting movie because it  didn't have any plot at all. it was basically just Steve Jobs launching three different products with no flashbacks showing you his past life or careers at all. Whether you're intrigued or utterly confused at that type of filmmaking is a matter of personal opinion. However, what is NOT a matter of personal opinion is the frequent usage of strong language such as ""f--k"", ""s--t"", ""a--hole"", and the like. Also, something that CSM didn't cover (which is part of the reason I'm writing this review) is that a Time magazine interview in which Steve Jobs joked that 28% of American men slept with his wife and therefore produced his daughter (which later comes back at him) is referenced a lot, especially towards the beginning. Overall, the film isn't that bad content-wise, especially for an R-rated movie, and is appropriate for teens to see (if it holds their interest, that is). My MPAA rating: R for language."
2303,8,"-Though this is my favorite movie, The Language has some d*mns, "
2304,8,-It Is Cute And Freindly
2305,6,"-Well honestly, this seems a perfect movie for a five year old. For a G movie it's violent for little ones because"
2306,6,-I was really dissapointed. Women shouldn't be showing of their elbows all the time. It's disgusting. A woman should be modest. My 10 year old son couldn't stop ogling those elbows. It was awful.
2307,6,"-It is rated G, and a great movie."
2308,6,-This movie is kind of good. Kids will love this Disney/cartoon movie. This movie is kind of funny and has humor. Though this movie is kind of intense. Shooting is involve. There is some brief cruleness. Mild sex is involve.
2309,6,-Good example of a golden age Disney movie.
2310,6,"-I just want to say, there is SO much death in this movie! First, Tarzan's parents are unceremoniously eaten by a leopard within the first five minutes, and you can see bloody pawprints surrounding them. Then, a little baby gorilla is out with his family, and he chases a butterfly away from his parents. We're all thinking ""Aww, what a little cutie, maybe this will be a sweet movie after all!"" And then the leopard comes. The father gorilla knows they won't be able to save the baby, so he holds the mother gorilla back. The poor little baby gorilla is eaten by the leopard (offscreen, but you can still hear the poor thing screaming in pain, and the mother gorilla just hides her face against her husband/mate and cries). Then, at the end of the movie, the alpha gorilla is shot and killed, leaving poor Tarzan heartbroken, but in charge of the gorilla troop. And then, in the worst Disney death EVER, the hunter guy (gah, I can't remember his name...) gets tangled in vines, and tries to cut himself free. Little does he know there is a vine entwined around his neck, and he basically hangs himself by mistake. You see him plummeting and screaming, and then the screen pans to Tarzan's shocked face. Then a convenient little flash of lightning illuminates the villain's dead body. I know that villains should be punished, but that seems a bit far, don't you think? ANYWAYS, the reason I gave three stars instead of one is that the plotline of Tarzan learning how to be human is really sweet and funny. Also, I love the music, especially ""Trashing the Camp"" (EARWORM ALERT!!) So, if your kids can handle the gore and death, I think this is a pretty good movie. Still, I wish that not as many characters died. That kind of ruined it for me, as I am very sensitive about that kind of thing...(I'm not saying I hate this movie. In fact, I think it's pretty good. I just get kind of upset whenever anyone dies.) (P.S, Watch ""Trashin' the camp"". Look at that teapot. IT'S MRS. POTTS!!! I freaked when I saw that. LOL)"
2311,6,"-This movie is very frightening but older kids, 10 to 12 year olds, will love it. In one scene, Tarzan cuts open a leopard and Kerchack's death is very sad. There are some good messages like that characters can fit in even when they are from different places.  Though most of the good messages are blocked out by guns there are still a few more like that you may get injured when saving your friends but it is worth it.  Clayton is very scary.  His actions involve killing a few gorillas.  His death is very violent.  Overall it is a good movie for tweens."
2312,8,-I saw the premiere at the beach then my sister watched over and over again it was a movie about Mack (Maia Mitchell) and Brady (Ross Lynch) I thought fallin for you was pretty catchy but I hated the rest of the movie I couldn't get past 30 minutes don't bother with this movie watch High School Musical if you like musicals and Disney channel
2313,8,"-I personally thought this movie was cute, fun, and enjoyable! I really don't see how it can be considered inappropriate in any way, there isn't even any kissing. The romance between Brady and Mac is so subtle that I didn't even realize that they were more than friends until they mentioned a possible breakup. And for the people complaining about the ""revealing"" swimwear, they are at the beach?! What do you want them to wear, full bodysuits? The bathing suits are 60's fashion, so I honestly think they are a lot more modest looking than current ones are, and you can see nude colored material at certain points that the actresses are wearing under their costumes, so nothing is revealed. For the love of god, your child isn't going to become a sex-crazed demon because they saw a girl's stomach. As for the plot itself, there are definitely plot holes, but none that really take away from the film. The whole mad scientist bit was just dumb and unnecessary, and I think everyone else can agree with that as well. The cast was pretty good, I don't really care that much for ross lynch, I felt like I was watching the same exact character from Austin and Ally. Everyone else was great though! There are tons of positive messages, cliche ones like ""follow your dream"", and ones I was pleasantly surprised by ""there is more to life than trying to attract boys"". The musical numbers were fun and catchy, overplayed a bit in commercials but that shouldn't be a surprise. Overall I really think this movie is safe for young ones, and fun for older kids too (my brother is 10 and loves it)."
2314,8,"-This movie never appealed to me at all, especially being an eleven yr. Old. The charachter cast and meager, confusing storyline makes for a performance that is far below disneys usual standards."
2315,8,"-This movie was HORRIBLE. It was corny, and had no real humor. 'Love', was basically directing this whole film, if you know what I mean. But the cheesy kind of love. Just kissing and all that. It was just so bad. "
2316,8,-It has a positive idea but is probably too childish for anyone over ten.
2317,8,"-People keep saying that the movie is very inappropriate-they don't curse once, there is no product placement and there is a great message. I mean, sure, there are bikinis and guys with their shirts off, but do you want to take your family to the beach? Well, that's what you're gonna see. Kids aren't gonna say ""I wanna be like Brady"" and take their shirts off. If you think kids are like sponges, know that sponges don't take their shirts off."
2318,8,"-This movie is terrible, it has a bad soundtrack and a horrible story plot. so I go down in a wave and come back up in a 1950's movie seems pretty fun to me. NOT! I would rather watch Baby Einstein for the rest of my life then Watch this movie again even though I only saw 30 minutes of it"
2319,8,"-this is a dumb movie.first,this movie is so not about 60s n everything seems like now.a lot of girl dress inapropriet(tall boots,shorts,bikinis).this movie is trying to make 60s look really modern and similar to today,but its not like that.watch west side story.that movie talks about racisam n another social problems in the 60s (and 70s).i think kids need to know the truth about the 60s.and disney always makes thing look better(hercules,sleeping beauty and another lies)."
2320,8,"-No matter what it's about, awesome movie! :)"
2321,8,-This is a great movie for kids all the way up to teens.  I watched this movie with my mom and she LOVED it.  It is a movie I would definitely recommend for all ages.
2322,8,-IT GIVES ME FLASHBACKS TO VIETNAM AND ALL OFF THE VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS THAT HID IN THE TREES HELP AHHHHHHHHH!

2324,8,"-THEY BE WEARING AMONG US MERCH, THATS PRETTY SUSSY!"
2325,8,-there is a babys face on the sun that is very disturbing and teaches 4 year olds how to speak gibberish and wierd disgusting crap as well dont watch it
2326,8,"-I watched this show as a tot, but I forgot about it when I was a toddler. I now remember it because of Common Sense, of the visible ""OUR EDITORS RECOMMEND"" section, same with Jungle Junction. But this is one of the weirdest shows I've ever experienced when I watched a video to remember what it was like, and I could not believe I was watching this..."
2327,8,"-God help me, I think I saw the Devil while watching this show. Although people say the Devil(or Satan) is bad, he enlightened me to know that he's a nice guy.  Et reversus est diaboli. Memento mori."
2328,8,"-I absolutely hate this show, irritating, disturbing, cringe, and teaches no educational value."
2329,8,-Common Sense Media? How can you give this three stars? This is the worst show ever. Annoying and this gave me a headache. 0 stars. Irritating. After watching this show I feel like throwing up.
2330,8,-User Chris the custom says his 2 year old little sister made custard and then added drugs in it? How and why does your two year old sister make custard? And how does she get the drugs to put in it?
2331,8,"-Teletubbies is really annoying. It teaches kids how to speak gibberish and the ""baby's face on the sun"" looks really weird and disturbing. Do not watch the show. Teletubbies' face looks really disturbing as well. No educational value in it. Not even 1 bit."
2332,8,-The whirlwind animated adventure is a visual treat for tweens.
2333,8,"-The Adventures of  Tintin has lots of adventure (you guessed it) and violence with pirates fighting, some blood and lots of guns. Also, the story is nice and ambiguous. Some may love this however what brings the movie rating down for me is that some scenes were too unreal and their was too much drinking. Once, a pirate captain got directly hit by lightning but he was completely fine afterwards. Also, the main character had been chased by pirates with guns at least ten times but did not get hit!!! The worst part was probably where the drinking! So much and even the dog got drunk!! This is way to unrealistic. (Did I mention the dog is as smart as a human and seems to understand english?)"
2334,8,-Unless you are prepared to deal with nightmares or acts of 'pretend violence' this movie is for you!
2335,8,-This movie is really fun! I like it! It's just a nice adventure movie to watch if you don’t want to watch something emotional. TINTIN MY BELOVED.  Great movie!
2336,8,-It is a good movie but they could have done it a little more entertaining.
2337,8,"-this movie is great but there are tons of guns, haddock is obsessed with alcohol and the blood on the newspaper seems really realistic for CGI"
2338,8,"-I remember watching this for the first time back 2011, and being absolutely blown away by the visuals. The writing was a lot more mature but fun."
2339,8,"-This is actually my favorite movie!(though I am bit biased due to the fact that it was my childhood movie) My parents didn't know that it was a more mature movie and brought me a long when I was 3.  the action and violence flew over my head and I didn't really know what was happening. Though I was not scared by it, I don't recommend that age! After I grew older and learned to appreciate this movie, I came to love it.  I found the books and it made the movie even more of a treat. Tintin is a great role model and is the best! Captain Haddocks drinking problem can not be ignored though. If you show it to kids you might want to inform about that and tell them it is bad. And if there is a child in the room you might want to tell them to close their eyes when the man is shot with a machine gun. Other than that the violence is mild with a few punches and missed gun shots."
2340,8,-This is pretty much appropriate for all ages- as long as you skip through the violent scenes.
2341,6,"-I say the violence only tentatively. Men get shot, stabbed, yet blood is only seen once. Most people hold guns/fire weapons. Haddock goes quite crazy after drinking, (and he drinks a lot.) Tintin is quite intelligent, resourceful, and tough. Thompson and Thompson are humorous in that they are slightly reminiscent of the three stooges. An interesting point is that only one woman is seen in the whole movie. She is only secondary, however. Also, a startling point is that no children are present whatsoever. Tintin may look young, but that premonition is quickly blown away."
2342,6,-I saw this movie when it came out in 3-D this movie kept my intrest in this movie but my mom was kind of bored in some parts. so take your kids to see this movie it like indiana jones met pirates of the caribbean.
2343,6,"-Like my title the books were way better, trust me I know I have them all even the ones not released in the US like Tintin in the Congo. The movie is still good and is a must see for any Tintin fan. The Rating is PG which is solid but it is leaning to PG-13, there is a man who gets shot partway into the movie and it shows him falling to the ground with some blood. Drinking is also a main theme in the movie, but the positive roll-models and the messages in the movie more then make up for the bad things age wise. This is a movie almost any age could see if they didn't mind some violence and a little blood. The humor is great. All in all a great movie for anyone."
2344,6,"-When Nickelodeon Productions popped out of no where with the hit movie, Rango, I was baffled. It had a great mystery, plot, and best of all, excellent CGI graphics. I loved it! "
2345,6,"-Steven Spielberg's long awaited and hotly anticipated new holiday movie (One of two, the other being War Horse, which I have yet to see myself) The adventures of Tintin, is, for all of the rave reviews, and huge foreign and worldwide box office success and the long year of hype and anticipation thrown at Spielberg's feet, it is just absolutely heartbreaking for me to report that I was greatly disappointing. And, to add, I have been a lifelong fan of the original Herge comics, so I am not exactly very new to the whole Tintin franchise in the first place.Tintin is very nice looking, in fact, it quiet possibly and very easily has by far the best use of motion-capture animation and computer animation technology that I have ever seen in any movie, thus far. But, that is the only good thing bout it. Tintin is a lifeless, extremely long and almost interminably dull movie that quit on the viewer long before it even gets to it's depressing futile ending. It appears that the magic of Spielberg's movies have been absent from his films for some six or seven years, now. Here just hoping that War Horse still has some of that left in it. But, despite being Rated PG and being marketed heavily and almost completely towards children, The Adventures of Tintin is certainly not for young kids:There is infrequent but very intense and brutal (for an animated movie) cartoon violence, with several rather harsh deaths and scenes which actually also have quiet of bit of animated blood. Also, there is constant, non-stop drinking and alcohol use and consumption in the form of the side-character of Captain Haddock, who is a great drunk. Finally, there is extremely infrequent mild language with only one use of real profanity in the entire movie, with that being in the form of d-mn. So, if you did, like many people did, happen to like it, than great. I just wish it could have been much better, than it unfortunately, and depressingly, was."
2346,6,"-The adventures of Tintin is great movie to see with family, friends, or by yourself. The main character is a young reporter who unknowingly falls into an adventure that takes him around the world. Tintin is well meaning and wants to help most people, but also fights when he has to. I don't think many people noticed but there aren't that many female characters, but that doesn't hold it back. It is violent at sometimes, one character getting machine gunned to death, but that's the most violence. One character is usually drunk and people don't like it, but he overcomes his alcoholism."
2347,6,"-Great animation. My rating: Intense action, crude humor, drinking, and a murder."
2348,6,"-The movie was very violent (lots of gun fights), dark, and confusing for children.  My 8-year-old daughter laughed out loud a few times, but she didn't understand the story -- the pace was fast, the vocabulary was often over her head, and the allusions obscure."
2349,6,"-This movie is definitely family-friendly, but as a 13-year-old, I was seriously disappointed. It went on too long and there were only 2 laugh-out-loud moments in the entire movie. It didn't really capture my attention because the storyline was hard to follow. I eventually got it, but it was just confusing. My personal opinion is that this movie was boring and would definitely be enjoyed more by younger kids."
2350,6,"-We run a pretty conservative household, and I took my 4-year old daughter and 6-year old son.  Bear in mind we have almost no computer time yet for them and very little TV....so our bar for acceptable media is pretty high.  I was a little concerned some of the content could be scary for my daughter, so we discussed in advance.   Both kids just loved the movie - it was not scary to either of them, and the ""violence"" was completely antiseptic in my view and not inappropriate at all.  Believe me, there's nothing appealing about Capt. Haddock's drinking - it's a lot more likely to push kids away from a drink than towards it.  Simply wonderful movie."
2351,8,"-The Amazing Spider-Man 2 may have a bit of mistakes, but this was my absolute favorite! I think what interested me was the Spider-Man costume, because it looked exactly like the same suit in the comics. This movie has been AMAZING for me! Andrew Garfield is awesome at Spider-Man and Emma Stone is great at acting as Gwen Stacy!"
2352,8,"-Some good messages (Think 'with great power comes great responsibility') But, sadly, consumerism. With AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 costumes to hats to MARVEL SELECT toys. Do not forget, McDonald's was a thing in this production BTW Andrew was my fave but now i am SUCH THE FAN of Tom Holland and even got a morphsuit of Tom Holland's Spidey suit"
2353,8,"-Not Really Violent, Not really Sexual but lots of Consumerism. The Plot is very Clunky but overall Parents i guess it’s okay to let your kids watch this"
2354,8,-Great Spider-Man movie. Does have a lot of violence but with really good role models
2355,8,-This movie isn’t that good. It has 3 villains and a bunch of plot holes that are confusing. Overall just don’t watch it. There are better spider man movies out there. As a huge spider man fan myself I feel a bit disappointed.
2356,8,"-This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Violence includes deaths of characters, disease, electric shots out of hands, gun shots, action, destruction, and bombs. Spider-Man is a really bad role model and is mean to others. This movie scarred history forever."
2357,8,"-Andrew Garfield stars as Spider-Man in this sloppy, forgettable Spider-Man movie. The plot is confusing, Electro is a villain because he has no friends and Peter Parker is a jerk to multiple people. Expect lots and lots of violence and kissing in the movie that tarnished the name of Spider-Man."
2358,8,"-This movie is GREAT!! But this is important.  In terms of language, I heard multiple use of goddamn and damn, about 3 uses of ass,  5 hell, and 1 Holy s--t. Violence includes neck snapping, explosions, gunfire, falling from heights, and choking. Overall, good movie but watch it with your kids."
2359,8,"-i don't know why critics are calling this the worst spiderman film this had a 52% on rotten tomatoes and guess what spiderman 3 had? a 63% honestly, critics these days. But listen to me instead this is actually really fun so skip spiderman 3 and watch this"
2360,8,-Number 1 of top 10 dramatic super heroes movies
2361,8,"-Good , but violent."
2362,8,-This movie is rated pg-13 for a couple of simple reasons violence is quite 
2363,8,-i think this is a great movie for everyone its pretty great
2364,8,"-WOOWOOWOWOWO! This is ""Amazing""! This is the best marvel movie I ever seen! I laughed and cried! It is violence but not so much blood showing. There are kissing one guy without shirt and a girl kissing. I LOVE Andrew (Peter Parker)!"
2365,8,-Awesome film! This film is really good and is fine for a kid to watch.
2366,8,"-Some violence: shooting, one stabbing. Movie is very entertaining and intense. Good storyline. Little kids will probably be scared. Overall, very good movie! 9+"
2367,8,"-As for why they made a reboot I am not sure as Spiderman 3 was fantastic, but as for the reboot there is lots of coming book violence but the new Peter Parker is a very positive role model for young kids."
2368,8,"-It's the same Spider-Man story with a different twist.  Peter's girlfriend's father is a police chief, and the villain is Peter's mentor.  I enjoyed it even more than the first; Andrew Garfield is cute and dorky, and his girlfriend, Emma Stone, plays your not-so-typical blonde.  Overall, charming and a must-see for Marvel nerds."
2369,8,-not as amazing as it looks but really promising for spidey fans like me!
2370,8,-A lot of action
2371,8,"-I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was original and entertaining. The first stories are very funny, filled with black humor, other parts were depressing, and other parts included splendid landscapes. However, it was quite violent for young teenagers. Violence is always very quick, but bloody. Some scenes include a man’s fingers getting blown out, a man getting shot in the neck with an arrow, a man getting scalped, and others. The movie had no sex or nudity, except for a prostitute getting hired for sex.  It had very low quantities of alcohol or drugs. Some of the characters were barbaric, violent, but others were light-hearted, optimistic, and funny. I would really recommend this to fanatics of western movies and black comedies (although not everything in this movie is comical)."
2372,8,"-film has no swearing , but some strong voilence makes it a 14 + but definetley a disapointment from joel and ethan coen. its no big lebowski"
2373,8,"-The Ballad of Buster Scruggs acts as an parody of classic Westerns while adding a unique twists on typical tropes. Like how Buster Scruggs  wares a white hat, a typical sign in classic Westerns that this is the good guy. But he obviously loves killing to a point its frightening, and he is not the good guy. While black hats mean the bad guy, the Kid wheres one, and he shows no real evil acts, and in the end he and Buster sing together and become allies. Now not all of them are like this as James Franco's segment is quiet, but still action packed. Some depictions of  Native Americans (Indigenous) are racist they work well for the movie, as it works with the hyper-critical nature of the view of the old west. The third segment was the best by far, as it showed emotional depth while there is barely a word spoken. The costumes and set design are phenomenal and everything culminating together this is a must watch."
2374,8,"-This movie is pretty good. However, I started to lose interest after the film’s fourth short film."
2375,8,-The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a great film with six episodes in a two hour time space. It was made by the Coen Brothers. The only problem in this film is violence but if you can handle violence in movies or just remember it's fake blood it's all ok.It should be fine for a twelve or thirteen year old.
2376,8,"-Do not bother watching this repetitive, boring, unnecessarily gruesome disgrace of a movie. It is well acted, but the whole story is without a plot, theme or even a main character, the trailer was really good and portrayed this film as being funny and an adventure, but it was not in any way amusing and had no adventure."
2377,8,"-Hilarious, brutal, sad and, dark. Some graphic violence so best for mature 12 or 13. Thought provoking messages though."
2378,8,"-Very good, Coen Brothers quality. Starts out very funny and progressively gets darker. Pretty violent but not consistent, and not overly-graphic, as in a Tarantino film. Language is minimal. Some stories are better than others, but overall very good. Occasionally confusing."
2380,8,"-I love this movie, I can’t say anything bad about it other than the fact that it could be a bit scary for younger a kids."
2381,8,-It’s okay overall there are some scenes of scares and mild violence.
2382,8,"-You’re going to think I am crazy for saying 9+ and 2 stars but I watched this when I was what, 7 or 8? and I didn’t like it. It was scary sometimes and boring all the other times. I made it through the whole movie (finally) when I was 8 or 9, but I wasn’t paying attention because it was SO BORING. UGH"
2383,8,-I love the book for this movie just as much.
2384,8,"-Of course, I love anything Roald Dahl inspired. The BFG is funny, lighthearted and has the beautiful message of believing in yourself even if you feel small. Beware: small children may be scared on the bigger giants who steal children from their beds and eat them."
2385,8,"-I love this movie, especially when the Queen's corgis go flying round and up the house!"
2386,8,-i read this book at school when i was 10 and i saw the movie when i ws seven years old this is an amazing book to read to kids and it is very entertaining
2387,8,-Boring and Confusing. This movie is so confusing only 11+ would know what's going on. NOT A FAN!
2388,8,-my mom thought the giants were a little bit scary but from my point of view it was a non scary silly adventurous movie.
2389,7,"-It’s a great variation of the book. It has a bit of toilet humour, but kids will love it! A bit of scariness, but not that much. I loved the slimy vegetables! All in all, it was pretty good!"
2390,7,-A bit boring but some bits can be funny the giant is well made and it seems real the acting rolls are not to bad depending on the scene
2391,7,"-The movie is a great idea it's perfect for children and even people who enjoy movies such as this, it's nothing like any other giant movie, i hope you'll like it as much as i did."
2392,7,"-This movie is amazing! They just don't make movies like this anymore, where it can be entertaining without cursing or inappropriate content. Pros: funny, no cussing, animation is breathtaking, plus the storyline is interesting for all ages. Cons: a whole scene is dedicated to fart jokes (but it was pretty funny though), violence that can scare small children, but besides that it's a great movie."
2393,7,"-For me, the movie was positively boring and not very exciting. For my mom and dad, they thought it was great. It definitely was not what I expected based on the trailers, however it has great heart and a positive message. Personally, I would not recommend it especially for younger kids. I think younger kids would find it too thought-provoking and a bit too slow and lack of magic."
2394,7,-the BFG was a very good movie.If you have toddlers or 6 and below kids I prefer not to watch with them.But otherwise sure!At times it can be dark or scary.At others they teach you lessons or it can be funny.
2395,7,"-""The BFG"" brings back to film industry to Steven Spielberg with a genuine work aimed at adults and infants that covets to has the same impact than the previous classics of the director, nevertheless, his film does not capture such pleasures."
2396,7,-This is a lovely movie for families. Some scenes might scare young children under 7. It was a bit boring but very good. Worth seeing it!!!!
2397,8,-Epic sequel has tons of action/violence.
2398,8,"-This is a great sequel and has a great plot but it is violent. There is also some swearing such as one use of f*cking, and a few uses of s**t, da*n, and a*s."
2399,8,"-The Bourne Supremacy - yeah, it’s not brilliant in my opinion, but it’s still a good action sequel and better than Identity, with more action scenes, but hopefully Ultimatum will be even better. There are some violent, brutal scenes (although not much blood) and an F-word, so I’d recommend this for ages 13 and up. Not bad. An improvement on the so-so first film."
2400,8,-This movie is pretty good. It’s the second Bourne movie and I enjoyed it a lot
2401,8,"-The Bourne Supremacy improves from the previous movie by doubling up the thrills, action and fun to make an even better sequel. This movie does have tons and tons of violence, but same as its first movie it is fine for older Tweens and up."
2402,8,-Language 4.5/10 - Violence 8/10 - Sexy Content 0/10
2403,8,"-This movie is brilliant. It is the second movie in the Bourne series. It is well-acted but pretty violent. Bourne is an easy model to root for, although he beats up and kills potential assassins and injures innocent bystanders in a heart-stopping car chase. One man shoots himself, but we are spared the full gore. Another man gets stabbed by a fellow agent. Jason fights another man, which ends up with strangulation. Jason's girlfriend is shot by an assassins bullet meant for him. "
2404,8,"-This is a pretty good movie with a hell lot of violence, blood, and killing. The language (son of a b----) is normal."
2405,8,"-The Bourne Supremacy is as outstanding as the first. With hard, intense action, which has my favorite scene in the film, the fight is the house. It was gripping and realistic since there was no music in the background until it was over, an excellent continuation of the story, great acting from Damon and new additions, Joan Allen, Brian Cox and Karl Urban and John Powell's score is great. Grade: A."
2406,8,"-My rating;R for strong violence, some racy content, alcohol use, and language throughout."
2407,8,-I watched this with my 12 year old cousin and he was fine the blood and gore is over the top but it is by unrealistic monsters it is a great film if you can handle blood
2408,8,"-Okay, first of all, I wanted to see this movie really badly. So I saw it. I hate this movie. I don't like movies when literally the whole thing is gallons and gallons of blood is just spurting out everywhere every 5 seconds. This movie is so stupid don't even think about wasting money to see this. It's pointless with pretty much no plot."
2409,8,"-""Cabin in the Woods"" doesn't go for the easy horror movie laughs that the ""Scary Movie"" franchise tries to elicit, but it is a curiously interesting satire on why horror movies can be so cliched and ridiculous at times. The movie itself isn't too scary, save for a few jump scares, but its wit keeps it afloat, and distinguishes it among other lesser flicks."
2410,8,"-Cabin In The Woods had a great concept, but I felt overall the actual movie was very weak and bland. Now on to the parents guide. I watched this movie knowing that it would have gore, and language, but I didn't know how gory this movie would be. It was pretty bad the first part of the film, but about the last thirty minutes of the film it is a total gore fest. There was one scene where in about two minutes in one room monsters escape and grisly kill the men in the room, and blood shoots on the roof, and on the wall, and floor, and people are ripped in half and dismembered and decapitated and eaten all in one room the violence made me shiver and one of my favorite movies are kill bill so strongly caution with 14. there  is also one scene of nudity and tons of drugs and language."
2411,8,-As the title said Cabin in the Woods is very dark. It can be very disturbing at points to. It was very well written though and it has a lot of humor. I enjoyed it a lot. It is a very good new take on the horror genre.
2412,8,"-The Cabin in the Woods adds new ideas to the horror genre which is falling apart, it is visually stunning not that scary, but the violence, language, sex and drinking makes it not recommended for under 15, this age specifically because it is more funny than scary, but it has a lot!"
2413,8,"-I really enjoyed this movie and thought it was clever. I didn't like the drug use and sexuality in the movie, there wasn't too too much but there was enough and I think the movie would have been better without it. The main thing about this movie is it is very gory and not good for kids and if your son/daughter can handle lots of blood and scary monsters, it's fine. If not then do not let them watch this, it is very VERY gory."
2414,8,"-I am not at all a fan of horror movies, but I loved this movie. It's hilarious, interesting, and refreshingly original. I was 16 when I saw this and had no problems with it, but wouldn't recommend it to anyone much younger than that."
2415,8,"-The Cabin in the Woods definitely has a witty screenplay and is a smart horror comedy. It features excellent direction and some decent acting. Very original and unique but pause for kids fifteen and under. The film has some sexual content/nudity, heavy language, some smoking and drug use from a certain character, and a large amount of violence. A-."
2416,8,"-this movie scares me to death. i don't wanna watch it!not only that it is really scary,but,it has innapropriate language!and i don't like it!and there's drugs in it! and i heard that drugs will make you really sick!i hate this movie! i wish movies like this were never invented!"
2417,8,"-My rating:PG-13 for mature content, and language."
2418,7,"-I like a lot of Studio Ghibli movies, but OMG, this is the best! The animation is so cute, and like everyone else, I fell in love with Baron Humbert von Gikkingen. He's so dashing and handsome. It's  a short but sweet film, and one of my top recommendations!"
2419,7,-OMG best Ghibli film ever!!!  I loved all the characters and everything was adorable. To be honest I fell in love with the baron. In my opinion best anime film ever!!!!
2420,7,"-This film was was extremely easy to watch and follow, with the storyline being typical of a normal movie. I do just think that this is just a nice kid’s/family movie that you won’t have any problems with. The Baron to me is a bit like Sherlock Holmes with his British accent and mannerisms, the only thing I was a bit disappointed about was that the plot from ‘Whisper of the Heart’(the movie that ‘The Cat Returns’ is a spin-off of) isn’t picked up, with his missing girlfriend, which is a shame. But, if you haven’t watched the previous film then you don’t need to worry about that, also you don’t need to have watched ‘Whisper of the Heart’ to watch this film, there isn’t all that much that connects them. I liked the protagonist, Haru, she did have her assertive moments, but then there were also moments where I felt like she was the damsel in distress, which I thought went a bit against her character.  This movie is suitable for everyone, it has nothing upsetting or inappropriate in it and I could imagine myself liking it from as young as when I was in nursery. Overall, this is just a heart-warming movie, that to me is nothing all that original or different(hence the three star rating), but would definitely be a nice one for kids or families to watch as a short fun film."
2421,7,"-The Cat Returns is a very interesting movie.The cats, in my opinion, are a little creepy but later in the movie I got used to them.It has romance in it  which I didn’t like.Some cats get thrown out windows which is a little scary.One of the main characters almost died and that also scared me.But overall the movie is really funny and a good family movie."
2422,7,"-The “Cat Returns” deserves five stars for it’s quirky characters, cute cats and it’s theme. The main theme was definitely hidden, and I found it. I noticed the characters seem to depend on if someone is “cool” or not. Haru, the main character, starts the movie with being late and gets in trouble. She is walking home from school and sees a cat in the street and a big truck is going towards the cat and Haru saves him with her lacrosse stick. Will Haru regret this decision when she finds out who she saved? Will she regret listening to the whisper from above? And will she regret Calling another cat, Moota, fat?"
2423,7,"-This is another lovely masterpiece from Ghibli! This visually pleasing story about a girl who is swept away to the kingdom of cats after rescuing their prince is a hilarious, adorable film that I would definitely recommend.  Although there is a slight amount of adult humor that will go over kids heads, it is one of the cutest and most memorable films of the genre. 10+ is quite extreme."
2424,7,"-While ""The Cat Returns"" is Studio Ghibli's shortest feature film to date (11 mins shorter than ""My Neighbor Totoro""), it's worth a watch if you like humour, excitement and talking cats. ADVISORY: Not much scariness or violence; two cats have a short sword duel with no notable injuries, the lower half of a tower is blown but the upper half doesn't collapse and no-one on top or ground is hurt, two cats are thrown out of a window but they are not seen getting hurt. Little to no swearing; a character confesses she has a crush and the main storyline is about the main character being forced to marry a cat, but there is absolutely no sex in the movie; cats are seen drinking something in a feast but it's not stated to be alcohol. The main positive message is about believing in yourself and accepting yourself as who you are. REVIEW: This lesser known Studio Ghibli film surprised me positively with its lightness, humour and simple but beautiful animation style. The characters are well done, from Haru's insecure awkwardness to the Baron's gentleman calmness and Muta's flippant streetman's speech.  While ""The Cat Returns"" lacks the high stakes, breathtaking art and long running time of other Ghibli films, sometimes it's just relaxing to forget the world around you for little over an hour and dive into the magical nonsense of the Kingdom of Cats."
2425,7,"-This film's style is ridiculous and hilarious. It is about a teenage girl named Haru who saves a cat who then talked to her.  She is then introduced by a bunch of talking cats to the Cat Kingdom. Along the way, she meets a living crow statue and living humanoid cat mannequin. The movie is laugh-out-loud hilarious throughout. I could probably watch it again and again. It's hilarious because of the ridiculousness of the situations, from talking cats showering Haru with gifts that only cats like and wanting Haru to marry the cat prince just for saving one of their cats, and the dialogue that the cats engage in with Haru and each other. It's like My Neighbor Totoro with a lot of unintentional humor of the so-bad-it's-good type, but it also has lots of intentional humor which is all good as well. The way they did the English dub wasn't half bad. It actually sounded like the way people would speak in English. The visual style was good, too, looking colorful, the outlines being thin, and the characters looking almost realistic. The story's plot wasn't too complex, but it was still good. I was able to identify a clear three-act structure, but it was fast paced and always funny. The characters are good. There's the grumpy fat cat, Muta, the out-of-his-mind Cat King, the fish out of water, Haru, and many others. The story is good, but the real standout is the humor. You have to see this movie to believe how good it is. One last thing: Why is this movie called The Cat Returns? When was the first time the cat came? But that's just the title, not the movie itself. Why did Common Sense give this movie a 10+ rating? It's perfectly fine for kids."
2426,7,-The cat returns is a fantasy adventure film in the classic studio ghibli mold. It has great characters and has a positive message about believing in yourself and helping others. There is some fantasy violence and mild peril but nothing too scary. If you like cats you’ll love this film!
2427,7,"-The Cat Returns is a heartwarming, epic adventure. There is a little bit of fighting, a few cats are thrown out a window, and muta  is shown stuck in a big bowl of catnip jelly. Haru talks about a crush on a boy and falls in love with Baron. Language is not a problem, just some words like idiot and fatso."
2428,6,-This is a really good movie. It could be scary for younger audiences but it tells a great story with a lot of adventure!
2429,6,"-Not very memorable film with somewhat unlikeable characters,rushed plot,and unfunny humor,but at least the anmation and voice acting save the day here."
2430,6,"-there isn't anything wrong except when grug tells  the story and at the end when he says ""DIEEEEEEEEEE"" that's kind of dark but other than that its good"
2431,6,-Great movie why is everyone saying it's violent it really isn't it is pg 13 for a reason great movie I loved it when I was younger
2432,6,"-Isn’t too much violence. Just a little here and there, like a couple Tiger bites. No cussing, or sex. "
2433,6,"-If you are working, put this movie on the TV for your kids!They will not disturb you!! "
2434,6,"-THE CROODS holds strong messages about family, but parents may need to know that there are some scenes that may scare young children."
2435,6,-It’s my favorite movie in the whole entire universe. I love it the most. I think it’s funny.
2436,8,-This movie is about fashion so kids may get bored in this movie. It doesn't Target audiences much but still a nice movie and the soundtrack is good.
2437,8,"-I loved this movie! It's absolutely original, and everyone casted was the best. If you don't appreciate or perhaps understand fashion, you might find it boring. There's a lot of clothing transformations and it's all really nice for me. "
2438,8,"-Fashion, friends, job, and s*x. Fun movie to watch with the family or a group of friends. Some cursing, but nothing too serious. Occasional s*x, but only women in lingerie and topless men. All the characters are likeable and hilarious."
2439,8,-This is a very good movie and I understand why it is pg-13. There is some pretty strong language but no f bombs that I can remember. They character emily seems to have an eating disorder/body image issues. All of the people who work at runway have issues with body image and ridicule andy (who is actually very healthy and beautiful) for being a size 6. You should tell your kids that this is wrong. some sex also but no nudity. a few drinking scenes
2440,8,"-Directed by David Frankel, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a great story about finding who you really are. Starring Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway, it combines comedy and drama into a meaningful film. What if a woman fresh out of college gets a job working for a highly successful fashion company? Andy is fresh out of college and really wants to be a journalist in New York. She applies for a job for the fashion magazine, Runway, and under famous Miranda, the chief editor of Runway. She miraculously gets the job despite her terrible fashion sense. Over time she gets busier and gradually makes her way up the ranks as an employee and as an assistant to Miranda."
2441,8,"-It is SUCH a great movie! Yes, it does have some cursing and s-x, but other than that it is SO good. Provides a great message: choose kind and nice over skinny and glamorous, and don’t let people treat you like crap."
2442,8,-Violence
2443,4,-DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS MOVIE. This movie was very cringy and wasn't good quality. Very childish and not something teens or adults would find interesting. Just a very dumb movie.
2444,4,-its awesome but not better then cotton candy
2445,4,-i like it very much this movie are for all people....
2446,4,-not so great
2447,4,-this movie show that face your fears or you'll never get to where you want to be in the future this show a life lesson 
2448,4,-The kids loved it
2449,8,"-At first, I really despised the ending. The ending showed how if you have perserverance, you can crush other people's dreams. I didn't like that because I thought they were celebrating it. But if you look at it like a cautionary tale, it's a mighty fun ride."
2450,8,"-I personally really liked this movie although it had words like F.. K,S.. T and ass it had a strong message of persevere  and love"
2451,8,"-The movie, The Founder, is a very well made film about the coming of McDonald's. It is not the most charming story, as the main character steals ideas and breaks contracts to get ahead and beat other people. Although it displays a message that you can do anything you can dream of, at any age."
2452,8,"-Howit starts put as ray just selling his invention, to him becoming more of a villian in the movie. He divorces his wife, and puts the original mcdonalda out of business. Definitely puts a different eye on ""why not to go to mc donalds"" ontop of that its fake and unhealthy foods."
2453,8,"-I really enjoyed this movie. Though somewhat selfish and not a great role model, Ray Kroc does show tremendous work ethic and perseverance, and keeps fighting for his vision until it is realized. Overall, the movie highlights the importance of hard work and never giving up. "
2454,8,"-The reviews call it an ad for McDonalds, not at all! This movie shows the story of the ""founder"" of McDonalds, a sleazy dirtbag who stole the company from the real founders and screwed them over in the process. [SPOILERS] "
2455,8,-This is a real story about a guy that owns McDonald's
2456,7,-Young dino braves nature in lovely but intense adventure.
2457,7,"-I loved this movie when it first came out and i love it now! Though i don't remember it being so sad, this movie is great though. I believe it teachers and shows that you can get through and achieve anything, even if your lost or scared."
2458,7,-Admiring dino learns positive messages.
2459,7,"-BOO! It was very boring, dark, and depressing, nothing like the original Pixar movies. Arlo is a Wimp, whining and asking his parents permission for every little thing. Spot can't Hulk out. Thunderclap is the worst villain ever. And the only thing that he loved was himself, so throwing Arlo's dad off a cliff to a river would do nothing. This scene is stolen from Mufasa's death. You do not throw some one you truly love, off a cliff! It was and remains to this very day, the worst movie I have ever seen. The only good part, was the end!"
2460,7,"-Scared the snot out of me when I was little, I would leave the room during the pterodactyls part. Scared me so bad. I literally would start crying when one of my family members put on this  movie."
2461,7,-It feels like getting trapped in a weird deja-vu nightmare. 
2462,7,"-I've never watched this movie but this is my least favorite Pixar movie! It is boring, childish, emotional and a waste of time! Maybe little kids are probably like it and teens are probably get bored. Okay, the scene of Arlo's dad dying stolen from Mufasa's death in The Lion King! The plot which is not good at all! The pterodactyl (IDR what is name was) is a weakest Pixar villain ever! And Arlo is quite not a good role model. He's probably arrogant and annoying as possible. He was in the second place for the least good Pixar hero (first being Merida). I only like is the animation because it's beautiful, releastic, and it's quite top-notch but this movie is trash! And Spot which is a likable character. I really painful to look at is Arlo and Spot getting drunk. It's so weird! I only watched this scene. When I was 9 saw the good Dinosaur for the first time (merchandises and commercial), I quite don't like it because it's boring. Don't watch this movie because it is a waste of time and this Pixar movie is so unlikeable! If you liked The Good Dinosaur, your opinion will be respect so I understand. Edit: For response to my supporter, Dogcat. Thank you! I really appreciate that you reviewed WALL-E But you've never watched this. You saw this movie a little bit in elementary school but not remembered anything that much. I remembered this movie when I was a toddler seeing an advertisement in the theater but I thought it was childish. At 9, I only watched this scene of WALL-E and EVE dancing in space. I thought EVE is a boy and a best friend and I don't know what her name is. I mistaken that! EVE is WALL-E's girlfriend! Now (since 13), I love it! Not childish anymore! It's awesome family film! WALL-E is one of my favorite Pixar movies ever and I'm a fan! I know all of the scenes! I think you've never watched all of Pixar movies except Finding Dory, Cars 3, and Inside Out. I think these movies you've never watched Up, WALL-E (like you said before), Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc and amp; Monsters University, Toy Story movies, A Bug's Life, Coco, The Incredibles (Nadia Cloud's favorite Pixar movie), Ratatouille, Brave, Cars 1 and 2, and Soul. I would like to let me know if you watched or never watched these Pixar movies! And have seen these movies before but never watched these. Thank you! See ya! ;)"
2463,7,"-a lot of you said this movie was sad or scary, but I was 8 when I saw this and I was so bored. I knew what death is and all that, but I was so bored I couldn’t focus on the “violent” parts or the story. Now that I’m 13, (contrary to what the bottom of my review might say) I might rewatch this movie and possibly be able to focus on the story. If you or your kid, friend, parent, or whoever wanted to see this film out of curiosity in terms of the trailer, I would not reccomend watching this. This is kind of off-topic but I had the same reaction to big hero 6, but I was 6 at the time and like I said, my reaction was same, but I whined and complained things like “waa” and “mommy, I’m not having fun” ( I didn’t know boredom is a word) And that movie might be better if there was a better explanation on what was going on to the kids. (btw I did not understand what death is at age 6)"
2464,7,"-I saw this when I was seven. I adored dinosaurs so I was like, “Oh my goodness, a dinosaur movie that’s animated! I need to see this!” So when we went on a holiday to Perth to see some of my family, I thought that would be a perfect time (it was still in cinemas)! So we booked in a time and then we arrived. Long story short, I was slightly sick at the time so a lot more emotional. I pretty much never cry at movies (and I didn’t usually, even way back then,) so yes you know where this is going,, I CRYED THROUGH THE LITERAL WHOLE ENTIRE MOVIE! LITERALLY EVERY SCENE WAS DARK AND DEPRESSING AND IT DIDNT EVEN HAVE A HAPPY ENDING. "
2465,7,-Well all and all this is a great movie to watch with your family.  There are a couple scenes that are sad like a scene where he loses his dad in a flood. And in one scene a character rips a cute bugs head off. soo l would make this a pretty good movie.
2466,6,-I personally love this movie. Its one of the first 80s movies I saw and its very funny and the characters grow on you.
2467,6,-This movie is a bit scary but not terryifiying my 6 your old brother was a bit scared but liked it I rate this movie 7+
2468,6,-Great movie ok for tweens though there is a lot of bad language but it is funny but also is action becuase a boy is on a hunt for one eyed willies treasure a few scares though there are some good messages and is a fun family movie
2469,6,"-This film is a must see 80s classic, the humour, the thrills, the iconic quotes,  this film has it all, made mostly for kids though there is some language and scary scenes."
2470,6,"-I wanted this film when I was 11 and I was in Secondary school. I already know every word that they said and I understood everything. A character does pretend to hang himself in the beginning but nothing really happened. One of the main characters does trick a lady who isn't English, that the family keep drugs and she will be locked up with cockroaches with no food or water but nothing happens.And there is a bit of swearing and a statues penis gets broken and they try to glue it back on.But the film shows friendship and loyalty to each other. It shows you can't get by in life if you don't have people looking out for you. Even if they annoy you all the time."
2471,6,"-Great movie with great messages and role models! I bit of swearing, some kissing and one scene with a naked statue, the criminals smoke a little and scary at some times."
2472,6,"-its ok, "
2473,6,-halarius and some language
2474,6,"-I watched this movie when I was about 8. I was an absolute wuss, so Sloth is the only thing that scared me. Obviously it was made in the 80s so it should be rated PG-13 because of swearing and sexual references. I don’t think the swearing or innuendos are a problem because if they are young it will go over their heads, and if they are older they are probably hearing it anyway. In the beginning there is a faked hanging, and later a dead body and skeletons. Nothing really that I would say is supper worrisome. "
2475,6,"-This movie is so good but it has bad words like ""s--t and""bulls--t"" and Andy kisses Brand :("
2476,7,-This Movie had talk of drugs in the beginning but also had swearing. I liked this Movie because it was funny to watch in 2018. The only complaint I have is you can't understand one of the kids. The kids name is Data.
2477,7,"-It's an 80's movie, and rating systems were different back then. Kids do inappropriate things and has mature themes. I like the adventure and the story,  I just believe it's more for older audiences."
2478,7,"-This movie is awesome. I saw this movie when I was seven and my older sister was eight. I remember at the end of the movie her saying it was scary, and yes it can be. If kids have a fear of strangers chasing them, they might want to wait until they get older. Also, there are a lot of scaring words so if you have an eleven-year-old that is very immature, wait until he/she is older and knows not to repeat them, but there are no really bad words. There are a few kisses and scary scenes, too. Recommended for mature tweens."
2479,7,"-I haven't seen this movie in a few years, but when I was 6 years old all I remembered was that I was so obsessed with The Goonies after I watched it. Some reviews state that situations are inappropriate, but from what I recall, this was a brilliant adventure made for kids. Go watch this classic!"
2480,7,-I watched this when I was 6 didn't understand some stuff
2481,7,"-A great movie to watch with the whole  family! (Beware,  some language)  All the main character are fighting for the right to keep there homes"
2482,7,-The Goonies was OK but there is swearing.  Words used include shi* and dam*. There was a lot of editing mistakes I noticed as well. Also there were a few sexual scenes
2483,7,"-Curious to see the reviews on this movie, I read a couple of them. I think the parents are overreacting.  My mom bought this movie for us and we all had some good laughs! They say sh*t 19 times, but that's what every kid will here in the real world, do don't make them live under a rock! My mom was very glad she bought this movie because not many kids movies make me laugh! This would probably be a PG-13 movie nowadays, but nonetheless a great, funny, movie the whole family can enjoy! Many kids in my class love this movie! For little kids most of the sex jokes and bad words just fly right over their heads, usually it's not clear what they mean and could be easily interpreted as something else that is not bad. Enjoy watching!"
2484,7,-it's a good movie
2485,8,-My rating PG-13: some intense violence.
2486,7,-!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2487,7,"-I was OBSESSED with this movie! It has quite a bit of violence, but it's not horrible. There is not that much swearing. The reason why I give 10 and up, is because there's nothing horrible in this movie. If you like the series divergent, you would like this movie A LOT!"
2488,7,"-The movie tells the story of Katniss Everdeen in a competition with 24 other contestants, and only 1 can live. There is not much blood, but some scenes are very violent, and somewhat suspenseful. Katniss is a strong role model, too."
2489,7,"-Parents: Katniss is one of the best role models I have ever seen.  The movie is pretty violent though, it is not afraid to show some blood. Critical: This film is a thought provoking adventure about a future world which celebrates a battle to the death disguised as a reality show, known only as the Hunger Games. The second hour is very intense, (THIS PART WAS RETARDED) My only complaint is that it is too long before the titular conflict starts. Overall 4.6/5"
2490,7,-This is REALLY violent!! You better read the book or see the 2nd movie! You see a LOT of blood and its more for like a 11 year old or a MATURE 10 YEAR OLD!! if you really LOVE your  9 year old & up kids dont watch this! Its VERY scary but the Second movie is good! 10 up can see catching fire! :D :D
2491,7,"-I liked it when I watched it then I went to go see catching fire and now I hate this film along with Catching fire. The dumbest movies I have ever witnessed. Too violent, sad and WAY too intense. But is there anything good about this movie? Well I like the soundtrack and I can tell that it was very well edited and they did a great job on it. I just don't like it."
2492,7,-It's a great book full of emotions and struggles. I wouldn't recommend this for younger kids since it's got mature themes.
2493,7,"-There is a lot of violence. This is something to look into because the movie is really all about an event that is all out violence. There is some swearing and not too much but a bit of sexual content. There is also drinking. So before letting a 10-year-old see this movie, see what they can and can't handle."
2494,7,"-The movie was as good as the book, and almost have the same scenes as the book. You should really watch the movie first, then read the book, because when i try reading the book at age 10, it was kind of hard to understand, so i decided to wait for the movie to come out and see what happens. I understand way better after seeing the movie, so i read the book, and now i understand everything! But, readers, i don't recommend this movie to anyone under 15, because of the violence and the gore!"
2495,7,"-The movie is fine, except at the beginning its really boring. There is some violence, I don't really remember most of it, but it wasn't too bad. Oh ya, at one part the creepy dogs were scary. I think most kids would be ok with it if they can skip the kissing! There is some kissing. I didn't have nightmares or anything from the movie. It's no worse than Iron Man and those movies. Almost the same for violence and action. I guess you just have to know if your kid would be ok with it. My mom and dad knew I would be ok."
2496,7,"-Yes, I consider this a superhero movie, because IRON MAN 3, a big name Marvel movie STEALS the plot point.  Look at how much that made, and you'll know what I'm talking about.  It has some adult stuff in it, but it will probably fly over the kids heads.  Also, your kid WILL BE addicted to superheros after this, GUARANTEE!"
2497,7,-a really good cartoon
2498,7,-Cool
2499,7,-really good! some sex and violence but this is one of not Pixar's not little kids movies!
2500,7,"-The Incredibles is definitely worth your time. The plot and storyline is good, the CGI is wonderful and the movie itself is, just, EPIC! If you're a fan of action packed films or CGI you'll probably love this!"
2501,7,-its good
2502,7,"-Yep, it's ""incredible"" alright. I love this film. Great CGI, perfect acting, amazing writing, and the plot is super creative and just VERY well-exucted (sorry if I spelt that wrong)."
2503,7,-My favorite movie as a kid! still to this day a huge superhero fan! I have to warn u the robot will scare young kids. scared me but that didnt stop me from watching it.  my only problem is the powers werent creative. they are the same as fantastic 4s
2504,7,-perfect
2505,7,-Seriously CSM my 2yr old cousin watches this like every day and he loves it. Also what the hell is inappropriate about laxitives all it does is give you diarrhea and help with diets. What I'm saying is that this movie is so great and appropriate that even the youngest children will probably love this.
2506,7,-Good and funny movie with happy and sad bits.  Nice style of cartoons.  Happy ending.
2507,7,"-This movie is an absolute masterpiece. But it is quite dark, but that's just one of the things that make it so good. It definitely stays true to it's 1957 setting, but it might not be appropriate for younger kids. The main protagonist is a 9 year old boy named Hogarth Hughes, who befriends a giant robot from outer space. Although the robot is friendly, the main antagonist, a U.S. government official named Kent Mansley is paranoid of him, possibly due to the Cold War. There is a scene where Hogarth secretly slips chocolate-flavored laxatives into Mansley's smoothie (I think this was to ditch him.). There is also another scene where a deer is shot, and even a scene where Mansley uses Chloroform in Hogarth. The film also uses words like ""Hell"" and ""Damn"". However, there are also positive messages. For example, Hogarth tells the Iron Giant things like ""Killing is Bad"", ""Guns Kill"", ""You are who you choose to be"", and ""Souls don't die"". At the end, Mansley's paranoia causes him to launch a missile that he later finds out spells certain doom on the whole town. As the town looks up in the sky, knowing they are just mere minutes from death, the Iron Giant decides to sacrifice himself by flying into the missile before it's even close to the ground in a very emotional scene, saving the town. 6 months later, the Iron Giant is revealed to be starting to be self-rebuilt, right before the movie cuts to black. It's an amazing film, but might not be suitable for little kids. It's also a perfect illustration of 1957 USA."
2508,7,"-A boy finds this creature from outer space, teaches it about the world, tries but fails to convince anyone about his discovery and later the government attempts to hunt down the creature. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial right? Yes, and no. Though very similar and a lot less content worries, The Iron Giant, set in the 1950s when the Russians had just deployed the Sputnik into space, distinguishes itself from E.T. by one, 100 ft. metal man."
2509,7,"-Huh. I seem to have a very long pattern of liking cartoons on the front where the animation can seemingly cover up the plot holes, bad voice acting, generic storyline e.t.c. When you start to put aside the animation and put a supreme focus on pure quality, you may re-look at you're favorite movies and go ""Wow. This has gotten a LOT worse. I mean, a LOT worse."" This seems to be somewhat of a normality among today's audiences, and this is 2015, so maybe, as much as everyone loves it, they will re-look at Inside Out and say.. Okay, maybe that's a bit too much. There are some cartoons however, that are so dated, that it's much, much easier to look at the very apparent flaws in the movie, and not love it in the first place. At this point, this is where The Iron Giant is doomed. Sure, it may have lasted a little, to make enough money for the Warner Bros to continue and such, whereas even the current movies will be looked down at eventually, but old movies, such as Citizen Kane, have so much to fall back on, even if it is outdated; the smart acting, stellar storyline, fantastic directing, I could go on forever. These aren't the movies that become outdated, but The Iron Giant really doesn't have that to fall back on. The characters are rather traditional, and really pushes it to see how moral they can go before it becomes something of a school project to induce good morals, which isn't a good thing, in movies where the adults have been over that, and want to see quality. So youngsters may enjoy it, and that alone would be a fair reason to go out and see it, but there are even more primary flaws to come: The voice acting is also the cheesy moral thing, and the animation is very choppy, not detailed, and supremely 2Dish. The storyline also, doesn't do anything creative. It's a lot easier to look over the flaws of a movie if the cartoon aspect doesn't affect you, so maybe I should start re-watching as well. But although not too quality, the young children, maybe five or six, adding to the fact that only a bit of peril will not bother them, might not be as affected by the issues that make this movie as problematic as it is. It'll, actually, be one of their favorites, if the parents are open to a bit of peril and not-at-all-bad-violence, which they probably will be. -Movies0000"
2510,7,"-It was a lot different from the usual movies, either princesses or super heroes, always are the majority of the viewers. This movie was a very interesting one, and teaches good lessons to children."
2511,7,"-I think it's a really sweet, touching story that the whole family will enjoy, and it is very funny in some parts. I definitely recommend it. It's awesome!"
2512,7,"-this is a very good movie, but the end is sad and used to make me cry when i was little."
2513,7,-I am 7 years old and I really really did not I repeat did not like it at all.  beucause I think that it was incredibly sad a specially beucause of the end and the scene with the deer.
2514,8,"-This film nails it right on the head as far as quality goes, and even though its not a musical, they do homage to a few of the songs (e.g. Bare neccities, I wanna be like you, Trust in me).  Unlike the animated classic, it is more entertaining, and has more of a plot. And the CGI is beautiful as well. Share Khan was AWESOME!! Oh and he was quite intimidating as well, and kills at least one character. Kaa is kind of creepy, but her scene was awesome, no Winne-The-Pooh voice, instead Scarlett Johansten. Overall very fun film!"
2515,8,"-The actor who played Mowgli is so talented, and telling from the fact that he was the only human actor shown on screen he did absolutely amazing. The special effects are terrific to... You can barely tell on most animals that they are not real! In some scenes, it is very quiet but then something very surprising happens which can make you jump. That's why I think that kids 9 and up would enjoy it better, since they are used to movies that may be a little more intense."
2516,8,"-The Jungle Book is about how Mowgli (Neel Sethi) has to find his way back to the man village as a fearsome tiger named Shere Khan (Idris Elba) is on the hunt for him. The Jungle Book is a film that I feel is  too charming and joyful to not like. There are some moments where i was on the edge of my seat or biting my nails or jumping when Shere Khan is on screen popping up everywhere. The voice talents are amazing, my personal favorite being Idris Elba as Shere Khan."
2517,8,"-I recently watched this at the theaters on a special outing with my grandparents. Though it is targeted toward a younger audience, I thought it was a excellent movie for any age, full of excitement, fun, and a lesson on learning to be who you are. Stand-alone actor Neel Sethi (the young lead protagonist) took it all on himself and surprisingly did a amazing job. I say at least four stars."
2518,8,"-You can really tell that it's just a kid in a green room the whole time because the acting is really weak. None of the reactions from Mowgli feel genuine, and why would they? Special effects are stunning of course. Bill Murray was Bill Murray, and Christopher Walken was great as the enormous fleshy orangutan king."
2519,8,"-This movie is really fun and the graphics are really cool.  The panther, bear, and wolves looked so cuddly. :-)  There is no language that I remember hearing.  There are a few parts that are scary when the giant monkey chases him and captures him and when Sheer Khan the tiger is chasing him and threatening to kill him.  It would scare a younger audience but when I went there with my 11 year old friend she loved it.  I did not like the monkey because his singing was really annoying.  There are two songs in the movie.  The monkey sings a song and then Bear Necessities is sang.  There is a lot of clean humor that much younger kids would not understand but I thought it was funny.  There are a few parts that are intense and make you jump but all in all it was a great movie."
2520,8,"-A word of advice if you're seeing this film - don't be holding anything that could spill. You will jump out of your seat. I promise. The movie isn't all that bad, though. It had some gorgeous animation and a really sweet story. "
2521,8,"-I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with this one. The trailer looked gorgeous, but of course there's always the chance that the movie doesn't live up to the advertisement-- I couldn't be more wrong. The very first scene begins with a chase/training of some sort, and it immediately captured my attention. I didn't particularly love the young actor who portrayed Mowgli at first, but he eventually began to grow on me. The cinematography is beautiful, the animals are realistic, the battles scenes between the animals keep you wonderfully sitting on the edge of your seat. Even if you aren't familiar with the story of The Jungle Book classic, you can still enjoy this film. There's quite a bit of violence throughout the film (such as the animals attacking each other) but I wouldn't consider it an unnecessary to the movie. It's a film both children and adults will love, and the high ratings that it's received is by no means an overstatement. I would encourage you to go see it -- It's probably the best film I've seen this year."
2522,8,"-Parents should be aware that this version of The Jungle Book is darker, more intense, and scarier than the original 1967 picture. It is an amazing visual experience, the CGI is incredibly realistic and the green screen is flawless. This enhances the viewing, but also makes the fight scenes scarier. A very minor amount of blood can be seen (just a few cuts and bruises), and the fight between animals feature loud sound effects, clawing, biting, but no blood. One death will hit hard, as it happens very quickly and has a jump scare. Speaking of jump scares, there are three or four of them in The Jungle Book. Children under 8 won't be able to handle them. The film has some serious, gritty moments, but also some very fun and joyful moments (songs, jokes, etc.). It is an amazing experience, with Oscar worthy visual effects, stellar voice acting (Ben Kingsley, Scarlett Johanson, Idris Elba), and humour. Children under 8 may need to cover their eyes for 1 or 2 scenes, but not often."
2523,8,"-Modarate,Violence,scary scenes,peril,upsetting scenes. Very mild language. However the film is about friends and teamwork but the are explained through emotional moments."
2524,8,"-I think that most kids can definitely watch this, although younger kids might find it boring. It does have some fight scenes so if your child is sensitive to violence this may not be a good pick. It really just depends on your child. (I think its a great movie)"
2525,8,-i think this is awesome!
2526,8,"-Great movie with lots of positive messages. The violence in this movie is not too much for kids to tolerate. Daniel is a great role mode, though this movie has some faults. Like the movie writer seems to think that girls are weak and can't defend themselves. One example of this is when Mr. Miygi said to Daniel that he was ""Punching like a girl."" Over all a great movie that has some flaws"
2527,8,-Mr Myagi teaches Daniel Kung Fu so he can defend himself the next time he gets bullied at school. Then Daniel goes to a karate competition and gets hurt really badly in the knee but gets back up. Then in the final round Daniel goes up against the one who shows no mercy for Daniel. His name is Johnny. Daniel does what Mr Myagi taught him and wins.
2528,8,"-The Karate Kid is an amazing movie that the whole family ( from little kids to grandparents ) can enjoy. The violence is little and is used in the Karate scenes and one bullying scene in which you see a little blood. Swearing is also little with only a few bad words such as ""damn"" and ""basterd"". The racist term ""slope"" is also used. One of our villains Johnny is rolling a joint in one scene but that will fly right over kids heads. There is nothing sexual in the film except for a lengthy kiss. The message in this film is also great and Mr Miyagi is a huge role model."
2529,8,"-Ok soooo the actual movie is rated 15 (England) because of drugs and violence, some sexual stuff but highschool era "
2530,8,"-A classic movie that is appropriate  for kids! This website tends to stretch its reviews so basically most kids can hardly watch anything. I that the goal?? anyway, I think this movie is awesome and any kid can see it, maybe not really little kids, but otherwise everybody."
2531,8,"-I think this is a great movie. But it is still best for older kids. The violence is generally mild, but there are bruises on faces, a small amount of suggestive themes, as well as some use of mild language and less inappropriate insults such as ""bulls--t,"" the GD word, the D word, ""frigging,"" and ""bast--d."" But one thing parents and kids can talk about is not everything is the way it seems. Anyway, this is a great movie that I would highly recommend for martial arts fans."
2532,8,"-This film has heart-warming moments as the main character, Daniel, bonds with an unlikely friend and mentor, mr Miyagi. Mr Miyagi works as a janitor, but he can pull a punch. Having found out that mr Miyagi is a karate master, Daniel requests training after numerous beatings by Johnny, the school bully who has a black belt in karate. Meanwhile he develops a relationship with Johnny's ex-girlfreind, Ali. All in all I think this is a suitable film for most ages and in my view the best movie iv'e ever seen."
2533,6,"-I was watching this movie a little while ago and i said ""i think i might rewind and watch it again""  i think in my life i have watched this movie over 4,000 times it's soooo good.    i would reremend this movie to 5+!!"
2534,6,-Extremely good yet sad and scary for young kids.
2535,6,-this movie was really good in 3D but some parts would be too scary for younger kids.  like near the end there is some fighting which was kind of scary but it was really good.
2536,6,-I think its absurd that any parent would find this movie inappropriate for kids above 4. I watched Lord of The Rings when i was 6 and I wasn't scarred for life. I definitely didnt need therapy!
2537,6,-I think the original Lion King is great!
2538,6,"-The film is good, quite a bit of violence and lots of scary scenes, but note this film was NOT released 2011. It was released far before that. It's only been re-released in cinemas. Please, get your classics right!"
2539,6,"-This is my favorite movie,and I  think it is fairly educational because of the animals and nature,just as long your kids are able to understand it."
2540,6,-I give it a G
2541,6,-I like this movie.
2542,7,"-Y'all really need to lighten up on this movie. Ariel has cleavage, but guess what? It's barely any, it's not explicit, and she's a 16 year old wearing a shell bra. She has a chest. Grow up. She's not really a good role model, given the whole ""you need to be pretty to get the guy"" thing, but this is a classic Disney movie made with the classic Disney formula. Cinderella doesn't get the guy until she transforms, but I don't see anyone talking bad about her. Anyway, the only genuinely iffy thing is basically Ursula's character. She eats live sea creatures in  a scene (keep in mind this is basically cannibalism in this world), Ursula calls Ariel a tramp when she (Ariel) is successfully impressing Eric, and Ursula's death is actually pretty dark for a Disney movie (but nothing your kids probably can't handle). There's also a scene with a shark at the beginning of the movie. Overall, this movie is fine for kids and the parents on this site are honestly ridiculous."
2543,7,-This is a sexy/lovey doub movie involving Areil and 
2544,7,"-The movie that relaunched Disney and started the Disney Renaissance (a period where some of the best Disney films are considered to have been made) is none other than The Little Mermaid, one of the most beloved Disney films made.  The story of a young but rebellious teenage mermaid who strikes a deal with an evil sea witch to...ah, you'll find out.  Just make sure you see this one if you're a Disney fan!"
2545,7,"-This is such a good movie! I'm probably older than I should be to watch Disney princess movies, but nothing will ever beat the Little Mermaid.! I wasn't going to write a review, but some of the ones I saw  from  overly sensitive parents are ridiculous. There is no way that I would ever want to raise my child in a world where The Little Mermaid is "
2546,7,"-one of my favorite Disney movies to date. Great soundtrack, some humor, and great animation, totally worth watching."
2547,7,-I love this movie! From the songs to the loveable characters to the hopeless romantics out there. I adored this movie.
2548,7,-Teaches kids to explore the world and there is a lot out there. But there is some innuendo.
2549,7,"-This is an AWESOME movie!!!!!! Ariel is a positive role model for everyone(even boys). She teaches us to stand up for what we believe in. Eric is a positive role model because (1) He is not full of himself (2) During the fire/birthday scene he shows that he LOVES his dog Max. He went back into the fire and he risked his life, just so he could save Max."
2550,7,"-this disney movie has AWFULL role models and a DISGUSTING message. The movie shows ariel disrespecting her father never listening to him and causing trouble, she changes herself to be with a prince (come on is that really a lesson we want kids to see). and just so you know in the original book where the little mermaid was based on for the movie ariel DIES, so this movie is bad please dont show it to your kids changing your body is not a lesson we want to give them."
2551,7,-very scery ursula is very scery i didin't even finish it
2552,4,"-Honestly, some of you parents need to calm down. Those who say she's not wearing enough clothes, really? She's a mermaid, do you expect her to wear a T shirt? And as for she liked Eric just for his looks 1. She saw he had a passion for music like she did, and 2. When he recieved a statue of himself for his birthday, he made a disgusted face showing he wasn't vain or full of himself. The music is absolutely stunning and in no way sexual like some of you freak parents are saying. One of Disney's best movies that I love, even though I'm almost 13."
2553,4,"-This is one of the fine movies ever. Ariel is good. She reminds me of the time I was swimming during August. Ursula is the witch who has won the lottery. She has Ariel's voice for good, which is bad for infants. Eric is beautiful!! He loves Ariel. Flounder is a comedy fish who teases on Scuttle. Fine movie."
2554,4,"-This film sends out a great message that if you set your mind to something, you will succeed."
2555,4,"-My fav movie of all time. I watch it all the time, and it never gets old. Those kids who think that her outfit has to much cleavage, then u should watch ballroom dancing cause that is too much cleavage, not Ariel's dresses. They are just normal outfits. And this movie is one of the best classics out there. I know her songs by heart and know all the lines. I say this movie should be for all ages, because it has a lesson learn; some risk in life are worth taken that is the real moral and that what the creators of the little mermaid was going for. Unlike mordern Disney movies, The Little Mermaid touches hearts of ppl of all ages. It has that sort of spark to it, please let your kids see the movie. They would love it. I know I did when I first saw it, and I still love it."
2556,4,-The Little Mermaid is like a SAW cartoon.
2557,4,"-I LOVE the Little Mermaid! But when I was reading the reviews, I noticed that some parents find that Ariel's clothing choice isn't good. I mean really? Do you want her to go around in a turtle neck? I think you all are over protective of your kids, they have to grow up sometime. You probably don't even let them watch Elmo. They probably have to watch the movie on ABC's all the time. Come on! This is a great movie! Ariel is a strong young woman, who inspires girls, to do what they believe in. It's either this or what they will find out online. Disney wouldn't make any movies too scary."
2558,4,-why does everyone thinks its inappropiate 17 and older really this movie is for 6 year olds it does not teach girls to show off their bodies she's a mermaid what else is she going to wear a Tshirt this is a good movie for little kids if your daughter watches this its not like they'll what their belly button showing and what to wear tight clothes parents are to picky about what there child watches
2559,4,-this is a great movie for kids but my daughter always want to be like ariel lol.
2560,8,-Classic movie perfect for young boys
2562,8,-Review: The Man from Snowy River 
2563,8,"-I recall watching this with my family multiple times as a child, and loving the idea that this movie presents. There is some swearing, which was a little unnecessary, but I never picked up on it as a kid, and only realized the cussing when I last rewatched it. There are a few kisses (Three, I think), which never bothered me or my family but it may others. A few of the characters get drunk, but are so tipsy that they only made a fool of themselves and the main character (Jim), looks down on them, so it is not seen as a good thing. another character smokes a cigarrete, but the result is having horse dung thrown on his shoe, and is also shown as a bad thing, and Jim tells him something smart about how stupid the choice to smoke was."
2564,8,-One time in the movie a guy calls a nother guy a basterd
2565,8,"-Other reviewers have already given a good overview, but I have a few notes to add."
2566,8,"-This is a FANTASTIC movie to watch as a family, it really shows deeply people need to ""unplug"" from media and is well made. Some of the song choices are... odd and also ONE ANNOYING THING: THE KID'S VOICE SOUNDS LIKE AN ADULT. THIS LITTLE BOY SOUNDS LIKE HE IS 30!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2567,8,"-It uses a basic premise and mixes it with an innovative animation style, a few character dynamics and tropes that aren't seen in cinema often, and a realistic family conflict. "
2568,8,-I lovee this movie. It's very funny. A few tears of laughter may escape you. It is perfect to see with the family
2569,8,"-First off, this movie has great representation of LGBTQ+ people with the main character being hinted as lesbian through the movie finally revealing at the end of the movie! Also Autism representation! The son is likely to be autistic, although it is never actually said,  with extreme obsessions with dinosaurs and misunderstanding social cues. Also, the movie critiques consumerism and capitalism in the digital age through hilarious gags!"
2570,8,"-When I thought about watching this, I was sorta like: OMG, this is going to be 3/5 stars. BUT I was WRONG!! This thrilling animated adventure about a family surviving through the robot appocalypse is a beautiful example of teamwork, sci-fi, and comedy. Buckle your seat belt for hilarious action-sequences and one crazy family as they drive across the country to save the world!"
2571,8,"-The Mitchells vs the Machines was a really amazing animated film. It had great characters and the animation was absolutely refined. Surprisingly, the film was made by the same studio that made The Emoji Movie. I recommend this for ages 10 and up because some scenes can be frightening to some viewers. Just wow!"
2572,8,"-Well, for a movie enthusiast who loves watching all sorts of films would say this TRULY is one best movies I've Seen In Years! The Mitchells vs the Machines is a Great, Funny, Family Film that would be great for all AGES! & I think even as a 14 year old I find this film better than most of the Pixar Movies. It truly is a Must-See Film to Watch. "
2573,7,-I watched this since I was like 5 but it scared me until I was 12. I was seriously horrified and couldn’t watch “this is Halloween” without having nightmares for weeks. Now as a 14 year old I love all the tim burton movies with my whole heart.
2574,7,"-its fine.  I like how its stopmotion and that its directed by henrey selik who also directed Coraline aka the greatest most amazing beautiful emotional fantastic masterpeice which im watching right now.  In other words, go watch Coraline instead."
2575,7,"-The Nightmare before Christmas is such a great Tim Burton movie and for those who says it's “scary”, “inappropriate”, and “creepy”, you're crazy!. Rebecca Spark is Crazybutt! This film has the incredible luxury of being a holiday film that is viewable for TWO different holidays (or year round if you desire). It is shown on TV during October and December (and occasionally November as well). Been heard of Henry Selick directed this movie, he also directed Coraline. I saw it since when I was 7 watching Haunted Mansion holiday and I watched both Henry Selick films. Even I watched Corpse Bride; I drew both Emily and Sally and both are Tim Burton. Holly R have been a fan of watching this movie since she was 5 and it was still newish. It takes a special kind of smaller child to not feel scared of everything in today's world but this has just the right amount of scares and humor. Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King and a ""mascot"" for Halloween who is becoming tired of the same old Halloween stuff every year. He stumbles across the world of Christmas and becomes intrigued by Santa and all the happiness that is in Christmas so he decides that he wants to be Santa. It's a fun, spooky, and jolly holiday movie with a Oogie Boogie Man who isn't really scary because he is just a sack/bag that has eyes and a mouth. He has bugs inside his body. He might scare very sensitive children but if your kids are not sensitive and can handle similar movies like Corpse Bride then by all means this is for them. The stopmotion animation is great, good plot, great music, cool ghoul characters, and some characters are good role models especially Sally. I like when he explains Christmas. My favorite scene is when Fan-favorite Jack disguises as Sandy Claus and pranks all children for presents. It's funny! Though, Disney plus have parental guidance when you played the movie. I have a art teacher who is a fan of Tim Burton. I recommend for ages 7 because of some scenes can be frightening for sensitive younger viewers but older can handle it. Great, Tim Burton!"
2576,7,"-This movie has a great story, and great animation. It has a tad bit of violence but other than that, it is a wonderful film. The characters are great and the story is perfect. This is one of Disney's best films. No language or anything inappropriate. Great film over all!"
2577,7,"-Parents need to know that unlike most Tim Burton films, this movie is for kids. Some stuff that might creep out kids such as ripping off arms, spiders, bats, and monsters. One character opens up his head. Wonderful family movie."
2578,7,"-There is nothing wrong with it, and the claymation is beautiful. the main character does try to steal christmas, but sees the error of his ways.  The people in halloween town are all monsters, but none of them are scary. the main character is a skeleton and he takes off his head once or twice."
2579,7,-Really good movie
2580,7,-This is a great movie but kinda gross. There's a song at the start the shows a load of creepy deformed monsters singing about Halloween. Good movie but 5 and below need to wait one or two years for some of it.
2581,7,"-Good thing it was rated PG.  It was scarier than I thought.  Kids should be 8 to watch it alone, 7 to watch it with an adult.  If kids don't like scary stuff then don't watch this movie."
2582,7,"-This show is possibly the best comedy ever! There is light cursing, (damn, hell, bitch, ass, crap), and there are a few drug references, (Dwight finds a joint in the parking lot, Ryan gets addicted to cocaine, both are played for laughs), lots of sex references and talk of genitals, and finally a small amount of violence. Its all played for laughs, but some younger kids could imitate some of the dumb stuff Michael, Dwight, and Andy do. (Jump off a building into a box, throw scissors at each other, throw watermelon at cars off the top of a building). The show is hilarious, and I would 100% recommend it to anyone!"
2583,7,-often offensive show that holds up in some areas and plunges head first in others. your child has to be mature enough to understand the weight of some of the jokes and has to know that many of the jokes are offensive and that some of the actual beliefs behind the jokes are dangerous to actually believe in.
2584,7,"-The Office is a great show. There are a fair number of inappropriate jokes and references, so if you were going to watch solo I would recommend for 12+. However, if an adult will watch with you, I would okay it for 10-11 year olds as well. My 10 year old sister and I watched it with our mom, and it was fine. However, before letting your 10 year old watch it, you should know that there are several “that’s what she said” jokes, as well as a few about race and sex; there are several references to sex and having sex; one of the characters, Meredith, is an alcoholic; some characters smoke; and there is some language. Anything too inappropriate is bleeped out, but there are damns and dammits, as well as a few other not so nice words. If none of the above is an issue for you, then great, let your kid watch The Office."
2585,7,"-My brother used to watch The office before, after it leaves Netflix USA at the end of the year, and it's available on peacock now. I watched it because it's not that badly after they talk about sex, there's swearing like sort of s**t nor maybe some dirty stuff words, but some F bombs may be use in this show right now. OK for 14 or 15 should be watchin this."
2586,7,"-I love this show, and think that it is totally appropriate to kids 13 and up. But it is a bit awkward to watch with parents."
2587,7,"-Most mature jokes just go over your head. Some episodes are inappropriate with s*x jokes and racy jokes, but overall it's an amazing comedy, romance, and family show!"
2588,7,-I love this show but there are some not safe for work  jokes however Evan though my rating says 12 but it really depends if your child has been through 7th grade health \ education
2589,7,"-This is the absolute funniest show I've ever seen, the characters are relatable yet hilarious, great plotlines for a comedy, lots of  great improvision, starts to decline once sabre purchases Dunder Mifflin, still hilarious, ending was great"
2590,7,-iffy but funny and good
2591,6,"-This was not a good movie. I watched it as a teenager and even found it too creepy, I would think little kids would be terrified. It is very unrealistic, the conductor is mean and irresponsible, and it included many unnecessarily scary sceens (ghost on roof, puppet room, train out of control, lost ticket, even the beginning with the shaking as the train arrives). Our family watched it thinking it would be a cheerful and holiday movie for young children but it was creepy.  Not even the elves were cute! The only thing that was relatively sweet about the movie was the friendship between the three kids and the messages of kindness and friendship. I wasn’t scared but I would imaging young children would be quite scared, it’s not a good movie for little kids. I would recommend that nobody, regardless of age watch the movie!"
2592,6,-This movie is a great movie for all ages it shows all the importance in christmas than  just getting gifts  and santa. Christmas is jesus's birthday and should teach you the importance in family life.
2593,6,"-in the boy's house, there is never light, just dark, and the train is way too loud. Please dude, gimme a better movie"
2594,6,-This film contains positive messages/ role models. THE POLAR EXPRESS is a fun movie for kids aged 6 and up.
2595,6,"-You shouldn't be worried about this AT all, no bad language, no *other* stuff, and any *intended* scariness is just yelling with anger. This was the first movie I watched when I was 2 and I still love it! Great role models and messages of the right thing to do not only for yourself but to help other people too!"
2596,6,"-I love the positive message and the roles that family play in this film.  I loved the characters, and the story about traveling on an express train to the north pole and going through some twist and turns just to be the first kid ever to receive the first gift."
2597,6,-My all time favorite christmas movie!!!
2598,6,-This is the best Christmas movie ever! Me and my family watch this every year. I always feel like I am on Christmas Eve night when I watch this movie and it makes every kid ready for the night before Christmas. It teaches a lesson about how you do not need to see something to believe in it. You should believe in something because you feel it is right. It also teaches the true meaning of Christmas and shows the time spent with family and all the Christmas activities. This is my favorite movie ever! I would recommend this to everyone! Please give yourself a great Christmas treat and go watch it right now!
2599,6,-greatest movie ever! great christmas film for little kids. five stars up but only at christmastime!!!!
2600,7,"-This movie is not remotely bad. The stakes are always high, and Wesley, the protagonist, befriends many previous enemies, including Inigo Montoya, who is out for revenge. His father was killed by a man with six fingers on one hand. He practices a phrase every day. Wesley also befriends Fezzick, a giant man who helps Wesley in every way possible. Princess Buttercup is being forced to marry against her will, so Wesley, Inigo, and Fezzick go on a long quest to rescue her from Prince Humperdink, and the six fingered man. There is no swearing, but there is a small amount of drinking."
2601,7,"-I will say -- I get scared easily by movies. But I think that this movie has too much violence. Bad people put a good man into a torture machine, the princess is planning to commit suicide, a man sticks a knife into another's stomach… This movie gave me nightmares for a while after I saw it.  Not a bad movie, unless you're too young when you watch it, and then it's just awful."
2602,7,"-This movie is one of my favorites! Its not to violent and its great! Barely to little sex, a man makes a comment about a princess's breasts (will go over kids heads) the swearing is very mild! Jesus's name is misused once briefly... Son of a b!tch used once. I would say WITH PARENTS a six year old could watch it. Keep in mind its rated PG"
2603,7,"-Very entertaining and funny. Quite a lot of kissing, though."
2604,7,"-This is one of the best movies of all time!!! Cary Elwes is the BEST in this movie. (Other than men in tights) If anything, I would say it's kind of violent. In the Fire Swamp, the princess' dress gets on fire, but it is quickly put out with nobody injured. In the same scene, Wesley (Cary Elwes) is attacked by an ROUS(Rodent of unusual size) and bit twice, by a giant rat, that might seem a little scarey. Once in the arm, and another time in the shoulder. He screams in pain and eventually sets the rat on fire. It moans, and Wesley stabs it three times to put it out of its misery. Wesley and the princess share quite a few, passionate kisses. A bad guy is poisoned, but it is very silly.  Lots of talk of torture. One reference to the princess' breasts. Iningo Montoya gets stabbed at least three times. Then he stabs his enemy at least three times and kills him. Two torture scenes in the pit of despair. ""Son of a b*tch"" is used once. ""God"" a few times. All of this may sound bad, but it's not. It's also a FANTASTIC  MOVIE!!!"
2605,7,"-Many people have told me that ""The Princess Bride"" was perfect, the best film of all time, and a classic. Did it live up to the hype? For me, it did not. On a technical basis, it could have been improved. One of the biggest problems I had with this film was the pacing. By that I mean how elaborate it was. When Buttercup and Wesley were reunited, we get to see more of their relationship, but that quickly ends and kinds of sabotages the romance which is not good since this is kind of a romance film. The next problem I had with the movie was the consistency of tone. At one point of the movie, it was very kid-friendly, then towards the end, it got bloody. I questioned if I was still watching the same movie and this problem was one of my biggest issues with the movie Hook. I might be coming off as a hater of ""The Princess Bride"", but I assure you I don't hate this movie. I really enjoyed the comedy, the movie had some solid performances and characters, the movie had a cool story of rescuing and the sword-fights were choreographed really well. I'll give ""The Princess Bride"" a 6.5/10. I was underwhelmed by this movie and I was hoping to give the movie an 10/10. This kind of thing happens from time to time. I recommend ""The Princess Bride"" to children mostly."
2606,7,"-This is an unbelievable movie and so good. However, there are two sword fights (one which involves quite a few cuts and stabs), and the eels might scare some young children. Some of the humor is a little adult, and there are a few instances of mild swearing. All-in-all, though, it is an amazing movie that anyone over 8 will absolutely love."
2607,7,"-This was a pretty good movie. It was REALLY funny at some parts. It was strange because some parts felt to fast and others to slow. The romance was nice, but it was definitely fairytale, Not real. I didn't really feel or see any personality in the characters. buttercup was a damsel in distress who sort was just there to be rescued. Westley had personality and I liked him well enough. the three bad guys, two who weren't really bad we're fun. I didn't really see the point in the prince wanting to kill buttercup, I think it was another part of the damsel in distress thing. But I really did like the movie."
2608,7,"-Great film that is a different kind of princess story but still so much fun to watch. Funny and exciting, I recommend this movie to all children 6 and up!"
2609,7,"-""Princess Bride"" was one of those movies I kept hearing about, and it seems you aren't a real movie buff unless you watch it. I can tell it's infinitely quotable to those who grew up watching it, but the enormous rats even scared me, so kids above 10 should have no problem seeing it. Very clever, especially with the hilarious Andre the Giant."
2610,7,"-The Princess Bride is an 80's classic for good reason...it's nearly perfect. Our protagnist is Buttercup a young woman who loves to torment her farm boy Westley...who only replies ""As you wish"" to her every command. Later she realizes he loves her, and she loves him too. When Westley is sent to war and killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts, Buttercup grieves. An evil prince takes advantage of this by choosing her for his bride. However she's kidnapped,and a villain named Vizzini attempts to murder her, but the Dread Pirate Roberts saves her. Buttercup is annoyed, because of what happened to Westley, but why does he seem so familiar?There is lots of sword fighting, and the scene in the fire swamp might be intense for the youngest viewers. A use of son of a b is used, and as Buttercup contemplates suicide Westely mentions her perfect breasts. The comedy in this movie, along with the action, the romance, and the fantays make it a big success. I particulary enjoy Billy Crystal as the wizard, Andre the Giant as Fezzik the giant, and Wallace Shawn as the evil Vizini."
2611,7,"-I thought it wasn't a very good movie but it had a good plot line. Although it would be a great movie for children, there was a couple of moments in the movie where there was some language and really spoiled the movie. Therefore I think that you should not be allowed to watch this if you are 7 or under and should think about the person if they are under 10."
2612,7,-Respect for the classics.
2613,7,-I absolutely loved this movie I recommend for anyone to watch it.
2614,7,"-This is my favorite movie! I love it because there is mostly harmless sword fighting, a giant, R.O.U.S.'s (rodents of unusual size), lots of humorous and quotable one liners."
2615,7,"-I think this movie is very good but in the end there is some blood and violence,and there are some rodents of unusual size wich attack Wesley."
2616,7,-I love this movie and i think it is great for anyone of any age that are not to scared of giant rats.
2617,7,"-As stated at the title. There are a few things I like better about the movie than the book is that you can actually hear what the priest sounds like. Don't mark this as inappropriate but he sounds like he's been kicked in the groan, I don't know what else to call that."
2618,7,-I really like the princess bride. it's fun and adventurous. And I also like Westly and Buttercup.  it's very funny to me.  ALERT:  caution this movie is awesome.  Why I think you should only watch this movie if your 10 or over is because when I watch it I have to skip a few parts because I am not allowed to see them. But one time I saw a few parts that I can not see by accident.
2619,6,"-I personally loved this movie. There are lots of curs words and rude words, but a young child wouldn't understand that. At first i was worried it would be inapropriette but it wasn't.  There is one seen when are stars collide because one is getting out of shower and one in to the shower. Biut i still all around LOVE this movie!!!!"
2620,6,-This hilarious romcom is perfect and funny for teens of all ages!
2621,6,"-The problem with ""The Proposal"" is on its story and plot. It's just plain predictable. You can figure out how the movie is gonna end right in the first minutes."
2622,6,-Haha! I like this comedy movie! This is not for kids.. it shows naked woman and man bumped each other on the side. There are kissing... but very funny!
2623,6,-i watched this and laughed soo hard and just loved the movie the only thing wz i wz watching it with my boy cuzzin who is as old as me and in the scene where they fall accidentally on each other naked was too awkward! but overall a rlly good romance/COMEDY!
2624,6,-The movie is greatandvery interesting. I enjoyed it however the crash though unnessacary showed no sensitive body parts so younger children probably wouldn't even understand it. Overall a brilliant movie.
2625,6,-WOW! This movie is awesome! There is a bit of nudity but nothing sensitive is shown. The woods scene with the grandmother is hilarious and it was super funny. I liked the movie any mature 12 year old would love this movie!
2626,6,-Not for kids!
2627,6,"-This is a great and funny movie. It made me laugh all the way through it, even at sad parts because they made it seem awkwardly funny. It had great characters and a very good story line. Might be inappropriate for some viewers though."
2628,7,-I liked this movie. It's funny and has funny stuff about pets. I liked how the main character had flaws and they all learned stuff.
2629,7,-I was expecting to watch a great movie for kids. What I actually saw was trash. This movie was so boring and the characters were really stupid and annoying.
2630,7,-The movie awesome and most kids (likely elementary & up) should handle it. There are a few dark messages about death and killing.the rabbit character has the personality of murder but it doesn't get to intense. One scary scene most kids may be scared of is when the viper tries to bite Max & Duke.Gidget has a serious crush on max but it isn't sexual.A bird tries to kill Gidget but they becomes friends shortly afterward.overall the movie is good!
2631,7,-The movie has good scenery and animation and teaches kids what others have been through. The story is great itself and has good characters.
2632,7,"-If you have seen the trailer, you've seen everything. The beginning starts of well and interesting, but as it carries on, you sit there feeling like you are wasting your time. So many stupid and unconvincing things occur. Very disappointed, only the beginning is funny. The good bits are all in the trailer..."
2633,7,"-Several bad language uses... for older kids, it is awesome"
2634,7,-This is the best movie e-ver with amazing characters and lots and lots and lots and lots of humor.  This adventure would be best for kids who like animals and adventurous tales.
2635,7,-It's quite entertaining. I loved seeing this movie the first time it was released.
2636,7,-It is awesome especially if you are a pet lover I enjoyed it very much
2637,7,-I heard words like shut up and  loser. The story was just rescue something  .
2638,8,-I watched this when I was 9. It was funny. :)
2639,8,"-I have seen this movie and we have it, but this movie is very inappropriate, lots of sex, language and drinking and smoking. Bart's private area is shown and of course bad language. Bart is the most main offender in this movie. Violence as well, Lisa punches him. The most beautiful I saw in this movie, was the wedding video, there was this once scene that Homer and Marge, (not seen) have a sex reference (not in their bed) being naked, having no clothes on. Otherwise, concerning film."
2640,8,-GREAT MOVIE!! But is inappropriate at most times and it's mostly because of violence and sex.
2641,8,"-Very good, better than the orignial tv show. The only really bad thing is the penis shot- shown for 3 and a half seconds(I tracked) and the rest is fine."
2642,8,"-The Simpsons Movie, as funny as it is, is not for some kids. There is offensive stuff, but make sure your kid can ignore the bad stuff. There is fighting, but no blood beside Itchy and Scratchy (cartoonish). Homer, as normal, loves beer. There are sexual references, and a scene which implies sex. But nothing is graphic. There is language, D***, A**, S***, B*****. There is some gun use. In the end, Homer becomes a hero, after learning to be less selfish, and a better father to Bart."
2643,8,"-homer is a positive role model drinking in a bar...... your kids will look up to him, and bart when he skateboards naked."
2644,8,"-I really like this movie. It's very funny and entertaining. But there are stuff to watch out for. Bart can be seen skateboarding naked, Bart also drinks later in the movie, there is mild use of bad language and there is evidence of violence (as seen during the angry mob scene). It's good but it is more explicit than the cartoon."
2645,8,-:| and :)
2646,8,"-The Simpsons Movie is a pretty awsome film for comical people aged 10 & above. If your child is under that age, some parts are a little unsuitable with some cheeky humour. Is it suitable for kids, mostly yes. But like I said, not all of it is perfectly suitable."
2647,8,-Swears only come every once in a while in the show; but overall it's usually only says B**** but not that often. Anyway it is a suitable show for kids 9 and up.
2648,7,-bad things include
2649,7,"-I think this is the best show anywhere it is very funny. It may make you feel uncomfortable watching with your parents, because of some of the things they say and very rarely show. Other than that I would say it is great for a 10-11 year old. My parents are very strict but they allow me to watch it with my 9 year old brother. I definitely recommend this show no matter what people say."
2650,7,-Older tweens and teens would be fine with the sex references and the language in The Simpsons. My 9 year old sister is fine with it so I would say around 10 and up.
2651,7,-great show for all ages.
2652,7,-I Personally Love This Show And The Rewatch Rate is 110 out of 100 there is lots of drinking BUT it shows you how bad things happen when you drink to much there is cussing but nothing horrible  just the d word the b word (occasionally) and the a word 
2653,7,-This is the best family friendly show ever! There is a bit of sex and stuff but if your kid is mature then most episodes will be fine.
2654,7,-I guess it is entertaining but  who wants to watch yellow people be slobs?
2655,7,-SO FUNNY!
2656,8,"-The Simpsons is a great show!  As soon as my dad showed it to me I thought it was the best show ever.  It's not hard to believe that there are over 30 seasons! It is a little inappropriate at times, but not bad enough to influence kids' behavior. Come on, we're not dumbies."
2657,8,-This isn’t the best show I’ve ever seen but it’s one of them and is definitely the funniest.
2658,8,-Sometimes quite sexual. But most of the time it's fine. Homer gets drunk ALOT and there is also the town drunk too. Homer also strangles Bart frequently
2659,8,-It’s great for families
2660,8,"-I love watching the older seasons of the Simpsons every night with my family. There are mild swear words that 10-12 year olds can definitely handle. They may be some ""kissy kissy"" stuff but its never shown.  The jokes can be dark or mature but most jokes are all so funny!  Good for tweens and older! :)"
2661,8,-Hello simpsons fans and others.
2662,8,-This content GOOD.
2663,8,-The Simpsons has been running for so long and is still going strong.
2664,8,"-The Simpsons is an awesome TV-show to watch, it is age appropriate and it is not like Family Guy. So if your child wants to watch  it. Then that would be a good idea. As long as it doesn't curse a lot in your TV. Have fun watching this show."
2665,8,-i think ages 6.5-13  would start  understanding you see im 8 i understand the jokes.
2666,8,"-I watched this movie alone. I really enjoyed it even if i'm 14. I think this movie is OK to watch with kids, though there are some scary moments and some of them may get scared. It has great messages ."
2667,8,-I watched this movie when I was 7 or 8 and I do not recommend doing so. For what it was rated I think that it definitely should of been at least m (pg-13) great to watch with older kids
2668,8,"-Sword Fights, people getting hit by cars, an evil ogre threatening someone's family, kidnapping, a character gets a bloody injury on their knee which requires medical attention (that they don't have, but it miraculously turns out better). Otherwise, good fantasy movie for 9 and 10 year-olds which positive messages."
2669,8,"-I loved this movie when I watched it as a kid, it has some heavy fantasy themes and some creepy undertones. Some parts of the movie could be distressing for younger viewers ex. Bloody bites and scratches, fighting off comical goblins with knives and tomato soup ect. But most intense things that do happen are kind of ridiculous. Things  do take a dark turn at the end though, with the main character having to make peace with the death of his father by stabbing a monster that has taken on the form of his father in order to make him let his guard down. Overall I think The Spiderwick Chronicles is a great movie for older audiences or more mature kids."
2670,8,-The violence is honestly not a problem. It's all just animated stuff and any kid above 10 can take it. 
2671,8,"-I just went back and watched this movie (I’m 15 now) but back when I first watched it (age 7) it was amazing and introduced me to the Fae and Faeries. I think it’s very cool that there is a movie about the Fae. It even includes tons of facts about them. Now for the kids, as long as your not coddling them then it should be fine"
2672,8,"-Look, first up- the rumor about the dad getting stabbed in the chest was not true, but I won't deny he got stabbed in the hand. Now comes the blood, there was barely any blood in it except wounds similar to the ones that kids get every week by playing outside. Of course, if you plan on letting a kid younger that 9 watch then make sure he'll be able to handle it- there is a a little bit of fear (the goblins are trying to break the circle and the twin is taken away getting pulled by the legs) if you watch the full movie kids will get the idea that it's never too late to make things right (Jared Grace was rude to his mother but in the end apologized). That also when people seem like they are lying they are right so not to judge or jump to conclusions (Jared discovered the world and no one believed him which put his family in potential danger. It also gives the ""trust your gut"" message, because while the decisions he made could have involved pain and scariness and a lot of risk, his gut said he was right- and he was. "
2673,8,-pretty violent. my sister ran out of the house screaming because of the blood and screaming when they got scratched.
2674,8,-There is a giant goblin and he would definitely scare little kids he is in a lot of scenes and they have a big fight and he stabs the goblin.
2675,8,"-I watched this film when it first came out. And what I watched in that hour and a half was kinda disturbing. For starters, in one scene, they imagined ways of their parents dying. They send their parents away, and every time they go somewhere on the map, someone always dies. And they’re always seen kissing with disgusting exaggerated noises playing while their doing it. The neglect they have for their kids is AWFUL! They actually throw one of them into a coal bin. Overall, the film is shocking and appalling"
2676,8,"-I thought this movie was pretty good...until it got cruel. There are cruel parents, the kids try to kill them, and it mentions cannibalism. Tho it’s good...if you aren’t disturbed. (No judgement. I love this movie! Just a but cruel) there also is good stuff! They stick together as siblings there are rainbows, candy, and magic. Tho I forgot to mention it got a bit sexual do to the scenes where the father did this thing with his neck to mother...overall great movie but think about your kids age first. Also you may laugh a dangerous amount! 12+  definitely tho."
2677,8,"-The movie starts of on a bad note with the oldest boy Tim gets put in the hallway when he was a BABY which is so wrong. It has a very up and down middle( Tim has a sister and twin brothers) the kids don’t really get fed unless the steal it, and quite possibly the worst/weirdest part of it all is the way the parents act, they kiss ALL THE TIME and the “dad” (he doesn’t act like a father) does this weird thing where he makes a cat noise to his wife. The best part was the last half hour."
2678,8,"-This movie is good! I can't really say perfect because of some downfalls, but let's talk about the good stuff first! The reason why I placed the age rating as age 8 or older is because my 8-year old sister got to watch this with my older brother, parents and of course me. Why would I be writing this review if I never watched the movie anyways? OK, on to the point. Good stuff, the middle child, Jane, is a kind and amazing girl. Proof: She didn't want to leave the orphan baby that was in a box near the Willoughby house alone. She wanted to find her a home. Next, Tim, the oldest (at least I think it was Tim) has some good values in him. Proof: While with the nanny, Linda, and his siblings, they walked over to the place where Jane left the orphan child. He told the nanny not to ring the doorbell, otherwise she would disturb the man who lives there's work. Next, the four siblings still want to give their horrible parents a second chance, saying that they forgive them, but they literally don't have to love them while they are still their parents, but they freeze at the end. Now let's go to the bad stuff. The kids want their parents to die because they were such bad parents. They imagined them getting eaten by bears, sharks, and burning, too and many more. The parents act so sexual with each other, if I actually said it right. Tim judges the nanny because of reading her messages, thinking that she has something bad to do to them, since she works for their parents. I feel like that's a very bad thing because you can't always judge a person because of this and that. So he makes a thing called a nanny-pult, or a catapult, to literally THROW the nanny out of the window. While the child's parents are gone, they make a mess all around the house. Do we really want our kids doing these things? But behind all these downfalls, there are always some good things. I'm not really sure if that's all, so that's all the information I'm giving to the person who's reading this right now. Funny thing, this actually also makes parents learn a lesson, which is to take care of their children. You don't want them thinking about you as demons and monsters and all of that drama. I think you should watch the movie, if I were to make a choice. If I were a parent, I'd explain to my children that this is just a movie, and that it's all drama and acting, so they don't really have to copy everything a character in it does, especially bad stuff. But if you are a CHILD reading this, take your parent's advice. Easy? That's my advice for you and sorry if I sounded a little harsh at the end. PS: This movie is kinda like Matilda, and if you don't know what that movie is, watch it or look it up on Common Sense Media, again it's like Matilda, but without the principal, which kinda makes it more appropriate."
2679,8,"-This movie was very funny and over all fantastic, it was a little bit dark at some points, as the children try to kill their parents (but in a comedic way). The parents kiss a lot. But just funny over all"
2680,8,-I recommend this.
2681,8,"-this movie was moving and dark. i would not recommend for young children, this movie represents neglectful parents and misrepresents social services. the parents acted as though they would be better off without the children and refused to feed, care and love the children. Sure, there were some positive messages, like that you should stick with our family and that there are people who will care about you.  But other that that it focused on the fact that the children thought that their parents would care for them even after years of mistreatment and neglect."
2682,8,-This movie is really funny.
2683,8,-I think it's good and it's like I guess it's like a really good movie so I really think its a movie for the whole family so yeah I hope everyone agrees with me about this movie it's really good.
2684,8,"-It is an amazing movie, I wanna watch it again! Actually, I've watched it two times. 'Cause it so cool. Netflix has made a great achievement. It's one of the best movies that it has made. Another person said it was a horror movie. I don't what that person is talking about! But it's their opinion. I ain't judging."
2685,7,-It was a great movie with lot's of laughs for the whole family!!!
2686,7,"-Just no. I get that it's supposed to be funny, but it's actually really dark and weird and sad. It's not good."
2687,7,"-I am new to Netflix and I have a strange phobia of movies, this is the perfect movie to fall asleep to and I find the twins the contrary of creepy! The story has beautiful animation (my mum is a producer) and the theme of candy gives it more. Must Watch"
2688,7,"-It was painful to watch. The whole time I was uncomfortable and kept thinking of how it's such a bad example and influence for kids. The main characters cause many destructive car crashes, think up ways of how to kill their abusive parents, and injure innocent people viewing their home that's up for sale.  Not to mention, it's extremely weird, random, and disjointed. My family agreed that we wished we could erase it from our minds and kept wanting to turn it off although ended up watching the whole thing. Worst movie I've ever seen. (Even worse than Cats, and that's saying something.)"
2689,7,"-I loved this movie. I thought the plot was really good and it had lots of positive messages about family. I thought this was stop-motion but then I thought it was 3D animated. Could someone please tell me if it was animated or not? There is mild themes such as being an orphan and unloving parents. Violence such as a monster popping out, but mostly slapstick violence. No language whatsoever. The word is ""What the Willoughby?"""
2690,7,"-Probably could go without the parents getting eaten at the end, and it's really weird, but it's a good movie to watch for a pre-teen."
2691,7,-I am not older than 15 but I say this movie would not apply for people under that age. In the start of the movie there is a... sound and reference to having babies... The parents are very inappropriate  and the kids set a bad example because they imagine their placenta being killed. Not for kids!
2692,7,-This movie is about some kids who try to get rid of their parents to get a normal family. I liked it because it was funny. It also had good actors.
2693,7,"-Look, I am older than eight, and I didn’t like the movie at all! Maybe I shouldn’t have watched it at night, but it is still very sad and I couldn’t sleep because of it. I stayed up until midnight because I felt my family didn't love me. Maybe you will read this and think about watching this movie. Also the first movie I hate. Thank you"
2694,7,-At the end where the bad parents are at the beach they got eaten that gave me nightmares for all my life
2695,8,-I personally think it depends on if you get quite scared at movies easily or not when your young if not I think it’s a great movie (I still love it to this day😂) if not maybe wait until your a little bit older :)
2696,8,"-This movie is really good! For me, It wasn't scary AT ALL (just weird), but my 17 yr old brother was terrified! I guess it just depends on the person. Thing that disturbed me: Mouse in dinner. Ok, i think its just me, but thats kinda gross... Thing that disturbed me: Naked Luke at the end. It was blurred, but you could tell what it was... I recommend but depends on the person"
2697,8,"-There is no bad language in this film, although it is easy to mistake ‘witch’ for something else."
2698,8,"-it is very much disturbing so please parents maybe don't let your younger child watch it, when the witch takes off her mask it reveals a very disturbing looking face which used to haunt me, first time I watched this movie I was about 5 my grandma put it on and I was very traumatised, but now as a teen it hasn't disturbed me,"
2699,8,-I first watched this when I was 7yrs old and I needed the toilet in the middle of the movie and when I was going there and back I ran soooo fast because I was scared that one of the witches was there!
2700,8,-My Rating: PG
2701,8,-If you want to watch the witches then watch 2020 but still it gave me nightmares for years and also both movies are really pushing it that Witches are real just watch the 2020 trailer in the beginning it says Withes are real and they are among us.
2702,8,-This film is actually scary no joke
2703,8,-This movie is definitely for those families who want to watch scary movies but nothing intense you know. I totally recommend this movie for everyone!!
2704,8,-Honestly this movie wasn’t that scary to me. It was really just disturbing. There’s nudity. What kind of kids thriller shows a naked little boy? Not an appropriate one. This movie would be very frightening to maybe a 12yr old. Not me. But is very disturbing. When the head witch and all the other witches go to their true form it’s gross. Good movie but not for kids.
2705,8,-I love this movie It is a great one of the first MCU movies you should show your kids
2706,8,"-Why is this only 12 plus? I think that the main form of violence was just in a bit of martial arts, and Thor’s hammer creating storms. There was a point where a robot shot heat at them and flipped over a bunch of cars. There was no swearing that I can recall, there was one kiss, that was about it. Great special effects, a few comedy moments, and an amazing plot. I loved this movie and I think you will to!"
2707,8,-It is funny and has some fighting but it is still not scary.
2708,8,"-Thor is an interesting idea. To spin Norse mythology into a superhero film is a challenging risk, but it paid off. The change of an impulsive and ignorant son to a loving and strong leader is astonishing. Nothing really bad but some action violence (non gory) and one character gets drunk. Who doesn’t love Loki? Seriously. Go watch Thor and the rest of the MCU."
2709,8,-has action/violence throughout
2710,8,-Thor is kinda thicc but could be thiccer. Thor and Spooder-man have a cool battle and almost kill each other. Sexy squidward tries to kiss Thor but does not get to. This is a ok movie that could be a little thiccer.
2711,8,"-marvel has made another great  action pact movie, but its about gods. All in all this is a great action movie with very little fighting and some kissing. For violence  there are fight scenes. Frost giants throw ice spikes and attempt to stab people with ice. when touched by a ice giant some of there skin turn purple. Someone does get stabbed. The frost giant leader almost kills oden  but loki blasts him away with a beam. Loki attempts to kill thor with a metal suit that shoots energy beams( there are exploding cars but no gets killed). At one point there is blood on thors face. In the beginning thor gets tazed by a girl. thor beats of a bunch of S.H.I.E.L.D agents( there is no blood). There is one big kiss at the end and thor is shown shirtless( not sexually). All in all this is a great movie that your 11+ year old needs to see at some point in his/her life."
2712,8,-ok movie but good for younger kids who can't watch other marvel movies yet
2713,8,-Great movie but extremely violent and kind of scary. I saw it because I always watch things above my age.
2714,7,-This movie isn't as good as Japanese Futa
2715,7,"-This film first caught my eye when I was watching the preview of the movie on the 2012 Diamond Edition DVD of Cinderella (1950) at my friends’ cabin. I saw this magical film for the first time in 2020, and loved it! This fourth installment is about Tinker Bell meeting her fraternal twin sister Periwinkle even though they can’t meet each other because the Winter Woods is too cold for warm fairies and the warmer seasons of Pixie Hollow are too hot for winter fairies. Preschoolers could be in suspense when Queen Clarion says that if the freeze spreads around Pixie Hollow, Life there would change forever and no fairy would ever fly again. Anyway, I love this movie! It’s basically Frozen with fairies instead of humans, released a year earlier (Secret Of The Wings was released in 2012 and Frozen was released in 2013) This film is one of the best ones I’ve seen of all time, there’s no scary moments at all so little kids won’t complain."
2716,7,-This movie is appropiate for all ages
2717,7,"-You grow out by three years old, I've seen that in younger kids."
2718,7,"-It is a very good movie about sisters. Any kid can watch it. No scary parts AT ALL and I am very sensitive! It got kind of boring after watching it seven times, though. I am more into watching Planes and Planes:Fire and Rescue."
2719,7,"-This installment in the benign Tinker Bell movie series shows off some serious Disney-star talent, as the McClain sisters sing a new song. The reason for the ""6 and up"" rating is only because the storyline is much more in-depth than the others, so a better attention span is needed to fully grasp this movie."
2720,7,-This movie is better for younger kids.  It wasn't very interesting for a 10 year old. The Winterland is very pretty. It teaches one not to give up and to have persistence. It also show that somebody can make a mistake and fix it.
2721,7,"-Hi, I am M9PIXAR's friend."
2722,7,-I am 7 years old and when I saw this movie I really liked it because it shows that family should be together and that sometimes you half to follow your dreams
2723,6,"-The funniest jokes out of all three Toy Story movies! Greatest quality animation out of all three,best scripts out of all three,ect.PERFECT! PERFECT! PERFECT!"
2724,6,"-Even though this is my least favorite in the Toy Story franchise, this one is still 5-star worthy. It is hilarious. The reason I rated this ""on"" for 2 or older is because anyone of any age should watch this. If your child can't handle the ""scary"" scenes, just cover their eyes so they can enjoy the rest of the movie. Overall, great movie!"
2725,6,"-This was an absolutely amazing movie, with lots of connections to the real world, and very inspiring. However, it's also pretty scary and sad, and some younger viewers might find it hard to understand hidden meanings beneath the character developments. All in all, great movie, but not for everyone."
2726,6,"-Some moments of gambling, one very scary scene where a baby twists it's head around graphically! The most scariest toy story yet! Should be a PG!"
2727,6,-Third Toy Story is the best but the most intense
2728,6,-For ages 5 and up
2729,6,-It touched my heart. Best toy story movie ever made!! I feel any age is the right age for this. There is comedy that's age appropriate and even my dad loved the film. I even have the it on DVD. The only thing you may consider inappropriate is romance between Buzz light year and Jessie and ken in one scene is in nothing but his underwear.
2730,6,-This movie rocks! There are a lot of funny moments and colorful animation! If you want to see some of the best stuff in movie history than this is the movie for you!
2731,6,-This is a really good movie. It is also a good family movie. I love toy story. Ther isn't anything bad in it that kids shouldn't see.
2732,8,-It's about demons taking over toys. Its anti jesus
2733,8,-it's a good movie but...THEY BETTER MAKE TOY STORY 5 WHERE WOODY AND BO PEEP GO LIVE WITH BONNIE AND DUKE CA BOOM GETS TO BE WITH HIS OWNER AND DUCKY AND BUNNY GET TO CONKER THE WORLD!!!!
2734,8,-this is a good movie though the only bad thing about is that creepy ventriloqist dummy he creeps me out.
2735,8,"-Some people are saying that the dummies are creepy, but I love old- time creepy stuff (please don´t judge me). The movie is good but might scare some people. Read the other reviews. "
2736,8,"-It’s okay, but I like how number 3 ends. It also is scary. Who would put slappy in a small kid’s movie?!"
2737,8,-The movie ended with the toys separating which is unacceptable.  I have watched all the movies as a kid to now and that just should not have happened. I’m an beyond irrated that this decision was made. If there is ever a toy story 5 it better be all the toys meeting up AND STAYING TOGETHER. Thank you
2738,8,"-The movie is heartwarming and I love it. Forky is consistent saying he is 'trash' and wants to go to a garbage dump, which could be portrayed as suicidal. Forky ends up staying and is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO funny, Bo Peep is strong and the movie is funny, Gabby Gabby ends up being really really sweet, the dummies arent THAT scary. I apoligize for the review I first wrote, This movie is INCREDIBLE"
2739,8,-Oh my mercy
2740,8,-:) 
2741,8,"-This series ended on August 11 of this year and it’s great! I’ve been liking the Trolls franchise since I was 9 years old, This series takes place after Trolls World Tour with multiple new trolls from every tribe, to be honest TrollsTopia was kinda a terrible idea because the pop trolls own their own land, the other trolls should move back to their old homes, the other trolls don’t have the color schemes to be in Troll Village (Except Cooper who is a funk troll) At first I hated this series but now I love it! I really like Poppy and Branch but my favorite characters from the new series are Holly Darlin and Minuet because they are so stubborn at times but funny! Fans of the Trolls franchise will love this show!"
2742,8,"-The animation style is slightly different from The Beat Goes On, (not in a bad way).  Its an adorable show,  with a great story line, considering the fact that we never got to see Trolstopia entirely in Trolls World Tour.  Sure, some of the jokes are childish, but that's ok!  If you are apart of the Trolls fandom, you will love it.  It does include ""Broppy""  Moments (Branch x Poppy) .  I love how its all about adjusting to their new way of life.  It has a great message behind it.  I recommend!"
2743,8,"-This shouldn't be G-rated. Should be TV-Y. The series is childish like the movie. Also, singing."
2744,8,"-This movie was fine, a little bit of pretty OK humor, but what really gets me is the MARKETING!! It's gone a little (a LOT) overboard."
2745,8,"-Too much sugar-coated scenes, but violence lined within the scenes. Good for little kids, But boring for older ones."
2746,8,"-Personally I think that this movie was a hit. Point dreamworks! The main character Poppy is a strong, passionate, motivated character.Now I've read a lot of other comments about how Bridget and King Gristle make quote on, quote ""Sexual Comments"" towards each other. But the thing is that dreamworks knew that  there would be multiple parents that would be dragged into the theaters as the price of their young child's happiness.So of course they are going to add something  like that into the movie.I mean, yes, there are jokes like that in this movie but they are so stupid that they just fly over little kids head.And as for the poses, Bridget makes being ""sexual"". I just want to make the point clear that they were trying to make the characters do funny things, because, it's not like you're 5 year old is going to walk up to you the day after and ask ""Mommy, why was that character making sexual poses towards the other?"""
2747,8,-I think this movie is one of the most kid friendly things I've ever seen and I mean this in a bad way because some things kind of have to be inappropriate but not to much in order to make kids laugh. And these songs just keep going and I hate them so much. The end of the movie is just so stupid. All the trolls do at the end is make the Bergens happy instead of putting them under arrest for almost eating all of the annoying trolls. I know that a lot of people like this movie but I hate it and I do not recommend it.
2748,8,"-I think that some parents should explain to their child, what is real and what is not real before going to see a -kids movie- So i really think that the parents should stop complaining about their child being so scared."
2749,8,"-I was surprised to see that someone had rated it 18+. I mean the trolls world is colorful and the scenes are very creative. I think it would appeal to a little kid. Yes, the bergen  eating trolls stuff can be a bit scary to a younger kid but its not really that scary. My friends little sister watched it and loved it. I wouldn't show it too the sensitive child though. There are fun lighthearted songs and catchy tunes. It also gives great messages. Like why you should stay on the bright side. And that you shouldn't pretend to be someone else Just to get somebody's attention, like Bridget did.  The only thing I didn't really like about this movie was how rude branch was to Poppy. After she finished singing he threw her guitar into a fire. But in the very ending they become pals. Branch also said mean things to poppy but I think kids would know not too repeat what he said. Other than that the movie is a fast paced fun loving musical  that's colorful and cute."
2750,8,"-This movie has great songs, funny moments that would make kid, teen or adult laugh.  I don’t get the too much violents thing everyone is talking about, but it’s wrong,  the movie it funny and makes you want to get up and dance to the song."
2751,8,-this is a good family movie :)
2752,8,-TROLLS is a energetic and exuberant adventure.
2753,8,-its bad i mean why so bland i cant believe how bland the story is so is another bad dream works movie so you know what to expect
2754,8,"-Not the best Pixar, but as an avid pixar fan, I watched it with my family, and I just felt really awkward with all the talk on girls puberty and boy band crushes, I thought it was too girly to enjoy, I don't recommend it. The story was terrible, the animation was fine, but it felt like an overlong puberty video."
2755,8,"-This movie encapsulates everything wrong with current culture. It's overly feminist, a tad bit racist, and relies on overused cliches to be funny.  The characters are horrible, the main character is a little s**t the entire film and is constantly whining about how perfect she is. Then as per these newer films that only kinda sorta have an antagonist we've got her borderline abusive mother. She's a total control freak, no wonder her kid is horrid. We're supposed to feel bad for the mom when her mother (Mei Mei's grandma) shows up with the rest of the aunts, and we can see the ""child inside of her"". Please. Then we've got her father. Who does absolutely nothing, zip, nil, goose egg. He is shoved aside by his wife in what can only be described as a one-sided marriage. The funny parts fall flat, the emotional parts don't exist. It's supposed to be a commentary on the life of teens growing up but I see absolutely no parrels to my own experience as a fifteen-year-old. This is a complete s**t show of a movie that doesn't deserve any of the popularity that it's recieved."
2756,8,-not a movie for little kids
2757,8,"-I’ve watched this movie about 4 or 5 times, I personally like it but I know it’s definitely not everyone’s cup of tea, it starts to talk about periods in the start of the movie and I think it’s fine but if you aren’t ready to go into conversation about periods with your children, I wouldn’t recommend it. Also, towards the beginning, Mei develops a crush on the Daisymart clerk and draws “sexy” drawings of him. Once again, if you don’t want to explain what that means to your kiddos, I don’t recommend watching this with them. Overall it’s a pretty good movie and I liked the characters!"
2758,8,-Turning Red is okay.
2759,8,-I think it would be better but I realized that there are many  seens that are for the older kids
2760,8,"-I found it really funny, intriguing and showed lot’s of metaphors for what is deemed acceptable for a woman. It was emotional and high quality! Amazing!"
2761,8,"-EW, GR0SS! W0RSE THAN CARS 2! [MAMA'S GIRL INTENSIFIES]"
2762,8,-Turning red
2763,8,"-The movie added shadow magic that is so creepy. Nory's best friend uses shadow magic to cheat on a  test. They unnecessarily had romance between Nory and Andres. Pepper was super mean and snooty. If you are sensitive to evil characters, you might not like this movie. "
2764,8,"-I haven’t read the books, but I’m pretty sure that based on some of the reviews, they were better. This movie seems so much like Harry Potter. The magic school, and the different groups (in Harry Potter, they are called different Houses, and in Upside Down Magic, they are pretty much the same exact thing). Don’t bother with this movie. I gave it two stars because I liked the singing teacher."
2765,8,"-This movie was a waste of my time. Good gracious! I'll never get that 5760 seconds back into my life. I was never down for watching this but ended up watching to see if it got any better-to be frank it didn't. Best part of this movie is that there are no laugh tracks, if there was I may have just passed out. Tons of horrible humor and cringe. At one point she said ""That's cool as heck"" I will never recover from that."
2766,8,-the movie is great because a girl is very confedeint. The headmaster isn't very nice tho. It was scary for a little but if it didn't have that it would be sappy
2767,8,-I have never read the book but I realize everyone comments mentions how it’s nothing similar. Nory in the movie is just trying everything to fit in and the whole movie is about that making it dumb. All the the other characters seem to be just thrown in there. Norys best friend? the hoy? Black magic? It’s all just thrown in there and has no point in the movie whatsoever. And that girl that introduced that magic stuff to both best friend was stupid. Like what does she have to do with it. So please do not waste ur time watching it.
2768,8,-I think it’s the best
2769,8,"-This movie is a straight ripoff of avatar the last air bender or the legend of Korra this really offended as avatar is one of the best shows to ever exist Rios off the fire,earth,air,and water thing just makes me mad"
2770,8,"-The first part was great! It was pretty different from the book though... But it was still fun to see all the magic and characters. The teachers are kind of mean, but overall, it was great! Until Reina got possessed by shadow magic and became a freaky looking shadow monster! I went into another room when this happened. I was in the other room, plugging my ears, when I heard my sister crying. All of a sudden, my mom yelled, ""Get in here and turn the TV off, right now!"" When I came in to turn the TV off I saw a huge dementor looking thing terrorizing kids on the screen. I am 10 and it scared me to tears. Not the Disney movie I want to see and not the Disney I knew."
2771,8,"-The move isn't at all like the books. In the books, Reina isn't a character, flickers turn stuff invisible, Pepper in an upside-down fuzzie, Elliot is friends with Nory and also freezes things (instead of making smoke), Sage students don't live at Sage, they live in their own house in the town of Dunwinddle (for example, Nory moved to her aunt's house so she could go to Sage Academy, Sage isn't some closed-off school in the middle of a forest (it's in the town of Dunwinddle), Pepper is nicer (she's also shy in the books), shadow magic doen't exist, they added a intro/soundtrack to the movie, and that's all the things the move changed (and made worse). I would't bother watching the movie. Oh, and in the videos on Disney Channel's Youtube channel, they NEVER ONCE credit  the makers of the books."
2772,8,"-I love the movie. so do my friends. I recognized all the actors and the movie is a little bit scary at the end, but thats 1 reason why its fun. whatch on disney now, youtube tv, ect."
2773,7,"-TVG-Rated in USA? 12 in UK. For violence and rude humor at least. This is not a good show for children. It has many ""pretend"" swear words like ""Holy chiz!"" and ""No chiz"" (parody of sh+t) and sometimes they say ""FUDGE""! I Started watching this when I was 11 and it was too much comic violence (Cat slaps Beck in the face really hard in front of the whole class) and it taught me that ""No sh+t"" cause it was so obvious what it all means. 13+"
2774,7,-Their is no sex at all but their is a lot of kissing lots their is a bit of language
2775,7,"-This is one of Nick's shows that I like, I'm not a fan of iCarly. Violence: in one episode, a character pretends to be a stunt double, and someone asks to ""clean up some blood."" A person threatens to cut off another person's head. Nothing to-to violent. Language: most of the time they say, ""oh my god."" Sex: they use words like, ""boobs."" Sometimes characters kiss in the halls, and there's also couples."
2776,7,"-This show is one of my favorites because not only is it funny with many main characters, but it also has lots of catchy songs sung by the actors. It truly is hilarious and really entertains you."
2777,7,"-Victorious is totally not for kids I think I found out that I started watching it when my friend told me that it was alright.   Later I thought it was pretty bad. The kissing, definitely is not okay for kids.   I would not do that when I am a teenager.  Jade looks like a goth on the show, and she dating Beck is something I do not want to see.   They do too many things that are not good for kids.   Trina has problems thinking she is better than everyone else.   The clothes they wear are some of the worst I have seen in my life.   The only people I think are okay are Tori and Andre.    The language is inappropriate,  and shouldn't be talking back to parents and teachers. I cant stand Robbie.  I think Disney channel has a lot better shows."
2778,7,-its a great show but I think its not little kids but mostly for teen and tweens just sayin  I love teennick  but  I think that victorious is not a show for 6 and 7 year olds .
2779,7,"-Victorious is mainly a spin-off of one of the best shows of all time, iCarly. But that's alright. After having a side spotlight in Zoey 101 (it was popular when I was like 5, so I never really watched it) and the role of Shelby Marx in iCarly the year before Victorious started, Justice has really come far with this show. At times her character Tori, along with her sister Trina (Daniella Monet) are pretty exaggerated. For example, in the episode ""Crazy Ponnie"" (where the awesome Jennette McCurdy guest stars!!!), Trina is very sick. She sneezes constantly and remarks ""OMG, look what came out of my nose!"" It can be gross and weird at times. I find Tori to be a good role model for kids, standing up for herself and believing in her dreams (not to sound clique). Jade (Elizabeth Gillies) is a rude person (much like Sam from guess-what-show) who is dating Beck (Avan Jogia) throughout much of the series. The sex symbol below my review is just indicating the times they kiss in the show. Overall, I think this was a pretty cool sitcom, but I wasn't crushed to see it go. If you liked this show, however, I suggest you check out Sam & Cat if you haven't already, which stars Cat (Ariana Grande) from this show and Sam from iCarly."
2780,7,"-This is none other than one of the greatest shows I've ever seen. Parents and kids will love it, though it is aimed for tweens and teens mostly. It circles around a group of close friends in the school called Hollywood Arts, which is a middle school and high school for artistic kids with special talents: singing, acting, puppeteering, or just being really smart, etc. Their main teacher (who teaches acting), Mr. Sikowitz (pronounced psycho wits) is unlike most teachers- a large sense of humor, a little on the odd side, but is friendly and has an addiction to coconuts."
2781,7,-OMG this is crazy this is not a bad show at all oh and btw they where not in a locked room they where in a RV they where not wearing bras they where wearing bikini tops anyone with eyes can see that but you guys wear probably where not paying attention and even if your kids thought they where wearing bras i'm pretty sure every girl wears a bra at some point in there life (I know so crazy (gasp)) and if you think they dress crazy never ever take your child outside
2782,7,-i laughed so much when i saw it the characters are very good its for kids no violence and no violence but in one episode tori hit jade but it wasnt for real so its for kids
2783,8,-This show is a great show. Tori is a great role model and if anyone has a problem with this show get off this site u haters if you take this show off the air then I will never watch nick again and those are NORMAL OUTFITS is u have a problem suck it up and go complain to ur kids not the producers you r ruining it for everyone else
2784,8,"-This show sucks, it does not even bother to be that enjoyable, it does not even show what high school is like, all it is is a school for acting and singing, WHY...JUST WHY!? these characters are not getting an education of real subjects, that is just sad."
2785,8,"-Parents! They were wearing bikini tops in 'Survival of the Hottest' and Cat is not a whore. You people are over exaggerating. Do you think Dan would ever put sexual stuff on a KIDS SHOW!? The show is completely clean. Tori never took her shirt off and lent Cat her bra. She squeezed the toilet water out of it and gave it back to her. Jade and Beck never said anything about having sex. Andre never said 'You look hot without a bra' or whatever. Your kids are gonna learn about stuff like that one way or the other. It's not like they are gonna go 'Oh, I think I'm gonna be like Jade' then go off and do mean things to people or go like 'Oh, I think I'm gonna go be like Beck' then go rent an RV, and live in it so he/she doesn't live under their parents rules. It's not Cat's fault she didn't know her friends were stuck in an RV. She went to the bathroom and went to go ask what that song was. She wasn't doing stuff in her bra, it was a stinking BIKINI TOP! Sure they use crap, chiz, or fudge as a substitute for a certian bad 'f' word, but if you tell your kids not to use that language, they wont. They might not even feel like it. Never once has this show been racist. It's completely fine for kids."
2786,8,-In my view the bit s where your suppost to laugh are just annoying.It's UNfunny and pointless.There is a very rare case where I giggle.Its a shambles and its unrealstic.
2787,8,"-Lighten up a bit guys!All of you guys who are giving this bad reviews are really WAY too overprotective about your children. The worst it actually gets is ""boobs"".Seriously. What I find funny is the minute you parents get a show which does not make us tweens feel like 6-year-olds, you go out and bag it out to the point of making things up about the show to make it look bad!  So don't listen to those weird reviews with really bad grammar, Victorious is fine for eight and up !"
2788,8,-FUN DRAMA FASHION ART TEENS all this exist on nickeldoeon victorious
2789,8,"-A bunch of self absorved, insensitive, girls walking around in short short's and screaming at each other belongs on MTV, not a kid network."
2790,8,"-I watch victoriousAnd it is very funny, like some of Cats lines but can have some bad stranger danger things. In survival of the hottest, Cat starts partying with some random boys when she says she is goring to the restroom. There is also Trina, Tori's sister that is always wearing racy clothes."
2791,8,-so rude like them kissing this is innapropreate
2792,8,-it has kissin' in it but I LUV THIS SHOW
2793,6,"-the movie was a  2 hour garbage about some girl trying to save heros and is a bad movie,So in the first few frames of this movie you  see a marvel ripoff where a guy gets 2 swords flying toward him like thor and heros look like iron man and  mt lady from my hero academia, Theres even a character named all power who is a ripoff of all might from my hero academia.  In the next frames you see a girl being bullied  by a 5 year old becuase she doesnt have powers though she wants to be a superhero  which is an obvuis ripoff to my hero academia! then they go  in a ugly base which has the students of ua high school just tweeked by there gender. a girl named guppy has a power of fire and ice and obvuis ripoff of shoto todoroki  and then theres a guy with a power to  get whichever power he wants which would be a ripoff of yayororuz and bakugo from my hero academia.another girl who can sing is a ripoff of two characters:uraraka and jiro. a kid who bends his neck is a ripoff of a guy named sero.Another kid who is slo mo but is seen digestig an exxesive amount of food is a ripoff of a guy named rikido, the start of the movie is basically avengers and a 2hour waste movie. The movie and the ending made no sense and the spaceships were balls of foams with strings on. as if not frustrating enough the ending is just a kid discovering  the aliens were nice and THE END THE WORST MOVIE IN THE PLANET! netflix gave robert rodriquez 2 hours to make a movie and 100 dollars! I want to point out robert rodriquez is a good filmmaker its just this movie that should be erased from existence"
2794,6,-Pretty disappointing.. if you haven’t see the for I guess you can sit down and enjoy it..
2795,6,-It’s okay I mean I hated it but my little sister seemed to love it I think it’s really predictable but my sis loves it basically I’m saying if your older you won’t like it as much as your children
2796,6,"-It sucked. No point.  At first when I started watching with my brother it seemed like a normal movie. But then when she was taken from her school to the ""heroics lab""... The CGI sucked. Personally I don't watch movies where kids get tortured where at the end they find out they were only being tested. DON'T WASTE 2 HOURS WATCHING."
2797,6,-watch with family members this would be the best movie for movie night! :)
2798,6,-I LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED ITI LOVED IT It has many good voices and infuces
2799,6,"-Cool movie, with positive messages all the way through. It's action-packed, and never bores you. It has a good plot and no big disappointments. Violence is very small, and wouldn't scare most kids. Though, the acting was lacking at times (like when the girl starts singing, it's almost laughable, just so ridiculous). Also there is some consumerism, as some characters always use iPads, apple stuff. "
2800,6,"-Don't watch horrible worse then my sister's nursery rhymes CGI horrible, acting sucks and it was so boring I didn't watch the full movie I watched a YouTube review and the plot is horrible this is not some kid version of the avenger's it mickey mouse and his friends as superhero's and horrible power's don't watch the joke's are so cringey and cheesy."
2801,6,-Fine to watch on a family night won't scare kids
2802,6,-I really liked it  and it was amazing
2803,8,"-This movie’s great. I feel like this movie is more accurate with the book than the new one. It’s a very cute movie with some very interesting scenes. It can be kind of scary times for younger kids, but overall it’s a sweet family movie. Definitely consider this for Friday night."
2804,8,"-This movie is better than its successor, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It shows good messages because they sing songs about what you should and should not do. My little brother likes to watch this movie and he was not frightened by the scary images. I used to watch this movie with my cousins every time they came over for Christmas."
2805,8,-This is a great movie overall. I love the book and the movie but one thing for parents. It only contains one scary scene but other than that great movie.
2806,8,-its not bad my 4 year old sister saw this and she was calm she did not say she was scared and besides its telling us kids to be honest not lie
2807,8,"-1971 Willy Wonka was great, I prefer the 1971 version over the 2005 one. Any parent/kid that says '1971 WONKA HAS BAD BAD BOTE SCENE!!!!11!! 1 STERS! EITENPLUS!' are just too much of a f****ing p***y. I love to reenact the boat scene sometimes."
2808,8,"-I was shocked to see this movie was G. G ratings are for pure, family movies. This was not pure. Kids are almost killed, their is a disturbing scene where the group rides a boat down a tunnel with scary imagery flashing on the walls, Willy Wonka is just creepy, and more. It was also weird. I liked the Tim Burton version, but this was just bad."
2809,8,"-I loved this movie so much, it is my childhood. This is darker though than I remember, I mean the boat ride, a kids film? A girl almost explodes, and a girl falls into a furnace. There probably is nothing your kids won't understand like I did, but Willy Wonka knew what he was doing, where was Agusuts Gloop's seat in the boat. I think 7 and up can watch."
2810,8,"-Good movie, I watched this when I was seven, and did not have any nightmares the night after it. However a couple of scary parts such as loud music and dark scenes, but aside from that no violence and fun movie to watch as a family, and do not worry it will not give your children nightmares from the scary parts!"
2811,8,"-Willy Wonka is a family classic; it's colorful, creative, whimsical, and funny. The songs are amazing, the plot is entertaining, the characters are full of variety, the backgrounds are a pleasure to behold, it is just an incredible movie! Even Charlie Bucket is a positive role model. It has good message about caring. An only bad role is Veruca Salt because she is a rich girl who wants everything and being spoiled but nothing an issue. These kids doing stuff who was going into a bad game show. Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka is way better than Johnny Depp's because he's more like a stranger than Gene's. Well, I like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as well. Yes, it is based on Roald Dahl's classic book. When I was a fifth grader, my teacher let do Violet Beauregard assignment and amp; me and my classmates can plot it. Yes, she becomes blue and fat. I really wish there was a school play and I watched several videos. The only iffy things about the movie are: The implications of Grampa Joe doing tobacco, Wonka's dark humor, especially regarding what will happen to the children after they break the rules, Charlie and Grandpa Joe drinks soap, And of course, the deranged boat ride. We all remember that, and what was going on, but for those who do not, well, Wonka takes everyone on a boat ride, a calm, quiet, Wonka-style boat ride...which soon enters a dark tunnel, which shows images of a worm entering a guy's mouth, a chicken getting its head chopped off, something gross involving a bug or lizard and I don't think I wanna find out what it is, and also, Wonka starts singing and he sounds progressively more psychotic as the song goes on, and by the end he is screaming the lyrics as most of the guests on the boat are terrified. Ok, well that went insane very quickly. Though never scared me but these characters especially casts get scared. Nothing sexy stuff but when you look for ""inflammation"" like Violet, then you may find it inappropriate by Deviantart users because they looked thicc and very fat. I really liked to see the candy garden and there is filled with candy. But aside from those aspects, overall a wonderful family film! I recommended for ages 7!"
2812,8,-It's really nice but there are some scary scenes. 
2813,8,-This movie is the best! Awesome songs and a great plot! YOU REALLY SHOULD WATCH!
2814,8,"-This movie is a masterpiece! The actors are absolutely brilliant. Meg donnelly has definitely improved her acting to be one of the best on the film too! Milo manheim was as good as ever. All the actors from zombies 1 were as amazing as ever. The new actors were absolutely fantastic! Chandler kinney as willa had the seriousness and sarcasm. Pearce Joza as wyatt had the seriousness and the comedy. Ariel Martin (Aka Baby Ariel) had the comedy and the adorableness! The plot was amazing. I don't know why people are saying it was rushed and they didn't know what was going on. I understood all of it. They were probably just on their phones not paying attention. The characters even had character development from the first film! The songs are much better too! I have had them in my haed ever since it came out! The dances are amazing too. There is one kiss ate the end between zed and addison but you can't really see it : zed kinda covered addison's face with his heads so it wasn't explicit or any thing. There was no sexualised dancing or movements like there was in descendants 3. It was still a bit cheesy but its from Disney channel, what do you expect? The breaking of the fourth wall was a bit weird but if you look past that it is amazing! It might be a bit scary for 4 and below ages when the werewolves ""wolf out"" (their eyes light up and they bare their fangs and claws) but it depends on the child. There are no bad role models either so if your child looks up the actors in interviews and YouTube in general they will see amazing young people that are kind, funny and good people. Overall film is epic and I definitely recommend it to you."
2815,8,"-I love this movie! I liked this first movie a lot but I think this is even better. The songs are really catchy and I like them. There is some mildly freighting scenes, but I really like the plot! You will want to watch the first one first or else it won't make much sense. The effort put in to the speech, songs and scenery are amazing. A must-watch for me!"
2816,8,"-Zombies 2 is a pretty lukewarm movie. It's not awful, but the acting is just not my favorite and the plot is kind of all over the place. Also, there's so many things about this movie that don't make sense- like, if the mayor reinstated all monster segregation laws, then why were the zombies and werewolves still at school?"
2817,8,-It has quality acting and I loved it. It has a few songs that are really catchy and it has a clever layout and ideas. I LOVED when Addison thinks she’s a werewolf but she isn’t and in the end her hair glows in her sleep so it implies that she really is a werewolf and in the background it’s a full moon. I think that the necklace only worked in the moonlight. Very good film and even some parents will enjoy it. All kids should see it but I think mostly 9 year olds like it more
2818,8,-this is my favorite one so far (i know there is only 2) i think its cool how Addison is so accepting of all creatures a definite stuck at home watch need
2819,8,"-These people needs to learn the definition of zombies. They are dead eating humans that eat other humans, not nice zombies. Also there isn't a bracelet to control zombies. That's so dumb."
2820,8,"-Zombies 2  the film is amazing. I loved the dancing and the songs, they were really good and I can't decide which song is my favourite: Flesh and Bone, We own the night, or The call to the  wild? I especially love the wolves, and also Addison,who wants to find where she  belongs, it's a mystery!  "
2821,8,-I think it is a great movies for kids. Some parts may be a little scary for younger kids.
2822,8,-it is better than zombies but i hate that addison just goes with the wolves when she's not one also zed steals addison's necklace bucky is offensive he treats zombies horibly and everyone is scared of werewolves
2823,7,-Zootopia is a a awesome disney movie for families it has just about everything you would want in a animated movie mystery action great charecters and it has a great plot  I would really recommend watching this movie
2824,7,"-Wonderful film! Judy's personality is a WONDERFUL role model. Interesting and humorous! Judy's right, try your best!"
2825,7,"-This moving story tells you about how we should be open to all races, and I totally agree. Amazing."
2826,7,"-A classic underdog story, Judy a bunny in a world full of animals wants to become a police officer but she instead is a meter maid. After she is told to resign she instead takes on a missing persons case and after solving it she is seen as a hero. There are some sex jokes and there are even a  few references to Breaking Bad but no one under 12 would even notice them."
2827,7,"-From the creators of Frozen and Big Hero 6 comes an all-new original story that brings us laughs, love, and adventure in this new original film. Judy Hopps is a young bunny with the dream of becoming a police officer, despite constant reminders that a bunny cop is a crazy idea. Her wish is granted when she is dubbed the very first rabbit police officer and heads off to Zootopia, a multi-mammal paradise where predator and prey seemingly live in peace and harmony. With the weight of a new case on her shoulders, Judy must race against time to solve the mystery and prove that she is more than your average dumb bunny. However, in the midst of a shifty fox named Nick, her job is about to get a whole lot harder. Disney has brought us a remarkable production that defies stereotypes, embraces friendship, and shows us the true outcome of perseverance. And after all, what's not to like? The animation is beautiful, the voice cast is spot on, and the script is brilliant. Judy Hopps is far from your average dumb bunny. She's clever, witty, determined, and encouraging. Nick Wilde starts out as a shifty scam artist fox, but with the help of Judy, he learns the error of his ways and looks past his own stereotypes while assisting her. While this movie has numerous positive messages and role models, it has a fair amount of peril and language. (SPOILER ALERTS) Predators go ""savage"" and chase Judy and Nick. There is a jump-scare when a tiger jumps from out of the darkness in its cage. Early in the movie, 9-year-old Judy is pushed and clawed across the face by a bully fox, and later in the movie, Nick has a flashback to when he was bullied by other animals. There's an explosion, a train crash, and falling from heights. Mr. Big threatens to ""ice"" Nick and Judy, or drown them in icy water, but he changes his mind at the last minute. In one scene, it appears that Nick has turned savage, and he bites Judy. Aside from all of the violence, there is frequent name-calling, with insults such as ""jerk,"" ""stupid,"" ""dumb,"" ""loser,"" and at least three uses of ""oh, my God."" At one point, it seems as though someone has said ""hell,"" but they really didn't. The only sex is an animal naturalist club where mammals meet together without clothes; it's extremely awkward for Judy, but audience members probably won't be rattled. Amidst all of this, there's a good amount of humor in the movie. Some references, such as the DMV or The Godfather, probably won't be as obvious to the kids, but there's still plenty of laughs in there for young viewers, too. There are also great messages about teamwork, friendship, perseverance, anti-bullying, following your dreams, and looking beyond stereotypes. All in all, this is probably one of 2016's greatest films (quite honestly being the 24-highest-grossing film of all time), and it is definitely worth seeing."
2828,7,-Good to watch once ....
2829,7,-At first before I saw this I thought it would be a lame animated kiddie movie but in the end it was pretty cute. It has great messages for kids like not to give up. The trailer might turn you off from seeing the movie because it doesn't really show what the movie is about but any little kids will probably enjoy. There is one or two dark scenes where animals are locked in cages that kids who get scared easily might not like. This is a great movie to watch as a family with younger kids.
2830,7,"-I'm ticked at these parent reviews. ""Our 10 year-old couldn't sleep at night."" What? Your child was scared at a playful acting scene between two characters acting to fight? I don't know what kids these days fantasize about, but Jesus only knows. This movie is phenomenal, best animated movie in history.  It shows you that the blacks shouldn't be against whites, or vice versa. We're all in this together as America. If you're gonna get aggressive to be aggressive, the cops are coming. This is a great movie with all the anti-cop BLM bullcrap going on. Great message, adorable characters."
2831,7,"-Honestly, this movie is very good. I thought it was MUCH better than The Secret Life of Pets. Well, at least older kids my age might think so. Take your kids to see Secret Life of Pets because for a kid movie, this movie is pretty mature. I am nine years old and thought this movie was VERY scary. The animals go ""savage"" and act like they're drunk. Theres a scary black jaguar part when he goes crazy and a animal almost purposely drowns the main characters in cold water! BUTTTTT, on the good side, this movie has really good messages and awesome likeable role models. So before letting your pre-schoolers see this movie think about my reveiw. But if your a parent of  a pre-schooler than I recommend you watch this."
2832,8,"-Zootopia was a very good movie. It was funny, beautiful, and heartwarming. But don't be fooled; Adults can enjoy this movie just as much as kids can. There's even a not-so-subtle Breaking Bad reference. This movie deals with subjects such as bullying, and racism (A big part of the plot revolves around making predators look bad, and making people treat them differently.) Some animals ""go savage"" and there is some jumpscare scenes with these ""savage"" animals. Overall, this movie promotes friendship and equality."
2833,8,"-There are some good and funny moments and some bad and scary moments. But what really freaked me out was the ""Savage animal part"" (with the panther and the otter). Seriously, I was really scared. I had trouble sleeping. There was no hint of the violence in the trailer. But the rest was awesome and funny."
2834,8,"-I went to the theater with my 8-year-old brother and he was really scared because of the violence. I don't think 9-year-olds can handle too much violence but, 10-year-olds, yeah. They have the ESRB rating E10+ which is similar to PG with mild violence. So it is suitable for those 10 and up. There could be some good messages there."
2835,8,-It is an awesome movie! I saw it just a couple of days ago.
2836,8,-Note: Spoiler
2837,8,"-Took my 6 yr old girls to this and I really wish I would have checked this website before hand because it was too scary for my sensitive girls.  They were frightened most of the movie and cried a little too.  The movie is fast paced and it's about 90% scary parts.  There wasn't enough light hearted or sweet or funny parts to balance out the scary.  Over all it was a good movie with lots of great messages, especially for what is going socially right now and the spectacle that this election has turned out to be...  It's just not appropriate  for anyone under 8 or 9."
2838,8,"-Before I saw it, I thought that it wouldn't be great, but I was wrong. There are great role models, but there are some sort of intense chase scenes, and towards the end, Judy gets a cut that I had to look away from ( although I'm a  hemophobe )  Overall, it has good characters, good lessons, and awesome music."
2839,8,"-This movie was amazing! I want to be a director when I grow up (and I'm also type 1 diabetic, if you don't know what that is PLEASE look it up), so Judy inspired me a lot! I loved the messages of prejudice and ""anyone can be anything"". However, there are a couple uses of ""darn"", one use of ""Oh My God"" and a couple uses of ""heck"", me and my family weren't offended but other families might be. Also, there were some families with toddlers and preschoolers who came to the theater. I didn't think they should've came because there were a couple scenes of ""savage"" animals going crazy. (cough cough not rating Frozen G cough cough) I was comfortable (but there was one scene where the whole theater jumped out of their seats), but I noticed at least 5 little kids leaving the theater early and 1 kid who made it to the end was crying and screaming ""Mama! Papa!"" in the parking lot. Don't send your little kids to this movie. Any kids who are 9 and older (maybe mature 8 year olds), teenagers and adults should go to this movie! Me and my mom are planning on going to see it again and pre-ordering it on Apple TV."
2840,8,"-I saw Zootopia in the movie theater and the kids there were TERRIFIED. There was a scary (for them) jump scare in a scary setting. Also, there was a lot of adult references but they would probably go over your kid's head."
2841,8,-I saw it at the drive-in. My brother totally SCREAMED HIS HEAD OFF and we had to leave early!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2842,7,-This is an excellent movie for older kids. There are references to drugs and Breaking Bad a tv show for adults
2843,7,-Everything was great about this
2844,7,"-Ok, so I suppose you may think Gazelle may dress a LITTLE skimpily, but c'mon, it wasn't really revealing and kids probably won't think much of it. As for the scene where the animals are doing yoga, sure, they aren't wearing anything but they're ANIMALS for goodness sake.  Most kids in the theatre just found it funny. The trailers are kind of misleading I suppose, but the movie isn't too violent. Younger children and sensitive older children may be frightened by scenes such as (SPOILER) when Judy and Nick are chased by the panther, but that isn't too scary to cause nightmares. There are also great messages like you can be what you want and it also encourages your children to fight stereotypes and prejudice. It also has many funny parts and the story is quite interesting and engaging. Although there are several frightening bits, it is mostly light hearted humour. Overall, a great movie for teens and older children about 10 and up as they are probably this movie's target audience and also for adults I guess, younger children about 7 to 10 may not get some parts but they should still enjoy the movie."
2845,7,"-""That was THE BEST movie EVER!"""
2846,7,"-Zootopia is one of the best disney movies yet. it has great role models, and good messages. You should really watch this one, it's one of the best. "
2847,7,"-I came to see Zootopia with my friends thinking it was going to be a goofy little kids' movie....I was wrong! Zootopia was absolutely amazing and beautiful. It really seemed to capture themes of following your dreams and standing up against bullies; it was a very inspiring movie. HOWEVER. I would NOT recommend taking a child under the age of 8 to this movie. The trailers are extremely misleading- there are plenty of scenes I can think of that are pretty violent and scary. During a particular scene, that was supposed to be funny, at the beginning, many small children started crying and it was not a pleasant experience for them. The movie was more or less a crime-drama full of action and some comedy for adults. But if your child is mature, welcome to Zootopia!"
2848,7,"-This was a beautiful movie full of lighthearted, witty humor and plenty of sweet and poignant moments. Those saying that this is ""too scary"" or ""violent and sexual"" need to, to put it bluntly, get a thicker skin. This was an excellent film about tolerance; I could have seen it at age five, but gave it a 7+ rating because of a jumpscare or two. I wholeheartedly recommend this for the entire family."
2849,7,-Good movie. Very creative. Sometimes a little scary. A little sad sort of. Liked it very much. My parents and 7 year old sister liked it to. Funny. Heart warming. Definitely worth seeing.
2850,7,-I think this movie is good for ages 10 and up because it was very intense and scary but it teaches you a lesson. I was very scared when the panther attacked the bunny and the fox. My little sister was so scared that she followed my mom all around the house.
2887,6,"-This book-based adaption is the first epic chapter of the Harry Potter saga. Young kids will want to see this film, and I say go ahead. But for some sensitive children, the ""man with two faces"", ""you know who"" and Snape may scare young viewers. There is also some blood (unicorn), intense duels between wizards and near-death situations involving the main characters."
2888,6,"-I absolutely love the Harry Potter books and movies! I read/watched them (for the first time) when I was 9 years old.  They are indescribably ingenious, I cannot think of one flaw.  Everything about them is excellent!  This is a must-see!"
2889,6,-Just love this movie! ON for everyone! It's a bit scary and violent but ON 100% ON! WATCH IT!
2890,6,"-This film is delightful and exciting, it delivers a great message but may be too repetitive and it is a bit too far fetched, the thing was he appeared to make no mistakes and he was perfect the whole way through. And this is were the film trips up. It will be plain boring if he does not do something wrong or have a weakness. But the plot gripped me in."
2891,6,-My rating PG for: brief violence.
2892,6,"-This is a good start to the world of sci fi movies, kids will especially enjoy this, teens maybe. There is nothing at all inappropriate about this movie it could actually be rated G, the only part that may scare kids is the man with Voldemort on the back of his head. Overall you really just need to know your child."
2893,6,"-Spoiler Alert! At the part where they go to the zoo, and Dudley is pressed up against the glass, he pushes Harry and Harry is on the concrete floor, and the glass disappears and Dudley falls in. That's the funny part.  The exciting part is when he encounters the mirror of Erised the third time because the first dark arts teacher has the head of Voldemort on the back and he has the power to throw fire from his hand when he encounters Harry. When Harry wakes up, he's in the hospital wing, and Dumbledore is with him."
2894,6,"-If you would like wizards and witches, this is the movie for you.  Be warned:  If you're afraid of ghosts, choose a different movie 'cause it has ghosts in it."
2895,6,"-Harry Potter takes place in Hogwarts wizarding world of London. It is about a boy named Harry Potter who goes to the wizarding world. It has some violence with wands but no guns or stuff like that. There is some swearing, but the movie has some positive messages and positive role models. I recommend kids age 10 and up can watch harry potter movies with an adult."
2896,6,-This movie is when Harry first arrives at Hogwarts. It was really true to the book- there were some skipped parts. I like Harry Potter because he always goes on adventures.
2979,3,"-More special effects thann anything else. Lots of violence as well as almost constant swearing, including some brief sexual references  and more"
2980,3,"-This action epic tale of survival is a must see by James Cameron. Though the story is sometimes rough, the heart in it is that a disabled man has the commitment to not follow his orders and protect a planet called Pandora. But parents beware: there are some extremely frightening and violent scenes that some children cannot watch because of the intensity of them. There is one brief mating scene (kissing) plus flirting, and the Na'vi are barely dressed. There is lots of strong language (s--t, holy s--t, bulls--t) and milder words, but there are no F-bombs. Although this film has some content that is not for kids, Avatar is fine for mature 12-year-olds and up."
2981,3,-This movie isn't as good as everybody says it is
2982,3,"-Avatar is an great movie for kids 11+. The language I can handle, but the naked people was RIDICULOUS!! Like why-wear-any-clothes naked! O_O The messages the movie is sending are good though - The People (blue people) are working together and are always watching out for each other. Another thing I liked was that The People were trying the preserve their earth and the other people were destroying it. Again, I would say only 11 year olds  should watch this movie. Thanks for reading :)"
2983,3,"-This is a good movie. However, you may want to watch this with your family."
2984,3,"-Avatar is a very good movie for tweens, teens, and adults in my opinion. When I saw this movie, I absolutely loved it! Even though I'm just a kid, I have to say that this movie was very inspiring. It shows a great planet with magnificent scenery and landscapes...however, it can be depressing to some because of all that. As our planet is being destroyed, we see a beautiful planet on-screen. I can understand how that could be disturbing to some people..."
2985,3,"-It's thrilling, lovely, sad and explosive in all the right ways. Once again, Director James Cameron has delivered an extraordinary film. There is at least one man in Hollywood who knows how to spend $250 million wisely to create an excellent action-packed visual spectacle."
2986,3,-cbhfh
2987,3,"-Avatar was overall a pretty good movie. There is quite a lot of violence like people killing each other with guns, machine guns, and bow and arrows. There is also heavy dutie explosions that may be to intence for younger viewers. There is only one scene featuring sensuality. There is quite a bit of language that is not always necessary. There is not very much drinking drugs or smoking except one of the lead characters smokes a couple of times. Otherwise I really enjoyed Avatar!"
2988,3,-Oh My God there is a lot of language. I mean whenever someone said a bad word. I just froze. And I am not begiining to trust Comen Sence Media. Because in the end war a girl said. Not the only one with a gun u Bi*ch
3008,8,"-At level one, the game is fairly boring, but that makes getting a buddy at level five feel great. There aren’t many Pokémon to catch if you just sit there, which is frustrating at times but also promotes being active which some parents might appreciate. The game really starts to pick up around levels 15-20 and it takes a week or two to get there, but I’d say it’s worth it for better CP Pokémon and a real chance at winning battles. It’s actually really fun if you’re willing to walk around and get the hang of the controls. The IV system is a bit frustrating and beginners don’t know how to use it, resulting in the discard of potentially great Pokémon. My main issue with this game is the intense consumerism. The game clearly cares a LOT about money as opposed to customer experience, which is sad, but the customer experience is honestly fine anyways. I said a lot of negative things about the game in this review but the truth is, it’s quite fun."
3009,8,"-Hi my name is blue, I’ve been playing Pokémon go for 6 years! It’s super fun. Every month they have something called a community day which you can catch exclusive shiny Pokémon which encourages you to go outside and have fun. I rate this game for 4+ because it could be confusing for under 4 and under 4 doesn’t really know how to walk on a road nor use a phone so it would be useless to let them play.  There is some stufff that cost money and sometimes some events are rigged to get you to pay for stuff like incense but you can still play. FREE 2 PLAY and get far in the game. All in all I love this game and I ALWAYS will."
3010,8,"-Exciting, active game marred by privacy and safety issues."
3011,8,-Pokémon GO is better to play with friends than alone - it’s great to trade with other trainers so you or the other trainer can get the Pokémon you want! 
3012,8,-This game is completely good for kids. 
3013,8,-Pokemon GO is a good game. I love playing and I am a Level 14 Trainer as a part of Team Valor. WARNING- CENSORED FOR DIFFICULTY
3014,8,-Loppunny=thicc
3015,8,"-It is absolutely amazing! This is just so cool. If you want a game that’s just full of cool Pokémon and encourages you to get a lot of exercise a day, then play this! Like, one time, I was looking for a specific Pokémon, and I walked about seven miles that day! I got so much exercise! It’s amazing how they designed it where you have to walk to make Pokémon appear. And there are so many add-ones, like raids, where it encourages people to get together with each other and tap their phone screen to use their personal Pokémon to defeat a very strong Pokémon. Once the raid is over, you will have a chance to catch the Pokémon you battled, and it can be shiny! Shiny means that it is a different colour to what it would normally look like, and shinies are very rare. But some raids, like mega raids, have a Pokémon that is in its mega form. When you do raid battles, like, say, against a Pokémon called Mega Banette, instead of catching it in its mega form, you catch it as a normal Baynette and it gives you enough mega energy to mega evolve that Pokémon, so you have to collect lots of mega energy if you want to evolve your Pokémon! You can get shinies in the wild, and there are Pokestops. They are blue, spinnable disks that you swipe on your screen to make them spin. Once you do that, it will give you helpful items like Pokeballs. "
3016,7,-Look at POGGGGIEBOYSSS's review in this page!!!!!!! XD
3017,7,-its family friendly and good and cooool I'm now
3018,7,"-Sure, the movie has Pikachu saying half of the S Word and Tim or Lucy saying the full S Word, but other than that it is a great movie for kids 8+."
3019,7,"-I think this movie is awesome! There are false suspects, and it incorporates a funny Pikachu!"
3020,7,-its a great movie to watch it may have some words l=that are inappropriate but its not too big of a deal and if we take out the inappropriate words its a perfect pg movie although i do recommend this to be a movie for kids who are 11 years or older
3021,7,-this is for kids there isn't anything inappropriate there is some violence but not bloody or gory there isn't anything sexual maybe like a tiny bit but not a whole lot
3022,7,"-I really liked this film, and other families should see it too. It might not be for young and sensitive kids, but I enjoyed it. There was some dark humor, but I didn't care, because I kinda like dark humor... :D"
3023,7,"-This movie is so good, especially since I've been playing the original red and blue all the way up to sword and shield pokemon games. This movie I entirely recommend. It definitely could be described as a fun, quirky, but slightly dark, movie. It might get a bit creppy when you see the ditto( I hate all the people who said slimy pokemon he's my favorite) And It gives a lot of character. The film was very original! I love it"
3024,7,-Greatyt
3035,8,-You should for sure get this for your kids it will make them read!
3036,8,-I am 14 years old and I am in high school and I still like and read these books
3037,8,"-Overall, this book is actually pretty good. Sex: Greg's younger brother brings a magazine of a woman in a bikini for show and tell at his preschool. Violence: Greg breaks Rowley's head, and teens make Rowley eat spoiled cheese. Language: Greg's study group writes down bad words."
3038,8,-These books and movies are incredibly funny! Im addicted to this series.also the movies but books are better. Don't be afraid to let children 6 and up read and watch this.So excited for the new book also!
3039,8,"-Diary Of a wimpy kid is a wonderful book. I've read the whole series. So this review counts as the whole series. These kinds of books are very rare. Because they are not boring, their kid like.  And I think I'll stick to being a kid."
3040,8,"-In the first edition, Greg explains the beginning of his middle school life and how he gets through it.  A great start for the series.  I started reading this book in third grade and my mom spied on me.  She read the first 5 pages and said that book was being returned to the library as of immediately.  But by the end of 5th grade, she felt I was mature enough to understand what the book had to say, and take every word of it for humor.  I'll say this, I think my teachers were happy to finally see me reading a book by myself.  Lol."
3041,8,"-Diary of a wimpy kid is a funny,nice book to read I recommend this book to kids because it teaches them that sometimes school could be difficult with the people in it but in general it teaches us about how school is going to be and there There is going to be ups and downs on the way and we can't  give up. The character is name Greg and has a tuff time fitting in."
3042,8,"-It's not just that it's not as funny as the new ones, there's also more language. Examples are ""kissing his b-u-t-t"" and ""s-u-c-k it up"" could be issues. Also, I don't doubt it's happened to middle school kids, but, bullies in a truck is WAY too horrible. If you're gonna read the book because you wanna read the books in order, take my advice and get it over with."
3043,8,"-When I was younger, I loved these books. Now that I'm older and have read them again, I realize how awful they are. Greg is awful to Rowley, his so-called ""best friend."" He doesn't realize how mean he is to him. Greg always avoids being nice to others and doing the right thing, but the way it's written, it seems that it's the other way around: everyone is mean to Greg (which is still true) and he is completely innocent (which is not). He shows no appreciation for anything and is a huge downer. Also, girls are portrayed in a very stereotypical ""middle school girl"" way: shallow, easily manipulated, and dumb. This book has no positive role models or messages in it. Also, some of the humor is just downright disgusting, like a rotten piece of cheese on the hardcourt at school that Rowley is forced to eat by a gang of teenagers. There are far worse things that I don't even want to mention. This book is okay for kids that understand that Greg is not a good role model, but not many kids of the age that enjoy these books  know that."
3044,8,"-This is a good book with a funny plot. Some parents may not want their kids exposed to bullying and crushes, but otherwise it is pretty innocent. I don't remember even one kiss or a hit. Although the main character Greg is a pretty bad role model."
3045,8,-It's the best book ever!
3046,8,-I have this book and I'm thinking it's the best in the series!!!!!!!
3047,8,"-Well, next year i'll be going into middle school, but right now i'm in the fifth grade. I think if your kid is in the 5th grade and up, this would be excellent because the events in this book are things that can very well happen in middle school."
3048,8,-I think this book is suitable for any child aged 9 up because its very interesting and no bad stuff older people would say. I loved the book when i read it. This book is my favourite :)
3049,8,"-I like this book, It is so funny, I love it!"
3050,8,"-I really liked the book because it was funny, and kind of realistic."
3051,8,"-I Thought This Book Was Disgusting. I Read Half a Chapter Then Returned The Book. Seriously, I Thought This Book was Going To Be Good Because My Friends Liked It. The Book Is SOOOO Expensive 12.99 For a Book I HATED. It Has Dumb Child Humor I Hate Too. Why Is Everything BOYS in this Book It Is all Gender Stereotypical. The Author Is Just In It For the Money, and To Bribe Boys Into Buying This Book."
5067,6,"-If you ask me many cartoons they make are just mindless stupidity and the despicable me movies aren't in that category. They're appropriate, funny & kids might actually learn a thing or two if they watch this."
5068,6,"-Despicable me 2 is a great movie and all, but there is violence. There are guns, but only jelly guns and jelly cannons. And at one point minions are stabbed with a needle transplanting a purple toxic that will turn anything into a big, scary monster. One minions are transformed, they are tested by throwing a car at it, and the new minion swallowed it whole. A gun is fired at it, but it is not harmed. But it is a good movie but it involves only ONE kiss. It also involved Gru and two minions and a big scary El Macho monster. But it is a good movie, and there are ups as well as downs. Gru said once: Never get older to agnes. And also, it no drinking because in one scene beer is subbed with ice cream, so they are probably trying to make it appropriate for kids. Despicable me is a great movie!"
5069,6,-I had to take a second look at this film to see really it's form of humor and it's actually pretty funny and silly! I liked it! It's very kid friendly because kids like that kind of crap! I like it too! It's hilarious! It' way funnier than the first film! It has less sappy moments even though there is one sappy moment in it you can get cheered up a little bit after that because during that scene the minions are doing silly stuff! There are a couple adult jokes but they do that in most kids movies anyway and they are anything major at all! They are just kind of there....
5070,6,"-Stupid. Stupid humor. Stupid reactions and counter reactions from the characters. Stupid, cliche`d plot. Stupid minions; they only exist to provide a lame, failed distraction from the feeble fluff that is called the substance of the film. "
5071,6,-I loved it. I thought it was funny and it was totally appropriate for all ages. Despicable Me 2 is the best. I hope they come out with a 3rd one.
5072,6,"-I don't see any problems expect action and humor. There is some dates, and wedding, but that's fine. Gru And Lucy Kiss ONCE In the movie shown. I liked the first Despicable Me better, but this one was still good. I didn't really think these movies are too funny. But I still really liked it."
5073,6,"-If you want a movie slightly worse than the original, this is your choice. It was good and kids of any age will love it. How ever kids under five wouldn't understand the jokes."
5074,6,"-A well done animated sequel that lacks the originality of the original.  However, it is most defiantly funnier then the first, and an overall good movie that I would be fine with watching again."
5075,6,"-Minions make everything funnier, including this hilarious movie, which I would recommend for all ages! I think even adults would love this movie!"
5076,6,-Good Family Film
5077,7,"-Hilarious. It didn't surpass the first, which is better, but it has some funny moments, especially from the minions and sweet romance. One of the best animated films. One of the best 3D films ever, especially the ending."
5078,7,"-i was actually surprised at this sequel. i thought it was going to be bad but i laughed alot in this one and i was surprised at how much more the minions did in this one. yes in the first they were funny but they didn't do much, in this one they do more which surprised me. the purple minions will scare little kids though and it did get abit predictable at times [well for me anyway]. so in the end this is a good, funny sequel to a good funny first movie."
5079,7,-There's some mild action/violence
5080,7,-More minion and romance in silly sweat sequle
5081,7,-I think this is very family friendly. You should take your kids to see this. A must see for everyone
5082,7,"-Despicable Me 2 is a funny and family friendly film. It does feature some cartoon violence and one mild scary scene of a purple minion trying to attack little girls. Overall, this film is funny and for anyone who wants to see more minions !!!!"
5083,7,"-No Problem with Language or violence, one scene might be scary for kids under 5 when the minions go out in the dark and hear something but everything else it fine for kids! really funny too! i liked it equal to the first one! kids under 5 wouldn't really understand what's happening because they don't know too many words but i loved it! had to see it twice!This Should Be the MPAA rating and the reason: This Film Is Rated: PG for: Mild Action"
5084,7,-I rated this 4 because I think that this movie is awesome and I'm a teen and I loved it and I think adults will love it is relatable and funny but some parts really young kids may not get but over all really good!!! :)
5085,7,-Awesome really funny. I came out still laughing! Better then the first one. Also  way more funny then the first.
5086,7,-its so good and more minions is funnier for little kids and very funny for adults now gru is maybe better now the bad guy is cool and theres a little violence but for small kids
5087,7,"-This movie is funny. My favorite part is when that werewolf howled in front of the moon. The moon vanished and the werewolf turns back into a man. The man was briefly naked, but he covered up his private parts and ran away. Also, there's a brief shot of Gru's infant buttocks depicted (in a photo album)."
5088,7,-very GOOD
5089,7,-This movie teaches kids how to really be a hero. Animation is GREAT!!
5090,7,-the only element of concern is the one scene where the minions are printing another minion`s butt but even then it`s not graphic it only last for 23 seconds and it`s yellow minions for crying out loud not humans
5091,7,-Despicable me is not my favorite movie but I like gru and vector.
5092,7,-Hahah funny. This film is brilliant. Brilliant because of the funny characters and content. Some language like stupid and looser is included in there but i think little kids and above would enjoy it. I know i certainly did :D
5093,7,"-This is the best movie of all time. Period. The voice talents in this movie are fantastic (love Steve Carrell as Gru!) and the overall story is fabulous. I've watched this movie so many times and will never forget that a vector is ""a quantity represented by an arrow going in both directions."" The movie does have more than one reference of potty humor, but overall it is a good movie for kids ages 6 and up. Watch this movie! You won't regret it!"
5094,7,-This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen! I've never laughed so much in a theater before!
5095,7,-Watch right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!! funnyest movie ever!!! NOW NOW NOW! (PS: I would recommend superviing them if they are under 6)
5096,7,"-This movie is very,very,very good. I definitely recommend it.  : )"
5429,8,-There are some inappropriate staff for young kids but beside that it’s really funny. It is also a little bit scary but only for young kids. You should really watch that.
5430,8,"-I have seen many scary movies in my life, but this one literally gave me a painc attack. The monsters are scarier than IT the clown, the violence is insane, and there is a scene where the whole family walks out of a strip club, because Shazam teleported them there. This movie should NOT be 12+, it should be for very mature teens. I will never ever see this movie again, and neither should any other kid."
5431,8,-I went to see it with my mum and two brothers(8 14) and was generally happy with what I saw the boardroom scene is a bit intense for some children but I see so many Asia Ltd over reacting about it they should have done more research. There’s a strip club seen witch is questionable but understandable at the same time. Great movie
5432,8,-It was a great funny movie but there were things that were really scary and a lot of violence.me and my friend called the creatures tongue gremlins because they had gnarled warted drooling tongues and they were called the seven deadly sins from Pandora’s box in Greek mythology and the bible they were really scary and there was a lot of high pitched screaming and people turning to ash which was unsettling it was a very scary movie but nothing  inappropriate
5433,8,"-Okay, so I'm 9 this year, a Gifted Education Program kid studying in Singapore. I understood the plot very well, and although there was a bit of violent parts inside the movie, it was not too scary. However, you can still watch the movie if you are aged 7 and below; just skip the first part and pretend to go to the toilet for about 15 mins, then return back to the cinema. For the rest, do NOT skip any part of the movie even if it was scary: go to the toilet only if you want to pee or poo. I will tell you the 2 scary parts in this movie;"
5434,8,"-Shazam is great. I was no tscared of the boardroom scene because, there is no blood at all and cant see much killing later because its all behind a frosted glass. I did not notice any sex in the movie there is  no kissing at all. I thought the characters Freddy,Billy and Shazam are funny people that probably want to know about superheros and know have there own superhero. I liked the movie so much that I watched it twice. I recommend  my friends and other kids to watch the movie."
5435,8,"-WARNING, SPOILERS . I can see why some people might enjoy this film: the humour, the superheroes, the action. But, honestly, it’s way too scary for children!"
5436,8,-It’s a very good film with a little bit of violence and swearing BUT it has got some positive messages. I think kids can watch it :D
6953,8,-It’s appropriate but might be boring for younger kids
6954,8,-I loved all the little details about Lego and the cool Lego sets it showed. I would recommend this to others.
6955,8,"-When I watched this, it made me want to get  out a Lego set and start building without the instructions. I didn't know that you could design your own Lego set and people on vote on it to make it available in the shops. Really interesting."
6956,8,-This is so fascinating. I finally know why Lego™ is so famous. This is recommended for everyone who a fan of Lego™.
6957,8,-Suggested rating: G
6987,7,"-While Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein is a bit darker than most Alvin stories, its light peril will only frighten the littlest of viewers. Expect a cute spooky story little ones will love."
6988,8,"-Among Us a fun, easy-to-learn multiplayer game. Generally, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone under 10, as it requires solid deductive reasoning and communication skills. "
6989,8,-The game banned me for 714mins when my pc crashed it said I purposely left the game.
6990,8,"-I LOVE Among Us, however, my only complaint was the chat allowed all players inside the game to say whatever they wanted to, and most times it wasn't completely appropriate for youngers. However, Among Us has recently had a new update where the chat is limited to different words/phrases necessary to the game, but not off task. This new feature I think is extremely helpful, and it makes it so people can talk about the game, instead of other less-appropriate things."
6991,8,-age 5! AND UP
6992,8,"-since the new update, you can't use free chat without an account. the game may be safer, but it is not fun anymore."
6993,8,"-Its not that gory as some of the other reviews say it is, yes, there are death animations, but it in the end, it is just cartoony violence. The way the characters are set up in Among Us make it obvious it is not real. There is some foul language from other players, but chat can be filtered in the settings. Also, there are other chat features and a preset chat for younger players. Honestly, its just a fun little space game with cartoony violence."
6994,8,-It is trash lots of violence and obbusive text
6995,8,-This is a fantastic game! But there's one issue that there's a chat feature where people can chat with each other which might be prone to bad languages. Mature 11+ children can play but parents cotrocontrol recommended
6996,8,"-First of all, I really like the game, and chatting with others to figure out who is the imposter, and people on google play complaining that they can't sign in are not seeing the patches. This is a short review, but the game is really awesome. But sometimes I see people screaming bad words at me, but other than that this is the best."
6997,8,"-I first heard about among us from my friends at school. I then found out more info and decided to see what all the fuss was about this game. End result: one of the funnest games I ever played. It is a great game to play with friends! There are some problems, like language,like Hxrny,need a gf/bf but overall you can censor the chat. And there are some toxic people from time to time, but it is great!"
6998,8,"-First of all, let me tell you that I'm writing this review for the PC version of among us on steam. I like it more."
6999,8,"-okay, please read this thing the whole way though. "
7000,8,"-It’s a really good game and anyone can play it. It depends on the person to decide if it is appropriate or not but in my opinion anyone over 8 can play and some younger if parents say it’s okay. It’s not just a kids game, you can play it whether you are a kid or an adult and it’s very simple to play."
7001,8,"-I think this a a good game. It has good mystery, and it's fun playing with your friends and working with them to find out who the impostors are. The only problem is the chat. This isn't all the time but in most games, there is at least one person that swears, or asks for a gf/bf.  If you are the owner you can easily ban them, but if you are not, then the owner dosen't always ban people. There are also hackers/cheaters that sometimes make the game unfair.  But apart from the chat, it's really good! That's why I think it should be 8+, it could be 7+ too, if your child is mature, and if you are a parent, make sure you talk to your kids about being safe online!"
7002,8,-i think among us is a fun family friendly game and you should definitely download it you can find it in the play store you do have to kill people if your the imposter but nothing to violent i give this game a 10 out of 10 its the best
7003,8,-they are good
7004,8,-THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER DOWNLOAD NOW I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH THAT THE TEACHERS KEEP TAKING AWAY MY PHONE IN CLASS BECAUSE I KEEP PLAYING IT IN CLASS SO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
7005,8,-I LOVE among us. I'm white and people nearly always says ______ is the imposter. Please belive me white. Why do they  always say that??????
7006,8,"-If you are under 7 or older you may have to be mature enough to play. I heard of people playing Among us when they were 6. But I don’t care because I know them. And, you can play among us when you are 7 or under because it’s up to you. Overall, It’s very Fun!"
7007,8,"-It's a really cute game and has a very original idea. There is some violence present, but it's all very cartoonish and no blood is shown. There are dead bodies shown, but in a cartoony way and the body half cut. The language can be a problem, but there is a feature called Censor Chat that can mute out all the bad words. And if anybody is being toxic, you can kick/ban them from the server but only if you are the host."
7008,8,-Positive messages: 2/5
7009,8,"-When crew-mates are killed in Among Us, only the crew-mate being killed will see a mild graphic violence scene (getting strangled, or a knife going into a crew-mates back). Also, players have an option to block explicit language in chat. If you child has it off, your child could be exposed to explicit language other players use. Among Us is not recommended for children under the age of 11."
7010,8,"-I love playing this game with my friends, the game has lots of strategy and is a lot of fun."
7011,8,"-Now while I may be a bit biased, I have to say that there could be much more content in among us, like a better variety of game modes and what not. It's a rather repetitive game, so with more add-ons it could be much better. On the other hand, if anyone is wondering about violence, there's not much to worry about. It's not very gruesome. Then there is the community. You can set it to where it censors swear words, and people generally don't ask for private information. Among Us is overall a pretty good game, but it gets pretty boring after a couple rounds. I'm just speaking for myself, but with more content, this game really could improve."
7012,8,"-I think it is OK for kids 10 and up, there is some violence with the stabbing and neck snapping, but there is no blood and it is completely cartoon. The issue is though with the chat, there are some crazy people who type extremely inappropriate things including words like  f--k, s--t, b--ch and so on.  But other than that it is fine."
7013,8,-This game has risen to be very popular mainly due to it's social feature. 
7014,8,-I love this game it's so fun I recommend the hole family playing it all together (Hint: Two of the most common colors of the imposter are red
